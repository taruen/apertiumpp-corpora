GEN.1.8	God called the expanse [of sky] heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.
GEN.1.9	Then God said, “Let the waters below the heavens be gathered into one place [of standing, pooling together], and let the dry land appear”; and it was so. 
GEN.1.10	God called the dry land earth, and the gathering of the waters He called seas; and God saw that this was good (pleasing, useful)

GEN.1.12	The earth sprouted

GEN.1.16	God made the two great lights—the greater light (the sun) to rule the day, and the lesser light (the moon) to rule the night; 
GEN.1.17	God placed them in the expanse of the heavens to provide light upon the earth, 
GEN.1.18	to rule over the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness; and God saw that it was good 
GEN.1.19	And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
GEN.1.20	Then God said, “Let the waters swarm 
GEN.1.21	God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind; and God saw that it was good 
GEN.1.22	And God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” 
GEN.1.23	And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
GEN.1.24	Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to (limited to, consistent with) their kind: livestock, crawling things, and wild animals of the earth according to their kinds”; and it was so [because He had spoken them into creation]. 
GEN.1.25	So God made the wild animals of the earth according to their kind, and the cattle according to their kind, and everything that creeps 
GEN.1.26	Then God said, “Let Us (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) make man in Our image, according to Our likeness [not physical, but a spiritual personality and moral likeness]; and let them have complete authority over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, the cattle, and over the entire earth, and over everything that creeps 
GEN.1.27	So God created man in His own image, in the image 
GEN.1.28	And God blessed them [granting them certain authority] and said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the earth, and subjugate it [putting it under your power]; and rule over (dominate) the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, and every living thing that moves upon the earth.” 
GEN.1.29	So God said, “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the surface of the entire earth, and every tree which has fruit yielding seed; it shall be food for you; 
GEN.1.30	and to all the animals on the earth and to every bird of the air and to everything that moves on the ground—to everything in which there is the breath of life—
GEN.1.31	God saw everything that He had made, and behold, it was very good 
GEN.2.1	So the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts (inhabitants). 
GEN.2.2	And by the seventh day God completed His work which He had done, and He rested (ceased) on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. 
GEN.2.3	So God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it [as His own, that is, set it apart as holy from other days], because in it He rested from all His work which He had created and done.

GEN.6.19	And of every living thing [found on land], you shall bring two of every kind into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female. 
GEN.6.20	Of fowls

GEN.7.4	For in seven days I am going to cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights; and I will destroy (blot out, wipe away) every living thing that I have made from the surface of the earth.” 
GEN.7.5	So Noah did all that the L
GEN.7.6	Noah was six hundred years old when the flood (deluge) of water came on the earth [covering all of the land]. 
GEN.7.7	Then Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him entered the ark to escape the flood waters. 
GEN.7.8	Of 
GEN.7.9	they came [motivated by God] into the ark with Noah two by two, the male and the female, just as God had commanded Noah. 
GEN.7.10	And after the seven days [God released the rain and] the floodwaters came on the earth. 
GEN.7.11	In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, on the seventeenth day of the second month, on that same day all the fountains of the great deep [subterranean waters] burst open, and the windows 
GEN.7.12	It rained on the earth for forty days and forty nights.
GEN.7.13	On the very same day Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered the ark, 
GEN.7.14	they and every animal according to its kind, all the livestock according to their kinds, every moving thing that crawls on the earth according to its kind, and every bird according to its kind, every winged thing of every sort. 
GEN.7.15	So they went into the ark with Noah, two by two of all living beings in which there was the breath 
GEN.7.16	Those which entered, male and female of all flesh (creatures), entered as God had commanded Noah; and the L
GEN.7.17	The flood [the great downpour of rain] was forty days 
GEN.7.18	The waters became mighty and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the waters. 
GEN.7.19	The waters prevailed so greatly 
GEN.7.20	[In fact] the waters became 
GEN.7.21	All living beings that moved on the earth perished—birds and cattle (domestic animals), [wild] animals, all things that swarm 
GEN.7.22	Everything on the dry land, all in whose nostrils was the breath 
GEN.7.23	God destroyed (blotted out, wiped away) every living thing that was on the surface of the earth; man and animals and the crawling things and the birds of the heavens were destroyed from the land. Only Noah and those who were with him in the ark remained alive. 
GEN.7.24	The waters covered [all of] the earth for a hundred and fifty days (five months).
GEN.8.1	And God remembered 
GEN.8.2	Also the fountains of the deep [subterranean waters] and the windows of the heavens were closed, the [pouring] rain from the sky was restrained, 
GEN.8.3	and the waters receded steadily from the earth. At the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters had diminished. 
GEN.8.4	On the seventeenth day of the seventh month [five months after the rain began], the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat [in 
GEN.8.5	The waters continued to decrease until the tenth month; on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains were seen.
GEN.8.6	At the end of [another] forty days Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made; 
GEN.8.7	and he sent out a raven, which flew here and there until the waters were dried up from the earth. 
GEN.8.8	Then Noah sent out a dove to see if the water level had fallen below the surface of the land. 
GEN.8.9	But the dove found no place on which to rest the sole of her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were [still] on the face of the entire earth. So he reached out his hand and took the dove, and brought her into the ark. 
GEN.8.10	He waited another seven days and again sent the dove out from the ark. 
GEN.8.11	The dove came back to him in the evening, and there, in her beak, was a fresh olive leaf. So Noah knew that the water level had subsided from the earth. 
GEN.8.12	Then he waited another seven days and sent out the dove, but she did not return to him again.
GEN.8.13	Now in the six hundred and first year [of Noah’s life], on the first day of the first month, the waters were drying up from the earth. Then Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and the surface of the ground was drying. 
GEN.8.14	On the twenty-seventh day of the second month the land was [entirely] dry. 
GEN.8.15	And God spoke to Noah, saying, 
GEN.8.16	“Go out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and their wives with you. 
GEN.8.17	Bring out with you every living thing from all flesh—birds and animals and every crawling thing that crawls on the earth—that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.” 
GEN.8.18	So Noah went out, and his wife and his sons and their wives with him [after being in the ark one year and ten days]. 
GEN.8.19	Every animal, every crawling thing, every bird—and whatever moves on the land—went out by families (types, groupings) from the ark.
GEN.8.20	And Noah built an altar to the L
GEN.8.21	The L
GEN.8.22	While the earth remains,
GEN.8.22	Seedtime and harvest,
GEN.8.22	Cold and heat,
GEN.8.22	Winter and summer,
GEN.8.22	And day and night
GEN.8.22	Shall not cease.”
GEN.9.1	And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth. 
GEN.9.2	The fear and the terror of you shall be [instinctive] in every animal of the land and in every bird of the air; and together with everything that moves on the ground, and with all the fish of the sea; they are given into your hand. 
GEN.9.3	Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; I give you everything, as 
GEN.9.4	But you shall not eat meat along with its life, 
GEN.9.5	For your lifeblood I will most certainly require an accounting; from every animal [that kills a person] I will require it. And from man, from every man’s brother [that is, anyone who murders] I will require the life of man.
GEN.9.6	Whoever sheds man’s blood [unlawfully],
GEN.9.6	By man (judicial government) shall his blood be shed,
GEN.9.6	For in the image of God
GEN.9.6	He made man.
GEN.9.7	As for you, be fruitful and multiply;
GEN.9.7	Populate the earth abundantly and multiply in it.”
GEN.9.8	Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying, 
GEN.9.9	“Now behold, I am establishing My covenant (binding agreement, solemn promise) with you and with your descendants after you 
GEN.9.10	and with every living creature that is with you—the birds, the livestock, and the wild animals of the earth along with you, of everything that comes out of the ark—every living creature of the earth. 
GEN.9.11	I will establish My covenant with you: Never again shall all flesh be cut off by the water of a flood, nor shall there ever again be a flood to destroy 
GEN.9.12	And God said, “This is the token (visible symbol, memorial) of the [solemn] covenant which I am making between Me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations; 
GEN.9.13	I set My rainbow in the clouds, and it shall be a sign of a covenant between Me and the earth. 
GEN.9.14	It shall come about, when I bring clouds over the earth, that the rainbow shall be seen in the clouds, 
GEN.9.15	and I will [compassionately] remember My covenant, which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and never again will the water become a flood to destroy all flesh. 
GEN.9.16	When the rainbow is in the clouds and I look at it, I will [solemnly] remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.” 
GEN.9.17	And God said to Noah, “This [rainbow] is the sign of the covenant (solemn pledge, binding agreement) which I have established between Me and all living things on the earth.”
GEN.9.18	The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem and Ham and Japheth. Ham would become the father of Canaan. 
GEN.9.19	These are the three sons of Noah, and from these [men] the whole earth was populated 
GEN.9.20	And Noah began to farm 
GEN.9.21	He drank some of the wine and became drunk, and he was uncovered 
GEN.9.22	Ham, the father of Canaan, saw [by accident] the nakedness of his father, and [to his father’s shame] told his two brothers outside. 
GEN.9.23	So Shem and Japheth took a robe and put it on both their shoulders, and walked backwards and covered the nakedness of their father; their faces were turned away so that they did not see their father’s nakedness. 
GEN.9.24	When Noah awoke from his wine [induced stupor], he knew what his younger son [Ham] had done to him. 
GEN.9.25	So he said,
GEN.9.25	“Cursed be Canaan [the son of Ham];
GEN.9.25	He shall be to his brothers.”
GEN.9.26	He also said,
GEN.9.26	“Blessed be the L
GEN.9.26	The God of 
GEN.9.26	And let Canaan be his servant.
GEN.9.27	May God enlarge [the land of] Japheth,
GEN.9.27	And 
GEN.9.27	And let Canaan be his servant.”
GEN.9.28	Noah lived three hundred and fifty years after the flood. 
GEN.9.29	So all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years, and he died.
GEN.10.1	These are 
GEN.10.2	the sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras; 
GEN.10.3	the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah;

GEN.10.12	and [Nimrod built] Resen, which is between Nineveh and Calah; all these [combined to form] the great city [Nineveh]. 
GEN.10.13	Mizraim [the ancestor of the Egyptians] became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim 
GEN.10.14	and Pathrusim and Casluhim—from whom came the Philistines—and Caphtorim.
GEN.10.15	Canaan became the father of Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth 
GEN.10.16	and the Jebusite and the Amorite and the Girgashite 
GEN.10.17	and the Hivite and the Arkite and the Sinite 
GEN.10.18	and the Arvadite and the Zemarite and the Hamathite. Afterward the families of the Canaanite were spread abroad. 
GEN.10.19	The territory of the Canaanite extended from Sidon as one goes to Gerar, as far as Gaza; and as one goes to

GEN.10.22	The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud and Aram; 
GEN.10.23	the sons of Aram [ancestor of the Syrians]: Uz, Hul, Gether and 
GEN.10.24	Arpachshad became the father of Shelah; and Shelah became the father of Eber. 
GEN.10.25	Two sons were born to Eber; the name of one was Peleg (division), for [the inhabitants of] the earth were divided in his days; and his brother’s name was Joktan. 
GEN.10.26	Joktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 
GEN.10.27	and Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 
GEN.10.28	and 
GEN.10.29	and Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan. 
GEN.10.30	Now their territory extended from Mesha as one goes toward Sephar, to the hill country of the east. 
GEN.10.31	These are Shem’s descendants according to their constituent groups (families), according to their languages, by their lands, according to their nations.

GEN.11.3	They said one to another, “Come, let us make bricks and fire them thoroughly [in a kiln, to harden and strengthen them].” So they used brick for stone [as building material], and they used tar (bitumen, asphalt) for mortar. 
GEN.11.4	They said, “Come, let us build a city for ourselves, and a tower whose top

GEN.11.13	Arpachshad lived four hundred and three years after Shelah was born, and he had

GEN.11.15	Shelah lived four hundred and three years after Eber was born, and he had

GEN.11.17	And Eber lived four hundred and thirty years after Peleg was born, and he had

GEN.11.19	And Peleg lived two hundred and nine years after Reu was born, and he had

GEN.11.21	And Reu lived two hundred and seven years after Serug was born, and he had

GEN.11.23	And Serug lived two hundred years after Nahor was born, and he had 
GEN.11.24	When Nahor had lived twenty-nine years, he became the father of Terah. 
GEN.11.25	And Nahor lived a hundred and nineteen years after Terah was born, and he had

GEN.11.28	Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his birth, in 
GEN.11.29	Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai (later called Sarah), and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and Iscah. 
GEN.11.30	But Sarai was barren; she did not have a child.
GEN.11.31	Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went out together to go from Ur of the Chaldeans into the land of Canaan; but when they came to Haran [about five hundred and fifty miles northwest of Ur], they settled there. 
GEN.11.32	Terah lived two hundred and five years; and Terah died in Haran.
GEN.12.1	Now [in Haran] the L
GEN.12.1	“Go away from your country,

GEN.12.1	And from your father’s house,

GEN.12.2	And I will bless you [abundantly],
GEN.12.2	And make your name great (exalted, distinguished);

GEN.12.3	And I will bless (do good for, benefit) those who bless you,
GEN.12.3	And I will curse [that is, subject to My wrath and judgment] the one who curses (despises, dishonors, has contempt for) you.
GEN.12.3	And in you all the families (nations) of the earth will be blessed.”
GEN.12.4	So Abram departed [in faithful obedience] as the L
GEN.12.5	Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his nephew, and all their possessions which they had acquired, and the people (servants) which they had acquired in Haran, and they set out to go to the land of Canaan. When they came to the land of Canaan, 
GEN.12.6	Abram passed through the land as far as the site of Shechem, to the [great] terebinth (oak) tree of Moreh. Now the

GEN.12.9	Then Abram journeyed on, continuing toward the Negev (the South country of Judah).
GEN.12.10	Now there was a famine in the land; and Abram went down into Egypt to live temporarily, for the famine in the land was oppressive 
GEN.12.11	And when he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, “Listen: I know that you are 
GEN.12.12	so when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife’; and they will kill me [to acquire you], but they will let you live. 
GEN.12.13	Please tell them that you are 
GEN.12.14	And when Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Sarai was very beautiful. 
GEN.12.15	Pharaoh’s princes (officials) also saw her and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken [for the purpose of marriage] into Pharaoh’s house (harem). 
GEN.12.16	Therefore Pharaoh treated Abram well for her sake; he acquired sheep, oxen, male and female donkeys, male and female servants, and camels.
GEN.12.17	But the L
GEN.12.18	Then Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this that you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife? 
GEN.12.19	Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her as my wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her and go!” 
GEN.12.20	So Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him; and they escorted him on his way, with his wife and all that he had.
GEN.13.1	So Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot [his nephew] with him, into the Negev (the South country of Judah).
GEN.13.2	Now Abram was extremely rich in livestock and in silver and in gold. 
GEN.13.3	He journeyed on from the Negev as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, 
GEN.13.4	where he had first built an altar; and there Abram called on the name of the L
GEN.13.5	But Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents. 
GEN.13.6	Now the land was not able to support them [that is, sustain all their grazing and water needs] while they lived near one another, for their possessions were too great for them to stay together. 
GEN.13.7	And there was strife 
GEN.13.8	So Abram said to Lot, “Please let there be no strife 
GEN.13.9	Is not the entire land before you? Please separate [yourself] from me. If you take the left, then I will go to the right; or if you choose the right, then I will go to the left.” 
GEN.13.10	So Lot looked and saw that the valley of the Jordan was well watered everywhere—this was before the L
GEN.13.11	Then Lot chose for himself all the valley of the Jordan, and he traveled east. So they separated from each other. 
GEN.13.12	Abram settled in the land of Canaan, and Lot settled in the cities of the valley and camped as far as Sodom 
GEN.13.13	But the men of Sodom were extremely wicked and sinful against the L

GEN.13.15	for all the land which you see I will give to you and to your descendants forever. 
GEN.13.16	I will make your descendants [as numerous] as the dust of the earth, so that if a man could count the [grains of] dust of the earth, then your descendants could also be counted. 
GEN.13.17	Arise, walk (make a thorough reconnaissance) around in the land, through its length and its width, for I will give it to you.” 
GEN.13.18	Then Abram broke camp 
GEN.14.1	In the days of the [Eastern] kings Amraphel of Shinar, Arioch of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer of Elam, and Tidal of Goiim, 
GEN.14.2	they [invaded the Jordan Valley near the Dead Sea, and] made war with Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela 
GEN.14.3	All of these [kings] joined together [as allies] in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Sea of Salt). 
GEN.14.4	Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer [the most powerful king in the invading confederacy], but in the thirteenth year they rebelled. 
GEN.14.5	In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the [three] kings who were with him attacked and subdued the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim, 
GEN.14.6	and the Horites in their mountainous country of Seir, as far as El-paran, which is on the border of the wilderness. 
GEN.14.7	Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and subdued all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who lived in Hazazon-tamar. 
GEN.14.8	Then the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela (that is, Zoar) came out; and they joined together for battle with the invading kings in the Valley of Siddim, 
GEN.14.9	against Chedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goiim and Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against five. 
GEN.14.10	Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar (bitumen) pits; and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, they fell into them. But the remainder [of the kings] who survived fled to the hill country. 
GEN.14.11	Then the victors took all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food supply 
GEN.14.12	And they also took [captive] Lot, Abram’s nephew, and his possessions and left, for he was living in Sodom.
GEN.14.13	Then a survivor who had escaped [from the invading forces on the other side of the Jordan] came and told Abram the 
GEN.14.14	When Abram heard that his nephew [Lot] had been captured, he armed 
GEN.14.15	He divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and attacked 
GEN.14.16	And he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his nephew Lot and his possessions, and also the women, and the people.
GEN.14.17	Then after Abram’s return from the defeat (slaughter) of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley). 
GEN.14.18	Melchizedek king of Salem (ancient Jerusalem) brought out bread and wine [for them]; he was the priest of 
GEN.14.19	And Melchizedek blessed Abram and said,
GEN.14.19	“Blessed (joyful, favored) be Abram by God Most High,
GEN.14.19	Creator 
GEN.14.20	And blessed, praised, 
GEN.14.20	Who has given your enemies into your hand.”
GEN.14.20	And Abram gave him a tenth of all [the treasure he had taken in battle]. 
GEN.14.21	The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people and keep the goods (spoils of battle) for yourself.” 
GEN.14.22	But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have raised my hand 
GEN.14.23	that I would not take anything that is yours, from a thread to a sandal strap, so you could not say, ‘I [the King of Sodom] have made Abram rich.’ 
GEN.14.24	I will take nothing except what my young men have eaten, and the share of the spoils belonging to the men [my allies] who went with me—Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their share of the spoils.”
GEN.15.1	After these things the word of the L
GEN.15.1	“Do not be afraid, Abram,
GEN.15.1	I am your shield;
GEN.15.1	Your reward [for obedience] shall be very great.”
GEN.15.2	Abram said, “Lord 
GEN.15.3	And Abram continued, “Since You have given no child to me, one (a servant) born in my house is my heir.” 
GEN.15.4	Then behold, the word of the L
GEN.15.5	And the L
GEN.15.6	Then Abram believed in (affirmed, trusted in, relied on, remained steadfast to) the L
GEN.15.7	And He said to him, “I am the [same] L
GEN.15.8	But Abram said, “Lord 
GEN.15.9	So God said to him, “Bring Me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.” 
GEN.15.10	So Abram brought all these to Him and 
GEN.15.11	The birds of prey swooped down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.
GEN.15.12	When the sun was setting, a deep sleep overcame Abram; and a horror (terror, shuddering fear, nightmare) of great darkness overcame him. 
GEN.15.13	 said to Abram, “Know for sure that your descendants will be strangers [living temporarily] in a land (Egypt) that is not theirs, where they will be enslaved and oppressed for four hundred years. 
GEN.15.14	But on that nation whom your descendants will serve I will bring judgment, and afterward they will come out [of that land] with great possessions. 
GEN.15.15	As for you, you shall [die and] go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried at a good old age. 
GEN.15.16	Then in the 
GEN.15.17	When the sun had gone down and a [deep] darkness had come, 
GEN.15.18	On the same day the L
GEN.15.18	“To your descendants I have given this land,
GEN.15.18	From the river of Egypt to the great river Euphrates—
GEN.15.19	[the land of] the Kenites and the Kenizzites and the Kadmonites 
GEN.15.20	and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Rephaim, 
GEN.15.21	the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Girgashites and the Jebusites.”
GEN.16.1	Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had not borne him any 
GEN.16.2	So Sarai said to Abram, “See here, the L
GEN.16.3	After Abram had lived in the land of Canaan ten years, Abram’s wife Sarai took Hagar the Egyptian [maid], and gave her to her husband Abram to be his [secondary] wife. 
GEN.16.4	He went in to [the bed of] Hagar, and she conceived; and when she realized that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress [regarding Sarai as insignificant because of her infertility]. 
GEN.16.5	Then Sarai said to Abram, “May [the responsibility for] the wrong done to me [by the arrogant behavior of Hagar] be upon you. I gave my maid into your arms, and when she realized that she had conceived, I was despised 
GEN.16.6	But Abram said to Sarai, “Look, your maid is 
GEN.16.7	But 
GEN.16.8	And He said, “Hagar, Sarai’s maid, where did you come from and where are you going?” And she said, “I am running away from my mistress Sarai.” 
GEN.16.9	The Angel of the L
GEN.16.10	Then the Angel of the L
GEN.16.11	The Angel of the L
GEN.16.11	“Behold, you are with child,
GEN.16.11	And you will bear a son;
GEN.16.11	And you shall name him Ishmael (God hears),
GEN.16.11	Because the L
GEN.16.12	He (Ishmael) will be a wild donkey of a man;
GEN.16.12	His hand 
GEN.16.12	And every man’s hand against him;
GEN.16.12	And he will dwell in defiance of all his brothers.”
GEN.16.13	Then she called the name of the L
GEN.16.14	Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi (Well of the Living One Who Sees Me); it is 
GEN.16.15	So Hagar gave birth to Abram’s son; and Abram named his son, to whom Hagar gave birth, 
GEN.16.16	Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael.
GEN.17.1	When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the 
GEN.17.1	“I am 
GEN.17.1	Walk [habitually] before Me [with integrity, knowing that you are always in My presence], and be blameless 
GEN.17.2	I will establish My covenant (everlasting promise) between Me and you,
GEN.17.2	And I will multiply you exceedingly [through your descendants].”
GEN.17.3	Then Abram fell on his face [in worship], and God spoke with him, saying,
GEN.17.4	“As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you,
GEN.17.4	And [as a result] you shall be the father of many nations.
GEN.17.5	No longer shall your name be Abram (exalted father),
GEN.17.5	But your name shall be Abraham (father of a multitude);
GEN.17.5	For I will make you the father of many nations.
GEN.17.6	I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you, and 
GEN.17.7	I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your descendants after you. 
GEN.17.8	I will give to you and to your descendants after you the land in which you are a stranger [moving from place to place], all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting possession [of property]; and I will be their God.”
GEN.17.9	Further, God said to Abraham, “As for you [your part of the agreement], you shall keep 
GEN.17.10	This is [the sign of] My covenant, which you shall keep 
GEN.17.11	And you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be the sign (symbol, memorial) of the covenant between Me and you. 
GEN.17.12	Every male among you who is eight days old shall be circumcised throughout your generations, [including] a 
GEN.17.13	A 
GEN.17.14	And the male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that person shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.”
GEN.17.15	Then God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai (my princess), but her name will be Sarah (
GEN.17.16	I will bless her, and indeed I will also give you a son by her. Yes, I will bless her, and she shall be a 
GEN.17.17	Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, “Shall a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? And shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear 
GEN.17.18	And Abraham said to God, “Oh, that Ishmael [my firstborn] might live before You!” 
GEN.17.19	But God said, “No, Sarah your wife shall bear you a son indeed, and you shall name him Isaac (laughter); and I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his descendants after him. 
GEN.17.20	As for Ishmael, I have heard 
GEN.17.21	But My covenant [My promise, My solemn pledge], I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this time next year.” 
GEN.17.22	And God finished speaking with him and went up from Abraham.
GEN.17.23	Then Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all 
GEN.17.24	So Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised. 
GEN.17.25	And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised. 
GEN.17.26	On the very same day Abraham was circumcised, as well as Ishmael his son. 
GEN.17.27	All the men [servants] of his household, both those born in the house and those purchased with money from a foreigner, were circumcised along with him [as the sign of God’s covenant with Abraham].
GEN.18.1	Now the L
GEN.18.2	When he raised his eyes and looked up, behold, three men were standing [a little distance] from him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed down [with his face] to the ground, 
GEN.18.3	and Abraham said, “My 
GEN.18.4	Please let a little water be brought [by one of my servants] and [you may] wash your feet, and recline 
GEN.18.5	And I will bring a piece of bread to refresh 
GEN.18.6	So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, “Quickly, get ready three

GEN.18.8	Then he took

GEN.18.10	He said, “I will surely return to you at this

GEN.18.12	So Sarah laughed to herself [when she heard the L

GEN.18.27	Abraham answered, “Now behold, I who am but dust [in origin] and ashes have decided to speak to the Lord. 
GEN.18.28	If five of the fifty righteous are lacking, will You destroy the entire city for lack of five?” And He said, “If I find [at least] forty-five [righteous people] there, I will not destroy it.” 
GEN.18.29	Abraham spoke to Him yet again and said, “Suppose [only] forty are found there.” And He said, “I will not do it for the sake of the forty [who are righteous].” 
GEN.18.30	Then Abraham said [to Him], “Oh, may the Lord not be angry, and I will speak; suppose thirty [righteous people] are found there?” And He said, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.” 
GEN.18.31	And he said, “Now behold, I have decided to speak to the Lord [again]. Suppose [only] twenty [righteous people] are found there?” And the Lord said, “I will not destroy it for the sake of the twenty.” 
GEN.18.32	Then Abraham said, “Oh may the Lord not be angry [with me], and I will speak only this once; suppose ten [righteous people] are found there?” And He said, “I will not destroy it for the sake of the ten.” 
GEN.18.33	As soon as He had finished speaking with Abraham the L
GEN.19.1	It was evening when the two angels came to Sodom. Lot was sitting at Sodom’s [
GEN.19.2	And he said, “See here, my lords, please turn aside 
GEN.19.3	However, Lot strongly urged them, so they turned aside and entered his house; and he prepared a feast for them [with wine], and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. 
GEN.19.4	But before they lay down [to sleep], the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, surrounded the house, 
GEN.19.5	and they called out to Lot and said to him, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we may know them [intimately].” 
GEN.19.6	But Lot went out of the doorway to the men, and shut the door after him, 
GEN.19.7	and said, “Please, my brothers, do not do something so wicked. 
GEN.19.8	See here, I have two daughters who have not known a man [intimately]; please let me bring them out to you [instead], and you can do as you please with them; only do nothing to these men, because they have in fact come under the shelter of my roof [for protection].” 
GEN.19.9	But they said, “Get out of the way!” And they said, “This man (Lot) came [as an outsider] to live here temporarily, and now he is acting like a judge. Now we will treat you worse than your visitors!” So they rushed forward 
GEN.19.10	But the men (angels) reached out with their hands and pulled Lot into the house with them, and shut the door [after him]. 
GEN.19.11	They struck (punished) the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness, from the young men to the old men, so that they exhausted

GEN.19.15	When morning dawned, the angels urged Lot [to hurry], saying, “Get up! Take your wife and two daughters who are here [and go], or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city.” 
GEN.19.16	But Lot hesitated 
GEN.19.17	When they had brought them outside, one [of the angels] said, “Escape for your life! Do not look behind you, or stop anywhere in the entire valley; escape to the mountains [of Moab], or you will be consumed 
GEN.19.18	But Lot said to them, “Oh no, [not that place] my lords! 
GEN.19.19	Please listen, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your lovingkindness (mercy) to me by saving my life; but I cannot escape to the mountains, because the disaster will overtake me and I will be killed. 
GEN.19.20	Now look, this town [in the distance] is near 
GEN.19.21	And the angel said to him, “Behold, I grant you this request also; I will not destroy this town of which you have spoken. 
GEN.19.22	Hurry and take refuge there, for I cannot do anything [to punish Sodom] until you arrive there.” For this reason the town was named Zoar (few, small).
GEN.19.23	The sun had risen over the earth when Lot came to Zoar. 
GEN.19.24	Then the L
GEN.19.25	and He overthrew (demolished, ended) those cities, and the entire valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and whatever grew on the ground. 
GEN.19.26	But Lot’s wife, from behind him, [foolishly, longingly] looked [back toward Sodom in an act of disobedience], and she 
GEN.19.27	Abraham started out early the next morning to the place where he [only the day before] had stood before the L
GEN.19.28	and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the valley [of the Dead Sea]; and he saw, and behold, the smoke of 
GEN.19.29	Now when God ravaged 
GEN.19.30	Now Lot went up from Zoar, and lived in the mountain together with his two daughters, for he was afraid to stay [any longer] in Zoar; and he lived in a cave with his two daughters. 
GEN.19.31	The firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is aging, and there is not a man on earth [available] to be intimate with us in the customary way [so that we may have children]. 
GEN.19.32	Come, let us make our father drunk with wine, and we will lie with him so that we may preserve our family through our father.” 
GEN.19.33	So they gave their father wine that night, and the firstborn went in and lay with her father; and he did not know when she lay down or when she got up [because he was completely intoxicated]. 
GEN.19.34	Then the next day, the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay with my father last night; let us make him drunk with wine tonight also, and then you go in and lie with him, so that we may preserve our family through our father.” 
GEN.19.35	So they gave their father wine that night also, and the younger got up and lay with him; and 
GEN.19.36	Thus both the daughters of Lot conceived by their father. 
GEN.19.37	The firstborn gave birth to a son, and named him Moab (from father); he is the father of the Moabites to this day. 
GEN.19.38	The younger also gave birth to a son and named him Ben-ammi (son of my people); he is the father of the Ammonites to this day.
GEN.20.1	Now Abraham journeyed from there toward the Negev (the South country), and settled between Kadesh and Shur; then he lived temporarily in Gerar. 
GEN.20.2	Abraham 
GEN.20.3	But God came to Abimelech in a dream during the night, and said, “Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken [as your wife], for she is another man’s wife.” 
GEN.20.4	Now Abimelech had not yet come near her; so he said, “Lord, will you kill a people who are righteous 
GEN.20.5	Did Abraham not tell me, ‘She is my sister?’ And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands I have done this.” 
GEN.20.6	Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know you did this in the integrity of your heart, for it was I who kept you back 
GEN.20.7	So now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return 
GEN.20.8	So Abimelech got up early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things; and the men were terrified. 
GEN.20.9	Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? And how have I offended you that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me what ought not to be done [to anyone].” 
GEN.20.10	And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What have you encountered 
GEN.20.11	Abraham said, “Because I thought, ‘Surely there is no fear 
GEN.20.12	Besides, she actually is my [half] sister; she is the daughter of my father [Terah], but not of my mother; and she became my wife. 
GEN.20.13	When God caused me to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘This kindness 
GEN.20.14	Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen and male and female slaves, and gave them to Abraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him [as God commanded]. 
GEN.20.15	So Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you; settle wherever you please.” 
GEN.20.16	Then to Sarah he said, “Look, I have given this brother of yours a 
GEN.20.17	So Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maids, and they 
GEN.20.18	for the L
GEN.21.1	The L
GEN.21.2	So Sarah conceived and gave birth to a son for Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him. 
GEN.21.3	Abraham named his son Isaac (laughter), 
GEN.21.4	So Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, just as God had commanded him. 
GEN.21.5	Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born. 
GEN.21.6	Sarah said, “God has made me laugh; all who hear [about our good news] will laugh with me.” 
GEN.21.7	And she said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? For I have given birth to a son by him in his old age.”
GEN.21.8	The child [Isaac] grew and was 
GEN.21.9	Now [as time went on] Sarah saw [Ishmael] the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, 
GEN.21.10	Therefore she said to Abraham, “Drive out this maid and her son, for the son of this maid shall not be an heir with my son Isaac.” 
GEN.21.11	The situation 
GEN.21.12	God said to Abraham, “Do not let it distress you because of Ishmael and your maid; whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her 
GEN.21.13	And I will also make a nation of [Ishmael] the son of the maid, because he is your descendant.” 
GEN.21.14	So Abraham got up early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar, putting them on her shoulder, and 
GEN.21.15	When the water in the skin was all gone, Hagar abandoned the boy under one of the bushes. 
GEN.21.16	Then she went and sat down opposite him, about a bowshot away, for she said, “Do not let me see the boy die.” And as she sat down opposite him, she raised her voice and wept. 
GEN.21.17	God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy from where he is [resting]. 
GEN.21.18	Get up, help the boy up, and hold him by the hand, for I will make him a great nation.” 
GEN.21.19	Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the [empty] skin with water and gave the boy a drink.
GEN.21.20	God was with Ishmael, and he grew 
GEN.21.21	He lived in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
GEN.21.22	Now at that time Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, said to Abraham, “God is with you in everything you do; 
GEN.21.23	so now, swear to me here by God that you will not deal unfairly with me [by breaking any agreements we have] or with my son or with my descendants, but as I have treated you with kindness, you shall do the same to me and to the land in which you have sojourned (temporarily lived).” 
GEN.21.24	And Abraham said, “I will swear.” 
GEN.21.25	Then Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well of water which the servants of Abimelech had [violently] seized [from him], 
GEN.21.26	Abimelech said, “I do not know who did this thing. Indeed, you did not tell me, and I did not hear of it until today.”
GEN.21.27	So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant (binding agreement). 
GEN.21.28	Then Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs of the flock, 
GEN.21.29	and Abimelech said to Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs which you have set apart?” 
GEN.21.30	Abraham said, “You are to accept these seven ewe lambs from me as a witness for me, that I dug this well.” 
GEN.21.31	Therefore that place was called Beersheba (Well of the Oath or Well of the Seven), because there the two of them swore an oath. 
GEN.21.32	So they made a covenant at Beersheba; then Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, got up and returned to the land of the Philistines. 
GEN.21.33	Abraham planted a tamarisk tree at Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the L
GEN.21.34	And Abraham lived [as a resident alien] in the land of the Philistines for 
GEN.22.1	Now after these things, God tested [the faith and commitment of] Abraham and said to him, “Abraham!” And he answered, “Here I am.” 
GEN.22.2	God said, “Take now your son, your only son [of 
GEN.22.3	So Abraham got up early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him and his son Isaac; and he split the wood for the burnt offering, and then he got up and went to the place of which God had told him. 
GEN.22.4	On the third day [of travel] Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance. 
GEN.22.5	Abraham said to his servants, “Settle down 
GEN.22.6	Then Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it 
GEN.22.7	And Isaac said to Abraham, “My father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” Isaac said, “Look, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?” 
GEN.22.8	Abraham said, “My son, God will provide for Himself 
GEN.22.9	When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood, and bound Isaac his son and placed him on the altar, on top of the wood. 
GEN.22.10	Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to 
GEN.22.11	But the 
GEN.22.12	The L
GEN.22.13	Then Abraham looked up and glanced around, and behold, behind him was a ram caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up for a burnt offering (ascending sacrifice) instead of his son. 
GEN.22.14	So Abraham named that place 
GEN.22.15	The 
GEN.22.16	and said, “By Myself (on the basis of Who I Am) I have sworn [an oath], declares the L
GEN.22.17	indeed I will greatly bless you, and I will greatly multiply your descendants like the stars of the heavens and like the sand on the seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies [as conquerors]. 
GEN.22.18	Through your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have heard 
GEN.22.19	So Abraham returned to his servants, and they got up and went with him to Beersheba; and Abraham settled in Beersheba.
GEN.22.20	Now after these things Abraham was told, “Milcah has borne children to your brother Nahor: 
GEN.22.21	Uz the firstborn and Buz his brother and Kemuel the father of Aram, 
GEN.22.22	Chesed and Hazo and Pildash and Jidlaph and Bethuel.” 
GEN.22.23	Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. These eight [children] Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother. 
GEN.22.24	Nahor’s 
GEN.23.1	Sarah lived a hundred and twenty-seven years; this was the length of the life of Sarah. 
GEN.23.2	Sarah died in Kiriath-arba 
GEN.23.3	Then Abraham stood up before his dead [wife’s body], and spoke to the 
GEN.23.4	“I am a stranger and a sojourner (resident alien) among you; give (sell) me property for a burial place among you so that I may bury my dead [in the proper manner].” 
GEN.23.5	The Hittites replied to Abraham, 
GEN.23.6	“Listen to us, my lord; you are a prince of God [a mighty prince] among us; bury your dead in the choicest of our graves; none of us will refuse you his grave 
GEN.23.7	So Abraham stood up and bowed to the people of the land, the Hittites. 
GEN.23.8	And Abraham said to them, “If you are willing to grant my dead a [proper] burial, listen to me, and plead with Ephron the son of Zohar for me, 
GEN.23.9	so that he may give (sell) me the cave of Machpelah which he owns—it is at the end of his field; let him give it to me here in your presence for the full price as a burial site [which I may keep forever among you].” 
GEN.23.10	Now Ephron was present there among the sons of Heth; so within the hearing of all the sons of Heth and all who were entering the gate of his city, Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham, saying, 
GEN.23.11	“No, my lord, hear me; I 
GEN.23.12	Then Abraham bowed down before the people of the land. 
GEN.23.13	He said to Ephron in the presence of the people of the land, “If you will only please listen to me 
GEN.23.14	Ephron replied to Abraham, 
GEN.23.15	“My lord, listen to me. The land [you seek] is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that between you and me? So bury your dead.” 
GEN.23.16	So Abraham listened to Ephron [and agreed to his terms]; and he weighed out for Ephron the [amount of] silver which he had named in the hearing of the Hittites: four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weights current among the merchants.
GEN.23.17	So the field of Ephron in Machpelah, which was to the east of Mamre (Hebron)—the field and the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field and in all its borders around it—were deeded over [legally] 
GEN.23.18	to Abraham as his possession in the presence of the Hittites, before all who were entering at the gate of his city. 
GEN.23.19	After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of 
GEN.23.20	The field and the cave in it were deeded over to Abraham by the Hittites as a [permanent] possession 
GEN.24.1	Now Abraham was old, [well] advanced in age; and the L
GEN.24.2	Abraham said to his servant [Eliezer of Damascus], the oldest of his household, who had charge over all that Abraham owned, “Please, put your hand under my thigh [as is customary for affirming a solemn oath], 
GEN.24.3	and I will make you swear by the L
GEN.24.4	but you will [instead] go to my [former] country (Mesopotamia) and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac [the heir of the covenant promise].” 
GEN.24.5	The servant said to him, “Suppose the woman will not be willing to follow me back to this country; should I take your son back to the country from which you came?” 
GEN.24.6	Abraham said to him, “See to it that you do not take my son back there! 
GEN.24.7	The L
GEN.24.8	If the woman is not willing to follow you [to this land], then you will be free from this my oath 
GEN.24.9	So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.
GEN.24.10	Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels, and set out, taking some of his master’s good things with him; so he got up and journeyed to 
GEN.24.11	He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of the evening when women go out to draw water. 
GEN.24.12	And he said, “O L
GEN.24.13	Behold, I stand here at the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water; 
GEN.24.14	now let it be that the girl to whom I say, ‘Please, let down your jar so that I may [have a] drink,’ and she replies, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels water to drink’—may she 
GEN.24.15	Before Eliezer had finished speaking (praying), Rebekah came out with her [water] jar on her shoulder. Rebekah was the daughter of Bethuel the 
GEN.24.16	The girl was very beautiful, a virgin and unmarried; and she went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up. 
GEN.24.17	Then the servant ran to meet her, and said, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar.” 
GEN.24.18	And she said, “Drink, my lord”; and she quickly lowered her jar to her hand, and gave him a drink. 
GEN.24.19	When she had given Eliezer a drink, she said, “I will also draw water for your camels until they have finished drinking.” 
GEN.24.20	So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, and ran again to the well and drew water for all his camels. 
GEN.24.21	Meanwhile, the man stood gazing at Rebekah in [reverent] silence, [waiting] to know if the L
GEN.24.22	When the camels had finished drinking, Eliezer took a gold ring weighing a half-shekel and two bracelets for her hands weighing ten shekels in gold, 
GEN.24.23	and said, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father’s house for us to lodge?” 
GEN.24.24	And she said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, Milcah’s son, whom she bore to [her husband] Nahor.” 
GEN.24.25	Again she said to him, “We have plenty of both straw and feed, and also room to lodge.” 
GEN.24.26	The man bowed his head and worshiped the L
GEN.24.27	He said, “Blessed be the L
GEN.24.28	Then the girl ran and told her mother’s household what had happened. 
GEN.24.29	Now Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban; and Laban ran out to the man at the well. 
GEN.24.30	When he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister’s arms, and when he heard Rebekah his sister, saying, “The man said this to me,” he went to Eliezer and found him standing by the camels at the spring. 
GEN.24.31	And Laban said, “Come in, blessed of the L
GEN.24.32	So the man came into the house, and Laban unloaded his camels and gave them straw and feed, and [he gave] water to [Eliezer to] wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. 
GEN.24.33	But when food was set before him, he said, “I will not eat until I have stated my business.” And Laban said, “Speak on.” 
GEN.24.34	So he said, “I am Abraham’s servant. 
GEN.24.35	The L
GEN.24.36	Now Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master when she was in her old age, and he has given everything that he has to him. 
GEN.24.37	My master made me swear [an oath], saying, ‘You must not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live; 
GEN.24.38	but you shall [instead] go to my father’s house and to my family and take a wife for my son [Isaac].’ 
GEN.24.39	Then I said to my master, ‘But suppose the woman will not follow me [back to this land].’ 
GEN.24.40	He said to me, ‘The L
GEN.24.41	then you will be free of my oath, when you come to my relatives; and if they do not give her to you, you will [also] be free of my oath.’
GEN.24.42	“I came today to the spring, and said, ‘O L
GEN.24.43	please look, I am standing by the spring of water; now let it be that when the maiden [whom You have chosen for Isaac] comes out to draw [water], and to whom I say, “Please, give me a little water to drink from your jar”; 
GEN.24.44	and if she says to me, “You drink, and I will also draw [water] for your camels”; let that woman be the one whom the L
GEN.24.45	“Before I had finished praying in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her [water] jar on her shoulder, and she went down to the spring and drew water. And I said to her, ‘Please, let me have a drink.’ 
GEN.24.46	And she quickly let down her jar from her 
GEN.24.47	Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him’; and I 
GEN.24.48	And I bowed down my head and worshiped the L
GEN.24.49	So now if you are going to show kindness and truth to my master [being faithful to him], tell me; and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right or to the left [and go on my way].”
GEN.24.50	Then Laban and Bethuel answered, “The matter has come from the L
GEN.24.51	Rebekah is before you; take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master’s son, as the L
GEN.24.52	When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the ground [in worship] before the L
GEN.24.53	Then the servant brought out jewelry of silver, jewelry of gold, and articles of clothing, and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave precious things to her brother and her mother. 
GEN.24.54	Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night [there]. In the morning when they got up, he said, “Now send me back to my master.” 
GEN.24.55	But Rebekah’s brother and mother said, “Let the girl stay with us a few days—at least ten; then she may go.” 
GEN.24.56	But Eliezer said to them, “Do not delay me, since the L
GEN.24.57	And they said, “We will call the girl and ask her 
GEN.24.58	So they called Rebekah and said, “Will you go with this man?” And she answered, “I will go.” 
GEN.24.59	So they sent off their sister Rebekah and her nurse [Deborah, as her attendant] and Abraham’s servant [Eliezer] and his men. 
GEN.24.60	They blessed Rebekah and said to her,
GEN.24.60	“May you, our sister,
GEN.24.60	Become [the mother of] thousands of ten thousands,
GEN.24.60	And may your descendants possess (conquer)
GEN.24.60	The [city] gate of those who hate them.”
GEN.24.61	Then Rebekah and her attendants 
GEN.24.62	Now Isaac had returned from going to Beer-lahai-roi (Well of the Living One Who Sees Me), for he was living in the 
GEN.24.63	Isaac went out to bow down [in prayer] in the field in the [early] evening; he raised his eyes and looked, and camels were coming. 
GEN.24.64	Rebekah also raised her eyes 
GEN.24.65	She said to the servant, “Who is that man there walking across the field to meet us?” And the servant said, “He is my master [Isaac].” So she took a veil and covered herself [as was customary]. 
GEN.24.66	The servant told Isaac everything that he had done. 
GEN.24.67	Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and he took Rebekah [in marriage], and she became his wife, and he loved her; therefore Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.
GEN.25.1	Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah. 
GEN.25.2	She gave birth to Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 
GEN.25.3	Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim. 
GEN.25.4	The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the sons of Keturah. 
GEN.25.5	Now Abraham gave 
GEN.25.6	but to the sons of his 
GEN.25.7	The days of Abraham’s life were a hundred and seventy-five years. 
GEN.25.8	Then Abraham breathed his last and he died at a good old age, an old man who was satisfied [with life]; and he

GEN.25.10	the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth; there Abraham was buried with Sarah his wife. 
GEN.25.11	Now after the death of Abraham, God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac lived at Beer-lahai-roi.
GEN.25.12	Now 
GEN.25.13	and these are the names of the [twelve] sons of Ishmael, named in the order of their births: Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael, and Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 
GEN.25.14	Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 
GEN.25.15	Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 
GEN.25.16	These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names, by their settlements, and by their encampments (sheepfolds); twelve princes (sheiks) according to their tribes. 
GEN.25.17	Ishmael lived a hundred and thirty-seven years; then he breathed his last and died, and 
GEN.25.18	Ishmael’s sons (descendants) settled from Havilah to Shur which is 
GEN.25.19	Now these are 
GEN.25.20	Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean (Syrian) of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean. 
GEN.25.21	Isaac prayed to the L

GEN.25.23	And the separation of two nations has begun in your body;
GEN.25.23	The one people shall be stronger than the other;
GEN.25.23	And the older shall serve the younger.”
GEN.25.24	When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. 
GEN.25.25	The first came out reddish all over like a hairy garment; and they named him Esau (hairy). 
GEN.25.26	Afterward his brother came out, and his hand grasped Esau’s heel, so he was named Jacob (
GEN.25.27	When the boys grew up, Esau was an able 
GEN.25.28	Now Isaac loved [and favored] Esau, because 
GEN.25.29	Jacob had cooked [reddish-brown lentil] stew [one day], when Esau came from the field and was famished;

GEN.25.33	Jacob said, “Swear [an oath] to me today [that you are selling it to me for this food]”; so he swore [an oath] to him, and sold him his birthright. 
GEN.25.34	Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew; and he ate and drank, and got up and went on his way. In this way Esau scorned his birthright.
GEN.26.1	Now there was a famine in the land [of Canaan], besides the previous famine that had occurred in the days of Abraham. So Isaac went to Gerar, to

GEN.26.7	The men of the place asked him about his wife, and he said, “She is my 
GEN.26.8	It happened when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out of a window and saw Isaac 
GEN.26.9	Then Abimelech called Isaac and said, “See here, Rebekah is in fact your wife! How did you [dare to] say to me, ‘She is my sister’?” And Isaac said to him, “Because I thought I might be killed because of her [desirability].” 
GEN.26.10	Abimelech said, “What is this that you have done to us? One of the men [among our people] might easily have been intimate with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us [before God].” 
GEN.26.11	Then Abimelech commanded all his people, “Whoever touches this man [Isaac] or his wife [Rebekah] shall without exception be put to death.”
GEN.26.12	Then Isaac planted [seed] in that land [as a farmer] and reaped in the same year a hundred times [as much as he had planted], and the L
GEN.26.13	And the man [Isaac] became great and gained more and more until he became very wealthy 
GEN.26.14	he owned flocks and herds and a great household [with a number of servants], and the Philistines envied him. 
GEN.26.15	Now all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines stopped up by filling them with dirt. 
GEN.26.16	Then Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from here, because you are far too powerful for us.” 
GEN.26.17	So Isaac left that region and camped in the Valley of Gerar, and settled there.
GEN.26.18	Now Isaac again dug [and reopened] the wells of water which had been dug in the days of Abraham his father, because the Philistines had filled them up [with dirt] after the death of Abraham; and he gave the wells the same names that his father had given them. 
GEN.26.19	But when Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found there a well of flowing [spring] water, 
GEN.26.20	the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours!” So Isaac named the well Esek (quarreling), because they quarreled with him. 
GEN.26.21	Then his servants dug another well, and they quarreled over that also, so Isaac named it Sitnah (enmity). 
GEN.26.22	He moved away from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over that one; so he named it Rehoboth (broad places), saying, “For now the L
GEN.26.23	Then he went up from there to Beersheba. 
GEN.26.24	The L
GEN.26.24	“I am the God of Abraham your father;
GEN.26.24	Do not be afraid, for I am with you.
GEN.26.24	I will bless 
GEN.26.24	For the sake of My servant Abraham.”
GEN.26.25	So Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the L
GEN.26.26	Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath, his [close friend and confidential] adviser, and Phicol, the commander of his army. 
GEN.26.27	Isaac said to them, “Why have you [people] come to me, since you hate me and have sent me away from you?” 
GEN.26.28	They said, “We see clearly that the L
GEN.26.29	that you will not harm us, just as we have not touched you and have done nothing but good to you and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed 
GEN.26.30	Then Isaac held a [formal] banquet (covenant feast) for them, and they ate and drank. 
GEN.26.31	They got up early in the morning and swore oaths [pledging to do nothing but good to each other]; and Isaac sent them on their way and they left him in peace. 
GEN.26.32	Now on the same day, Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well they had dug, saying, “We have found water.” 
GEN.26.33	So he named the well 
GEN.26.34	When Esau was forty years old he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite as his wives; 
GEN.26.35	and they were a 
GEN.27.1	Now when Isaac was old and his eyes were too dim to see, he called his elder [and favorite] son Esau and said to him, “My son.” And Esau answered him, “Here I am.” 
GEN.27.2	Isaac said, “See here, I am old; 
GEN.27.3	So now, please take your [hunting] gear, your quiver [of arrows] and your bow, and go out into the open country and hunt game for me; 
GEN.27.4	and make me a savory 
GEN.27.5	But Rebekah overheard what Isaac said to Esau his son; and when Esau had gone to the open country to hunt for game that he might bring back, 
GEN.27.6	Rebekah said to Jacob her [younger and favorite] son, “Listen carefully: I heard your father saying to Esau your brother, 
GEN.27.7	‘Bring me some game and make me a savory 
GEN.27.8	So now, my son, listen [carefully] to me [and do exactly] as I command you. 
GEN.27.9	Go now to the flock and bring me two good 
GEN.27.10	Then you shall bring it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before his death.” 
GEN.27.11	Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Listen, Esau my brother is a hairy man and I am a smooth [skinned] man. 
GEN.27.12	Suppose my father touches me 
GEN.27.13	But his mother said to him, “May your curse be on me, my son; only listen 
GEN.27.14	So Jacob went and got the two young goats, and brought them to his mother; and his mother prepared a delicious 
GEN.27.15	Then Rebekah took her elder son Esau’s best clothes, which were with her in her house, and put them on Jacob her younger son. 
GEN.27.16	And she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck. 
GEN.27.17	Then she gave her son Jacob the delicious meat and the bread which she had prepared.
GEN.27.18	So he went to his father and said, “My father.” And Isaac said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?” 
GEN.27.19	Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn; I have done what you told me to do. Now please, sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may bless me.” 
GEN.27.20	Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have found the game so quickly, my son?” And he said, “Because the L
GEN.27.21	But Isaac [wondered and] said to Jacob, “Please come close [to me] so that I may touch you, my son, 
GEN.27.22	So Jacob approached Isaac, and his father touched him and said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.” 
GEN.27.23	He could not recognize him [as Jacob], because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau’s hands; so he blessed him. 
GEN.27.24	But he said, “Are you really my son Esau?” Jacob answered, “I am.” 
GEN.27.25	Then Isaac said, “Bring the food to me, and I will eat some of my son’s game, so that I may bless you.” He brought it to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine and he drank. 
GEN.27.26	Then his father Isaac said to him, “Please come, my son, and kiss me.” 
GEN.27.27	So he came and kissed him; and Isaac smelled his clothing and blessed him and said,
GEN.27.27	“The scent of my son [Esau]
GEN.27.27	Is like the aroma of a field which the L
GEN.27.28	Now may God give you of the dew of heaven [to water your land],
GEN.27.28	And of the fatness (fertility) of the earth,
GEN.27.28	And an abundance of grain and 
GEN.27.29	May peoples serve you,
GEN.27.29	And nations bow down to you;
GEN.27.29	Be lord 
GEN.27.29	And may your mother’s sons bow down to you.
GEN.27.29	May those who curse you be cursed,
GEN.27.29	And may those who bless you be blessed.”
GEN.27.30	Now as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had scarcely left the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 
GEN.27.31	Esau also made a delicious dish [of meat] and brought it to his father and said to him, “Let my father get up and eat some of his son’s game, so that you may bless me.” 
GEN.27.32	Isaac his father said to him, “Who are you?” And he replied, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.” 
GEN.27.33	Then Isaac trembled violently, and he said, “Then who was the one [who was just here] who hunted game and brought it to me? I ate all of it before you came, and I blessed him. Yes, and he [in fact] shall be (shall remain) blessed.” 
GEN.27.34	When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with a great and extremely bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me, even me also, O my father!” 
GEN.27.35	Isaac said, “Your brother came deceitfully and has [fraudulently] taken away your blessing [for himself].” 
GEN.27.36	Esau replied, “Is he not rightly named 
GEN.27.37	But Isaac replied to Esau, “Listen carefully: I have made Jacob your lord 
GEN.27.38	Esau said to his father, “Have you only one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father.” Then Esau [no longer able to restrain himself] raised his voice and wept [loudly].
GEN.27.39	Then Isaac his father answered and [prophesied and] said to him,
GEN.27.39	“Your dwelling shall be away from the fertility of the earth
GEN.27.39	And away from the dew of heaven above;
GEN.27.40	But you shall live by your sword,
GEN.27.40	And serve your brother;
GEN.27.40	However it shall come to pass when you break loose [from your anger and hatred],
GEN.27.40	That you will tear his yoke off your neck [and you will be free of him].”
GEN.27.41	So Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him; and Esau said in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father are very near; then I will kill my brother Jacob.” 
GEN.27.42	When these words of her elder son Esau were repeated to Rebekah, she sent for Jacob her younger son, and said to him, “Listen carefully, your brother Esau is comforting himself concerning you 
GEN.27.43	So now, my son, listen 
GEN.27.44	Stay with him for a while, until your brother’s anger subsides. 
GEN.27.45	When your brother’s anger toward you subsides and he forgets what you did to him, then 
GEN.27.46	Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am tired of living because of the daughters of Heth [these insolent wives of Esau]. If Jacob takes a wife from the daughters of Heth, like these daughters of the land, what good will my life be to me?”
GEN.28.1	So Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and charged him, and said to him, “You shall not marry one of the women of Canaan. 
GEN.28.2	Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother’s father; and take from there as a wife for yourself one of the daughters of Laban your mother’s brother. 
GEN.28.3	May 
GEN.28.4	May He also give the blessing of Abraham to you and your descendants with you, that you may inherit the [promised] land of your sojournings, which He gave to Abraham.” 
GEN.28.5	Then Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.
GEN.28.6	Now Esau noticed that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him to Paddan-aram to take a wife for himself from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a prohibition, saying, “You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan,” 
GEN.28.7	and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Paddan-aram. 
GEN.28.8	So Esau realized that [his two wives] the daughters of Canaan displeased Isaac his father; 
GEN.28.9	and [to appease his parents] Esau went to [the family of] Ishmael and took as his wife, in addition to the wives he [already] had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebaioth [Ishmael’s firstborn son].
GEN.28.10	Now Jacob left Beersheba [never to see his mother again] and traveled toward Haran. 
GEN.28.11	And he came to a certain place and stayed overnight there because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down there [to sleep]. 
GEN.28.12	He dreamed that there was a ladder (stairway) placed on the earth, and the top of it reached [out of sight] toward heaven; and [he saw] the angels of God ascending and descending on it [going to and from heaven]. 
GEN.28.13	And behold, the L
GEN.28.14	Your descendants shall be as [countless as] the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and the east and the north and the south; and all the families (nations) of the earth shall be blessed through you and your 
GEN.28.15	Behold, I am with you and will keep [careful watch over you and guard] you wherever you may go, and I will bring you back to this [promised] land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” 
GEN.28.16	Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and he said, “Without any doubt the L
GEN.28.17	So he was afraid and said, “How fearful 
GEN.28.18	So Jacob got up early in the morning, and took the stone he had put under his head and he set it up as a pillar [that is, a monument to the vision in his dream], and he poured [olive] oil on the top of it [to 
GEN.28.19	He named that place Bethel (the house of God); the previous name of that city was Luz (Almond Tree). 
GEN.28.20	Then Jacob made a vow (promise), saying, “If God will be with me and will keep me on this journey that I take, and will give me food to eat and clothing to wear, 
GEN.28.21	and if [He grants that] I return to my father’s house in safety, then the L
GEN.28.22	This stone which I have set up as a pillar (monument, memorial) will be God’s house [a sacred place to me], and of everything that You give me I will give the tenth to You [as an offering to signify my gratitude and dependence on You].”
GEN.29.1	Then Jacob 
GEN.29.2	As he looked, he saw a well in the field, and three flocks of sheep lying there [resting] beside it because the flocks were watered from that well. Now the stone on the mouth of the well [that covered and protected it] was large, 
GEN.29.3	and when all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone from the mouth of the well, water the sheep, and [afterward] replace the stone on the mouth of the well.
GEN.29.4	Jacob said to them, “My brothers, where are you from?” And they said, “We are from Haran.” 
GEN.29.5	So he said to them, “Do you know Laban the grandson of Nahor [Abraham’s brother]?” And they replied, “We know him.” 
GEN.29.6	And he asked them, “
GEN.29.7	Jacob said, “Look, the sun is still high [overhead]; it is a long time before the flocks need to be gathered [in their folds for the night]. Water the sheep, and go, and return them to their pasture.” 
GEN.29.8	But they said, “We cannot [leave] until all the flocks are gathered together, and the shepherds roll the stone from the mouth of the well; then we will water the sheep.”
GEN.29.9	While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherdess. 
GEN.29.10	When Jacob saw [his cousin] Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother, and Laban’s sheep, he came up and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered the flock of Laban, his uncle. 
GEN.29.11	Then Jacob kissed Rachel [in greeting], and he raised his voice and wept. 
GEN.29.12	Jacob told Rachel he was her father’s relative, Rebekah’s son; and she ran and told her father.
GEN.29.13	When Laban heard of the arrival of Jacob, his sister’s son, he ran to meet him, and embraced and kissed him and brought him to his house. Then he told Laban all these things. 
GEN.29.14	Then Laban said to him, “You are my bone and my flesh.” And Jacob stayed with him a month.
GEN.29.15	Then Laban said to Jacob, “Just because you are my relative, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me, what should your wages be?” 
GEN.29.16	Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 
GEN.29.17	Leah’s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance. 
GEN.29.18	Jacob loved Rachel, so he said, “I will serve you [as a hired workman] for seven years [in return] for [the privilege of marrying] Rachel your younger daughter.” 
GEN.29.19	Laban said, “It is better that I give her [in marriage] to you than give her to another man. Stay 
GEN.29.20	So Jacob served [Laban] for seven years for [the right to marry] Rachel, but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her.
GEN.29.21	Finally, Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my time [of service] is completed, so that I may take her to me [as my wife].” 
GEN.29.22	So Laban gathered together all the men of the place and prepared a [wedding] 
GEN.29.23	But in the evening he took Leah his daughter and brought her to Jacob, and Jacob 
GEN.29.24	Laban also gave Zilpah his maid to his daughter Leah as a maid. 
GEN.29.25	But in the morning [when Jacob awoke], it was Leah [who was with him]! And he said to Laban, “What is this that you have done to me? Did I not work for you [for seven years] for Rachel? Why have you deceived 
GEN.29.26	But Laban only said, “It is not 
GEN.29.27	Finish the week [of the wedding feast] for Leah; then we will give you Rachel also, and in return you shall work for me for seven more years.” 
GEN.29.28	So Jacob complied and fulfilled Leah’s week [of celebration]; then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as his [second] wife. 
GEN.29.29	Laban also gave Bilhah his maid to his daughter Rachel as a maid. 
GEN.29.30	So Jacob consummated his marriage 
GEN.29.31	Now when the L
GEN.29.32	Leah conceived and gave birth to a son and named him Reuben (See, a son!), for she said, “Because the L
GEN.29.33	Then she conceived again and gave birth to a son and said, “Because the L
GEN.29.34	She conceived again and gave birth to a son and said, “Now this time my husband will become attached to me [as a companion], for I have given him three sons.” Therefore he was named 
GEN.29.35	Again she conceived and gave birth to a [fourth] son, and she said, “Now I will praise the L
GEN.30.1	When Rachel saw that she conceived no children for Jacob, she envied her sister, and said to Jacob, “Give me children, or else I will die.” 
GEN.30.2	Then Jacob became furious with Rachel, and he said, “Am I in the place of God, who has denied you children?” 
GEN.30.3	She said, “Here, take my maid Bilhah and go in to her; and [when the baby comes] she shall 
GEN.30.4	So she gave him Bilhah her maid as a [
GEN.30.5	Bilhah conceived and gave birth to a son for Jacob. 
GEN.30.6	Then Rachel said, “God has judged 
GEN.30.7	Bilhah, Rachel’s maid, conceived again and gave birth to a second son for Jacob. 
GEN.30.8	So Rachel said, “With mighty wrestlings [in prayer to God] I have struggled with my sister and have prevailed.” So she named him Naphtali (my wrestlings).
GEN.30.9	When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing [children], she took Zilpah her maid and gave her to Jacob as a [
GEN.30.10	Zilpah, Leah’s maid, gave birth to a son for Jacob. 
GEN.30.11	Then Leah said, “How fortunate!” So she named him Gad (good fortune). 
GEN.30.12	Zilpah, Leah’s maid, gave birth to a second son for Jacob. 
GEN.30.13	Then Leah said, “I am happy! For women will call me happy.” So she named him Asher (happy).
GEN.30.14	Now at the time of wheat harvest Reuben [the eldest child] went and found some 
GEN.30.15	But Leah answered, “Is it a small thing that you have taken my husband? Would you take away my son’s mandrakes also?” So Rachel said, “Jacob shall sleep with you tonight in exchange for your son’s mandrakes.” 
GEN.30.16	When Jacob came in from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must sleep with me [tonight], for I have in fact hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he slept with her that night. 
GEN.30.17	God listened 
GEN.30.18	Then Leah said, “God has given me my reward because I have given my maid to my husband.” So she named him 
GEN.30.19	Leah conceived again and gave birth to a sixth son for Jacob. 
GEN.30.20	Then Leah said, “God has endowed me with a good [marriage] gift [for my husband]; now he will live with me [regarding me with honor as his wife], because I have given birth to six sons.” So she named him 
GEN.30.21	Afterward she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.
GEN.30.22	Then God remembered [the prayers of] Rachel, and God thought of her and opened her womb [so that she would conceive]. 
GEN.30.23	So she conceived and gave birth to a son; and she said, “God has taken away my disgrace 
GEN.30.24	She named him Joseph (may He add) and said, “May the L
GEN.30.25	Now when Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away, that I may go back to my own place and to my own country. 
GEN.30.26	Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know the work which I have done for you.” 
GEN.30.27	But Laban said to him, “If I have found favor in your sight, 
GEN.30.28	He said, “Name your wages, and I will give it [to you].” 
GEN.30.29	Jacob answered him, “You know how I have served you and how your possessions, your cattle 
GEN.30.30	For you had little before I came and it has increased 
GEN.30.31	Laban asked, “What shall I give you?” Jacob replied, “You shall not give me anything. But if you will do this one thing for me [which I now propose], I will again pasture and keep your flock: 
GEN.30.32	Let me pass through your entire flock today, removing from it every speckled and spotted sheep and every dark 
GEN.30.33	So my honesty will be evident for me later, when you come [for an accounting] concerning my wages. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and dark among the young lambs, 
GEN.30.34	And Laban said, “Good! Let it be done as you say.” 
GEN.30.35	So on that same day Laban [secretly] removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one with white on it, and all the dark ones among the sheep, and put them in the care of his sons. 
GEN.30.36	And he put [a distance of] three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob was then left in care of the rest of Laban’s flock.
GEN.30.37	Then Jacob took branches of fresh poplar and almond and plane trees, and peeled white stripes in them, exposing the white in the branches. 
GEN.30.38	Then he set the branches which he had peeled in front of the flocks in the watering troughs, where the flocks came to drink; and they mated 
GEN.30.39	So the flocks mated 
GEN.30.40	Jacob separated the lambs, and [as he had done with the peeled branches] he made the flocks face toward the streaked and all the dark 
GEN.30.41	Furthermore, whenever the stronger [animals] of the flocks were breeding, Jacob would place the branches in the sight of the flock in the watering troughs, so that they would mate 
GEN.30.42	but when the flock was sickly, he did not put 
GEN.30.43	So Jacob became exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks [of sheep and goats], and female and male servants, and camels and donkeys.
GEN.31.1	Jacob heard that Laban’s sons were saying: “Jacob has taken away everything that was our father’s, and from what belonged to our father he has acquired all this wealth 
GEN.31.2	Jacob noticed [a change in] the 
GEN.31.3	Then the L
GEN.31.4	So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to his flock in the field, 
GEN.31.5	and he said to them, “I see [a change in] your father’s attitude, that he is not 
GEN.31.6	You know that I have served your father with all my strength. 
GEN.31.7	Yet your father has cheated me [as often as possible] and changed my wages ten times; but God did not allow him to hurt me. 
GEN.31.8	If he said, ‘The speckled shall be your wages,’ then the entire flock gave birth to speckled [young]; and if he said, ‘The streaked shall be your wages,’ then the entire flock gave birth to streaked [young]. 
GEN.31.9	Thus God has taken away the flocks of your father and given them to me. 
GEN.31.10	And it happened at the time when the flock conceived that I looked up and saw in a dream that the rams which mated [with the female goats] were streaked, speckled, and spotted. 
GEN.31.11	And the 
GEN.31.12	He said, ‘Look up and see, all the rams which are mating [with the flock] are streaked, speckled, and spotted; for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you. 
GEN.31.13	I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar, and where you made a vow to Me; now stand up, leave this land, and return to the land of your birth.’ ” 
GEN.31.14	Rachel and Leah answered him, “Is there still any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house? 
GEN.31.15	Are we not counted by him as foreigners? For he sold us [to you in marriage], and has also entirely used up our purchase price. 
GEN.31.16	Surely all the riches which God has taken from our father are ours and our children’s. Now then, whatever God has told you to do, do it.”
GEN.31.17	Then Jacob stood [and took action] and put his children and his wives on camels; 
GEN.31.18	and he drove away all his livestock and [took along] all his property which he had acquired, the livestock he had obtained and accumulated in Paddan-aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.31.19	When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel [went inside the house and] stole her father’s 
GEN.31.20	And Jacob 
GEN.31.21	So he fled with everything that he had, and got up and crossed the river [Euphrates], and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead [east of the Jordan River].
GEN.31.22	On the third day [after his departure] Laban was told that Jacob had fled. 
GEN.31.23	So he took his relatives with him and pursued him for seven days, and they overtook him in the hill country of Gilead. 
GEN.31.24	God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, “Be careful that you do not speak to Jacob, either good or bad.”
GEN.31.25	Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent on the hill, and Laban with his relatives camped on the same hill of Gilead. 
GEN.31.26	Then Laban said to Jacob, “What do you mean by deceiving me 
GEN.31.27	Why did you run away secretly and deceive me and not tell me, so that [otherwise] I might have sent you away with joy and with songs, with [music on the] tambourine and lyre? 
GEN.31.28	And why did you not allow me to kiss my 
GEN.31.29	It is in my power to harm you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, ‘Be careful not to speak to Jacob, either good or bad.’ 
GEN.31.30	Now [I suppose] you felt you must go because you 
GEN.31.31	Jacob answered Laban, “[I left secretly] because I was afraid, for I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force. 
GEN.31.32	The one with whom you find your gods shall not live; in the presence of our relatives [search my possessions and] point out whatever you find that belongs to you and take it.” For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the idols.
GEN.31.33	So Laban went into Jacob’s tent and into Leah’s tent and the tent of the two maids, but he did not find them. Then he came out of Leah’s tent and entered Rachel’s tent. 
GEN.31.34	Now Rachel had taken the household idols and put them in the camel’s saddlebag and sat on them. Laban searched through all her tent, but did not find them. 
GEN.31.35	So Rachel said to her father, “Do not be displeased, my lord, that I cannot rise before you, for the manner of women is on me 
GEN.31.36	Then Jacob became angry and argued with Laban. And he said to Laban, “What is my fault? What is my sin that you pursued me like this? 
GEN.31.37	Although you have searched through all my possessions, what have you found of your household goods? Put it here before my relatives and your relatives, so that they may decide [who has done right] between the two of us. 
GEN.31.38	These twenty years I 
GEN.31.39	I did not bring you the torn carcasses [of the animals attacked by predators]; I [personally] took the loss. You required of me [to make good] everything that was stolen, whether it occurred by day or night. 
GEN.31.40	This was my situation: by day the heat consumed me and by night the cold, and 
GEN.31.41	These twenty years I have been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for [my share of] your flocks, and you have 
GEN.31.42	If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and [the Feared One] of Isaac, had not been with me, most certainly you would have sent me away now empty-handed. God has seen my affliction 
GEN.31.43	Laban answered Jacob, “These 
GEN.31.44	So come now, let us make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between you and me.” 
GEN.31.45	So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a [memorial] pillar. 
GEN.31.46	Jacob said to his relatives, “Gather stones.” And they took stones and made a mound [of stones], and they ate [a ceremonial meal together] there on the mound [of stones]. 
GEN.31.47	Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha (stone monument of testimony in 
GEN.31.48	Laban said, “This mound [of stones] is a witness [a reminder of the oath taken] today between you and me.” Therefore he [also] called the name Galeed, 
GEN.31.49	and Mizpah (
GEN.31.50	If you should mistreat (humiliate, oppress) my daughters, or if you should take other wives besides my daughters, although no one is with us [as a witness], see 
GEN.31.51	Laban said to Jacob, “Look at this mound [of stones] and look at this pillar which I have set up between you and me. 
GEN.31.52	This mound is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not pass by this mound to harm you, and that you will not pass by this mound and this pillar to harm me. 
GEN.31.53	The God of Abraham [your father] and the God of Nahor [my father], and the 
GEN.31.54	Then Jacob offered a sacrifice [to the L
GEN.31.55	Early in the morning Laban got up and kissed his 
GEN.32.1	Then as Jacob went on his way, the angels of God met him [to reassure and protect him]. 
GEN.32.2	When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is God’s camp.” So he named that place Mahanaim (
GEN.32.3	Then Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom. 
GEN.32.4	He commanded them, saying, “This is what to say to my lord Esau: ‘Your servant Jacob says this, “I have been living temporarily with Laban, and have stayed there until now; 
GEN.32.5	I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants; and I have sent [this message] to tell my lord, so that I may find grace 
GEN.32.6	The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and there are four hundred men with him.” 
GEN.32.7	Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two camps; 
GEN.32.8	and he said, “If Esau comes to the one camp and attacks it, then the other camp which is left will escape.”
GEN.32.9	Jacob said, “O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, the L
GEN.32.10	I am unworthy of all the lovingkindness 
GEN.32.11	Save me, please, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, that he will come and attack me and the mothers with the children. 
GEN.32.12	And You [L
GEN.32.13	So Jacob spent the night there. Then he selected a present for his brother Esau from the livestock he had acquired: 
GEN.32.14	two hundred female goats, twenty male goats, two hundred ewes, twenty rams, 
GEN.32.15	thirty milking camels with their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys, and ten [donkey] colts. 
GEN.32.16	He put them into the care of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Go on ahead of me, and put an interval [of space] between the 
GEN.32.17	Then he commanded the one in front, saying, “When Esau my brother meets you and asks to whom you belong, and where you are going, and whose are the 
GEN.32.18	then you shall say, ‘They are your servant Jacob’s; they are a gift sent to my lord Esau. And he also is behind us.’ ” 
GEN.32.19	And so Jacob commanded the second and the third as well, and all that followed the herds, saying, “This is what you shall say to Esau when you meet him; 
GEN.32.20	and you shall say, ‘Look, your servant Jacob is behind us.’ ” For he said [to himself], “I will try to appease him with the gift that is going ahead of me. Then afterward I will see him; perhaps he will accept 
GEN.32.21	So the gift [of the herds of livestock] went on ahead of him, and he himself spent that night back in the camp.
GEN.32.22	But he got up that same night and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven children, and waded over the ford of the Jabbok. 
GEN.32.23	Then he took them and sent them across the brook. And he also sent across whatever he had.
GEN.32.24	So Jacob was left alone, and a 
GEN.32.25	When the Man saw that He had not prevailed against Jacob, He touched his hip joint; and Jacob’s hip was dislocated as he wrestled with Him. 
GEN.32.26	Then He said, “Let Me go, for day is breaking.” But Jacob said, “I will not let You go unless You declare a blessing on me.” 
GEN.32.27	So He asked him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Jacob.” 
GEN.32.28	And He said, “Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but 
GEN.32.29	Then Jacob asked Him, “Please tell me Your name.” But He said, “Why is it that you ask My name?” And He declared a blessing [of the covenant promises] on Jacob there. 
GEN.32.30	So Jacob named the place Peniel (the face of God), 
GEN.32.31	Now the sun rose on him as he passed Penuel (Peniel), and he was limping because of his hip. 
GEN.32.32	Therefore, to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon of the hip which is on the socket of the thigh, because He touched the socket of Jacob’s thigh by the tendon of the hip.
GEN.33.1	Then Jacob looked up, and saw Esau coming with four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two maids. 
GEN.33.2	He put the maids and their children in front, Leah and her children after them, and Rachel and Joseph last of all. 
GEN.33.3	Then Jacob crossed over [the stream] ahead of them and bowed himself to the ground seven times [bowing and moving forward each time], until he approached his brother.
GEN.33.4	But Esau ran to meet him and embraced him, and hugged his neck and kissed him, and they wept [for joy]. 
GEN.33.5	Esau looked up and saw the women and the children, and said, “Who are these with you?” So Jacob replied, “They are the children whom God has graciously given your servant.” 
GEN.33.6	Then the maids approached with their children, and they bowed down. 
GEN.33.7	Leah also approached with her children, and they bowed down. Afterward Joseph and Rachel approached, and they bowed down. 
GEN.33.8	Esau asked, “What do you mean by all this company which I have met?” And he answered, “[These are] to find favor in the sight of my lord.” 
GEN.33.9	But Esau said, “I have plenty, my brother; keep what you have for yourself.” 
GEN.33.10	Jacob replied, “No, please, if now I have found favor in your sight, then accept my gift [as a blessing] from my hand, for I see your face as if I had seen the face of God, and you have received me favorably. 
GEN.33.11	Please accept my blessing (gift) which has been brought to you, for God has dealt graciously with me and I have everything [that I could possibly want].” So Jacob kept urging him and Esau accepted it.
GEN.33.12	Then Esau said, “Let us get started on our journey and I will go in front of you [to lead the way].” 
GEN.33.13	But Jacob replied, “You know, my lord, that the children are frail 
GEN.33.14	Please let my lord go on ahead of his servant, and I will move on slowly, governed by the pace of the livestock that are in front of me and according to the endurance of the children, 
GEN.33.15	Then Esau said, “Please let me leave with you some of the people who are with me.” But Jacob said, “
GEN.33.16	So Esau turned back [toward the south] that day on his way to Seir. 
GEN.33.17	But Jacob journeyed [north] to Succoth, and built himself a house and made shelters for his livestock; so the name of the place is Succoth (huts, shelters).
GEN.33.18	When Jacob came from Paddan-aram, he arrived safely 
GEN.33.19	Then he bought the piece of land on which he had pitched his tents from 
GEN.33.20	There he erected an altar and called it 
GEN.34.1	Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out [unescorted] to visit the girls of the land. 
GEN.34.2	When Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince (sheik) of the land, saw her, he kidnapped her and lay [intimately] with her by force [humbling and offending her]. 
GEN.34.3	But his soul longed for and clung to Dinah daughter of Jacob, and he loved the girl and spoke comfortingly to her young heart’s wishes. 
GEN.34.4	So Shechem said to his father Hamor, “Get me this young woman as a wife.” 
GEN.34.5	Now Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled (violated) Dinah his daughter; but his sons were in the field with his livestock, so Jacob said nothing until they came in. 
GEN.34.6	But Shechem’s father Hamor went to Jacob to talk with him. 
GEN.34.7	Now when Jacob’s sons heard of it they came in from the field; they were deeply grieved, and they were very angry, for Shechem had done a disgraceful thing to 
GEN.34.8	But Hamor conferred with them, saying, “The soul of my son Shechem [deeply] longs for your daughter [and sister]. Please give her to him as his wife. 
GEN.34.9	And [beyond that] intermarry with us; give your daughters to us [as wives] and take our daughters for yourselves. 
GEN.34.10	In this way you shall live with us; the country will be open to you; live and do business in it and acquire property 
GEN.34.11	Shechem also said to Dinah’s father and to her brothers, “Let me find favor in your sight, and I will give you whatever you ask of me. 
GEN.34.12	Demand of me a very large bridal payment and gift [as compensation for giving up your daughter and sister], and I will give you whatever you tell me; only give me the girl to be my wife.”
GEN.34.13	Jacob’s sons answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, because Shechem had defiled 
GEN.34.14	They said to them, “We cannot do this thing and give our sister [in marriage] to one who is not circumcised, because that would be a disgrace to us. 
GEN.34.15	But we will consent to you only on this 
GEN.34.16	then we will give our daughters to you [in marriage], and we will take your daughters for ourselves, and we will live with you and become one people. 
GEN.34.17	But if you do not listen to us 
GEN.34.18	Their words seemed reasonable to Hamor and his son Shechem, 
GEN.34.19	and the young man did not hesitate to do the [required] thing, for he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter. Now he was more respected 
GEN.34.20	Then Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their [walled] city [where the leading men would meet] and spoke with the men of the city, saying, 
GEN.34.21	“These men are peaceful 
GEN.34.22	But only on this 
GEN.34.23	Will not their cattle and their possessions and all their animals be ours [if we do this]? Let us consent [to do as they ask], and they will live here with us.” 
GEN.34.24	And every [Canaanite] man who went out of the city gate listened 
GEN.34.25	Now on the third day [after the circumcision], when all the men were [terribly] sore 
GEN.34.26	They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house [where she was staying], and left. 
GEN.34.27	Then Jacob’s [other] sons came upon those who were killed and looted the town, because their sister had been defiled 
GEN.34.28	They took the Canaanites’ flocks and their herds and their donkeys, and whatever was in the city and in the field; 
GEN.34.29	they looted all their wealth, and [took captive] all their children and their wives, even everything that was in the houses. 
GEN.34.30	Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have ruined me, making me a stench to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites! My men are few in number, and the men of the land will band together against me and attack me; I shall be destroyed, I and my household.” 
GEN.34.31	But they said, “Should he [be permitted to] treat our sister as a prostitute?”
GEN.35.1	Then God said to Jacob, “Go up to Bethel and live there, and make an altar there to God, who appeared to you [in a distinct manifestation] when you fled [years ago] from Esau your brother.” 
GEN.35.2	Then Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Get rid of the [idols and images of] foreign gods that are among you, and ceremonially purify yourselves and change [into fresh] clothes; 
GEN.35.3	then let us get up and go up to Bethel, and I will make an altar there to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone.” 
GEN.35.4	So they gave Jacob all the [idols and images of the] foreign gods they had and the rings which were in their ears [worn as charms against evil], and Jacob buried them under the 
GEN.35.5	As they journeyed, there was a great [supernatural] terror [sent from God] on the cities around them, and [for that reason] the Canaanites did not pursue the sons of Jacob. 
GEN.35.6	So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him. 
GEN.35.7	There he built an altar [to worship the L
GEN.35.8	Now Deborah, [who once was] Rebekah’s nurse, died and was buried below Bethel under the oak; and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth (Oak of Weeping).
GEN.35.9	Then God [in a visible manifestation] appeared to Jacob again when he came out of Paddan-aram, and declared a blessing on him. 
GEN.35.10	Again God said to him,
GEN.35.10	“Your name is Jacob;
GEN.35.10	You shall no longer be called Jacob,
GEN.35.10	But Israel shall be your name.”
GEN.35.10	So he was called 
GEN.35.11	And God said to him,
GEN.35.11	“I am 
GEN.35.11	Be fruitful and multiply;
GEN.35.11	A nation and a company of nations shall come from you,
GEN.35.11	And kings shall be born of your 
GEN.35.12	The land which I gave Abraham and Isaac
GEN.35.12	I will give to you,
GEN.35.12	and to your descendants after you I will give the land.”
GEN.35.13	Then God ascended from Jacob in the place where He had spoken with him. 
GEN.35.14	Jacob set up a pillar (memorial, monument) in the place where he had talked with God, a pillar of stone, and he poured a drink offering [of wine] on it; he also poured oil on it [to declare it sacred for God’s purpose]. 
GEN.35.15	So Jacob named the place where God had spoken with him, Bethel (the House of God).
GEN.35.16	Then they journeyed from Bethel; and when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath (Bethlehem), Rachel began to give birth and had difficulty 
GEN.35.17	When she was in hard labor the midwife said to her, “Do not be afraid; you now have another son.” 
GEN.35.18	And as her soul was departing, (for she died), she named him Ben-oni (son of my sorrow); but his father called him Benjamin (
GEN.35.19	So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). 
GEN.35.20	Jacob set a pillar (memorial, monument) on her grave; that is the 
GEN.35.21	Then Israel (Jacob) journeyed on and pitched his tent on the other side of the tower of Eder [the lookout point used by shepherds].
GEN.35.22	While Israel was living in that land, Reuben [his eldest son] went and lay with Bilhah his father’s 
GEN.35.23	The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, then Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun; 
GEN.35.24	and the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin; 
GEN.35.25	and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s maid: Dan and Naphtali; 
GEN.35.26	and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s maid: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob born to him in Paddan-aram.
GEN.35.27	Jacob came to Isaac his father at Mamre of Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had lived temporarily.
GEN.35.28	Now the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years. 
GEN.35.29	Isaac’s spirit departed and he died and was 
GEN.36.1	Now these are 
GEN.36.2	Esau took his [three] wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the son of Zibeon the Hivite, 
GEN.36.3	and Basemath, Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebaioth. 
GEN.36.4	Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, and Basemath bore Reuel, 
GEN.36.5	and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau born to him in Canaan.
GEN.36.6	Now Esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters and all the members of his household, and his livestock and all his cattle and all his possessions which he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and he went to a land away from his brother Jacob. 
GEN.36.7	For their [great flocks and herds and] possessions made it impossible for them to live together [in the same region]; the land in which they lived temporarily could not support them because of their livestock. 
GEN.36.8	So Esau lived in the hill country of Seir; Esau is Edom.
GEN.36.9	These are 
GEN.36.10	These are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz, the son of Adah, Esau’s wife, and Reuel, the son of Basemath, Esau’s wife. 
GEN.36.11	And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz. 
GEN.36.12	And Timna was a 
GEN.36.13	These are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These are the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife. 
GEN.36.14	And these are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau’s wife, the daughter of Anah, the son of Zibeon. She bore to Esau: Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.
GEN.36.15	These are the 
GEN.36.16	Korah, Gatam, and Amalek. These are the chiefs of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; they are the sons of Adah. 
GEN.36.17	These are the sons of Reuel, Esau’s son: Chiefs Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, Mizzah. These are the chiefs of Reuel in the land of Edom; they are the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife. 
GEN.36.18	These are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau’s wife: Chiefs Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the chiefs born of Oholibamah, daughter of Anah, Esau’s wife. 
GEN.36.19	These are the sons of Esau, (that is, Edom), and these are their chiefs.
GEN.36.20	These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 
GEN.36.21	Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These are the chiefs of the Horites, the sons of Seir in the land of Edom. 
GEN.36.22	The sons of Lotan are Hori and Hemam; and Lotan’s sister is Timna. 
GEN.36.23	The sons of Shobal are these: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. 
GEN.36.24	These are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah. This is the Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness as he pastured the donkeys of Zibeon his father. 
GEN.36.25	The children of Anah are these: Dishon and Oholibamah [Esau’s wife], the daughter of Anah. 
GEN.36.26	These are the sons of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran. 
GEN.36.27	Ezer’s sons are these: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan. 
GEN.36.28	The sons of Dishan are these: Uz and Aran. 
GEN.36.29	The Horite chiefs are these: Chiefs Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 
GEN.36.30	Dishon, Ezer, Dishan. These are the Horite chiefs, according to their various clans in the land of Seir.
GEN.36.31	And these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the Israelites: 
GEN.36.32	Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his city was Dinhabah. 
GEN.36.33	Now Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned as his successor. 
GEN.36.34	Then Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned as his successor. 
GEN.36.35	And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the country of Moab, reigned as his successor. The name of his [walled] city was Avith. 
GEN.36.36	Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah succeeded him. 
GEN.36.37	Then Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth on the river [Euphrates] reigned as his successor. 
GEN.36.38	And Shaul died, and Baal-hanan son of Achbor reigned as his successor. 
GEN.36.39	Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and then 
GEN.36.40	And these are the names of the 
GEN.36.41	Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon, 
GEN.36.42	Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar, 
GEN.36.43	Magdiel, and Iram. These are the 
GEN.37.1	So Jacob (Israel) lived in the land 
GEN.37.2	These are the generations of Jacob.
GEN.37.3	Now Israel (Jacob) loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a [distinctive] 
GEN.37.4	His brothers saw that their father loved Joseph more than all of his brothers; so they hated him and could not [find it within themselves to] speak to him on friendly terms.
GEN.37.5	Now Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers, and they 
GEN.37.6	He said to them, “Please listen to [the details of] this dream which I have dreamed; 
GEN.37.7	we [brothers] were binding sheaves [of grain stalks] in the field, and lo, my sheaf [suddenly] got up and stood upright 
GEN.37.8	His brothers said to him, “Are you actually going to reign over us? Are you really going to rule 
GEN.37.9	But Joseph dreamed still another dream, and told it to his brothers [as well]. He said, “See here, I have again dreamed a dream, and lo, [this time I saw] eleven stars and the sun and the moon bowed down [in respect] to me!” 
GEN.37.10	He told it to his father as well as to his brothers; but his father rebuked him and said to him [in disbelief], “What is [the meaning of] this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers actually come to bow down to the ground [in respect] before you?” 
GEN.37.11	Joseph’s brothers were envious 
GEN.37.12	Then his brothers went to pasture their father’s flock near Shechem. 
GEN.37.13	Israel (Jacob) said to Joseph, “Are not your brothers pasturing [the flock] at Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them.” And he said, “Here I am [ready to obey you].” 
GEN.37.14	Then Jacob said to him, “Please go and see whether everything is all right with your brothers and all right with the flock; then bring word [back] to me.” So he sent him from the Hebron Valley, and he went to Shechem.
GEN.37.15	Now a certain man found Joseph, and saw that he was wandering around 
GEN.37.16	He said, “I am looking for my brothers. Please tell me where they are pasturing 
GEN.37.17	Then the man said, “[They were here, but] they have moved on from this place. I heard them say, ‘Let us go to 
GEN.37.18	And when they saw him from a distance, even before he came close to them, they plotted to kill him. 
GEN.37.19	They said to one another, “Look, here comes this 
GEN.37.20	Now then, come and let us kill him and throw him into one of the 
GEN.37.21	Now Reuben [the eldest] heard this and rescued him from their hands and said, “Let us not take his life.” 
GEN.37.22	Reuben said to them, “Do not shed his blood, but [instead] throw him [alive] into the pit that is here in the wilderness, and do not lay a hand on him [to kill him]”—[he said this so] that he could rescue him from them and return him [safely] to his father. 
GEN.37.23	Now when Joseph reached his brothers, they stripped him of his tunic, the [distinctive] 
GEN.37.24	then they took him and threw him into the pit. Now the pit was empty; there was no water in it.
GEN.37.25	Then they sat down to eat their meal. When they looked up, they saw a caravan of 
GEN.37.26	Judah said to his brothers, “What do we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood (murder)? 
GEN.37.27	Come, let us [instead] sell him to these Ishmaelites [and 
GEN.37.28	Then as the 
GEN.37.29	Now Reuben [unaware of what had happened] returned to the pit, and [to his great alarm found that] Joseph was not in the pit; so he tore his clothes [in deep sorrow]. 
GEN.37.30	He rejoined his brothers and said, “The boy is not there; as for me, where shall I go [to hide from my father]?” 
GEN.37.31	Then they took Joseph’s tunic, slaughtered a male goat and dipped the tunic in the blood; 
GEN.37.32	and they brought the multicolored tunic to their father, saying, “We have found this; please examine it 
GEN.37.33	He recognized it and said, “It is my son’s tunic. A wild animal has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces!” 
GEN.37.34	So Jacob tore his clothes [in grief], put 
GEN.37.35	Then all his sons and daughters attempted to console him, but he refused to be comforted and said, “I will go down to Sheol (the place of the dead) in mourning for my son.” And his father wept for him. 
GEN.37.36	Meanwhile, in Egypt the Midianites sold Joseph [as a slave] to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and the captain of the [royal] guard.
GEN.38.1	Now at that time, Judah left his brothers and went down to [stay with] a certain Adullamite named Hirah. 
GEN.38.2	There Judah saw a daughter of Shua, a Canaanite, and he took her [as his wife] and lived with her. 
GEN.38.3	So she conceived and gave birth to a son and Judah named him Er. 
GEN.38.4	Then she conceived again and gave birth to a son and named him Onan. 
GEN.38.5	Again she conceived and gave birth to still another son and named him Shelah. It was at Chezib that she gave birth to him.
GEN.38.6	Now Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn; her name was Tamar. 
GEN.38.7	But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was evil in the sight of the L
GEN.38.8	Then Judah told Onan, “Go in to your brother’s widow, and perform your duty as a brother-in-law [under the levirate marriage custom]; [be her husband and] raise children for [the name of] your brother.” 
GEN.38.9	Onan knew that the child (heir) would not be his [but his dead brother’s]; so whenever he lay with his brother’s widow, he spilled his seed on the ground [to prevent conception], so that he would not give a child to his brother. 
GEN.38.10	But what he did was displeasing in the sight of the L
GEN.38.11	Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow at your father’s house until Shelah my [youngest] son is grown”; [but he was deceiving her] for he thought that [if Shelah should marry her] he too might die like his brothers did. So Tamar went and lived in her father’s house.
GEN.38.13	Tamar was told, “Listen, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.” 
GEN.38.14	So she removed her widow’s clothes and covered herself with a veil, and wrapped herself up [in disguise], and sat in the gateway of Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah had grown up, and she had not been given to him as a wife [as Judah had promised]. 
GEN.38.15	When Judah saw her, he thought she was a [temple] prostitute, for she had covered her face [as such women did]. 
GEN.38.16	He turned to her by the road, and said, “Please come, let me lie with you”; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, “What will you give me, that you may lie with me?” 
GEN.38.17	He answered, “I will send you a young goat from the flock.” And she said, “Will you give me a pledge [as a deposit] until you send it?” 
GEN.38.18	He said, “What pledge shall I give you?” She said, “Your seal and your cord, and the staff that is in your hand.” So he gave them to her and was intimate with her, and she conceived by him. 
GEN.38.19	Then she got up and left, and removed her veil and put on her widow’s clothing.
GEN.38.20	When Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite, to get his pledge [back] from the woman, he was unable to find her. 
GEN.38.21	He asked the men of that place, “Where is the temple prostitute who was by the roadside at Enaim?” They said, “There was no prostitute here.” 
GEN.38.22	So he returned to Judah, and said, “I cannot find her; also the local men said, ‘There was no prostitute around here.’ ” 
GEN.38.23	Then Judah said, “Let her keep the things (pledge articles) for herself, otherwise we will be a laughingstock [searching everywhere for her]. After all, I sent this young goat, but you did not find her.”
GEN.38.24	About three months later Judah was told, “Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the [role of a] prostitute, and she is with child because of her immorality.” So Judah said, “Bring her out and let her be burned [to death as punishment]!” 
GEN.38.25	While she was being brought out, she [took the things Judah had given her and] sent [them along with a message] to her father-in-law, saying, “I am with child by the man to whom these articles belong.” And she added, “Please examine [them carefully] and see [clearly] to whom these things belong, the seal and the cord and staff.” 
GEN.38.26	Judah recognized the articles, and said, “She has been more righteous [in this matter] than I, because I did not give her to my son Shelah [as I had promised].” And Judah did not have [intimate] relations with her again.
GEN.38.27	Now when the time came for her to give birth, there were twins in her womb. 
GEN.38.28	And when she was in labor, one [baby] put out his hand, and the midwife took his hand and tied a scarlet thread on it, saying, “This one was born first.” 
GEN.38.29	But he pulled back his hand, and his brother was born first. And she said, “What a breach you have made for yourself [to be the firstborn]!” So he was named Perez (breach, break forth). 
GEN.38.30	Afterward his brother who had the scarlet [thread] on his hand was born and was named Zerah (brightness).
GEN.39.1	Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an Egyptian officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the [royal] guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites, who had taken him down there. 
GEN.39.2	The L
GEN.39.3	Now his master saw that the L
GEN.39.4	So Joseph pleased Potiphar 
GEN.39.5	It happened that from the time that he made Joseph overseer in his house and [put him in charge] over all that he owned, that the L
GEN.39.6	So Potiphar left all that he owned in Joseph’s charge; and with Joseph there he did not [need to] 
GEN.39.7	Then after a time his master’s wife 
GEN.39.8	But he refused and said to his master’s wife, “Look, with me in the house, my master does not concern himself with anything; he has put everything that he owns in my charge. 
GEN.39.9	He is not greater in this house than I am, nor has he kept anything from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do this great evil and sin against God [and your husband]?” 
GEN.39.10	And so it was that she spoke to Joseph [persistently] day after day, but he did not listen to her [plea] to lie beside her or be with her. 
GEN.39.11	Then it happened one day that Joseph went into the house to attend to his duties, and none of the men of the household was there in the house. 
GEN.39.12	She caught Joseph by his [outer] robe, saying, “Lie with me!” But he left his robe in her hand and ran, and got outside [the house]. 
GEN.39.13	When she saw that he had left his robe in her hand and had run outside, 
GEN.39.14	she called to the men of her household and said to them, “Look at this, your master has brought a Hebrew [into the household] to mock 
GEN.39.15	When he heard me screaming, he left his robe with me and ran outside [the house].” 
GEN.39.16	So she left Joseph’s [outer] robe beside her until his master came home. 
GEN.39.17	Then she told her husband the same story, saying, “The Hebrew servant, whom you brought among us, came to me to mock 
GEN.39.18	then as soon as I raised my voice and screamed, he left his robe with me and ran outside [the house].”
GEN.39.19	And when Joseph’s master heard the words of his wife, saying, “This is the way your servant treated me,” his anger burned. 
GEN.39.20	So Joseph’s master took him and put him in the prison, a place where the king’s prisoners were confined; so he was there in the prison. 
GEN.39.21	But the L
GEN.39.22	The warden committed to Joseph’s care (management) all the prisoners who were in the prison; so that whatever was done there, he was 
GEN.39.23	The warden paid no attention to anything that was in Joseph’s care because the L
GEN.40.1	Now some time later, the cupbearer (butler) and the baker for the king of Egypt offended their lord, Egypt’s king. 
GEN.40.2	Pharaoh (
GEN.40.3	He put them in confinement in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined. 
GEN.40.4	The captain of the guard put Joseph in charge of them, and he served them; and they continued to be in custody for some time. 
GEN.40.5	Then the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison, both dreamed a dream in the same night, each man with his [own significant] dream and each dream with its [personal] interpretation. 
GEN.40.6	When Joseph came to them in the morning and looked at them, [he saw that] they were sad 
GEN.40.7	So he asked Pharaoh’s officials who were in confinement with him in his master’s house, “Why do you look so down-hearted today?” 
GEN.40.8	And they said to him, “We have [each] dreamed [distinct] dreams and there is no one to interpret them.” So Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Please tell me [your dreams].”
GEN.40.9	So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “In my dream there was a grapevine in front of me; 
GEN.40.10	and on the vine were three branches. Then as soon as it budded, its blossoms burst open, and its clusters produced ripe grapes [in rapid succession]. 
GEN.40.11	Now Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup; then I placed the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.” 
GEN.40.12	Then Joseph said to him, “This is the interpretation of it: the three branches represent three days; 
GEN.40.13	within three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head (present you in public) and restore you to your position; and you will [again] put Pharaoh’s cup into his hand just as [you did] when you were his cupbearer. 
GEN.40.14	Only think of me when it goes well with you, and please show me kindness by mentioning me to Pharaoh and get me out of this house. 
GEN.40.15	For in fact I was 
GEN.40.16	When the chief baker saw that the interpretation [of the dream] was good, he said to Joseph, “I also dreamed, and [in my dream] there were three cake baskets on my head; 
GEN.40.17	and in the top basket there were some of all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds [of prey] were eating [these foods] out of the basket on my head.” 
GEN.40.18	Joseph answered, “This is the interpretation of it: the three baskets represent three days; 
GEN.40.19	within three more days Pharaoh will 
GEN.40.20	Now on the third day, [which was] the Pharaoh’s birthday, he [released the two men from prison and] made a feast for all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker [that is, presented them in public] among his servants. 
GEN.40.21	He restored the chief cupbearer to his office, and the cupbearer [once again] put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand; 
GEN.40.22	but Pharaoh hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted [the meaning of the dreams] to them. 
GEN.40.23	Yet [even after all that] the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot [all about] him.
GEN.41.1	Now it happened at the end of two full years that Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the 
GEN.41.2	And lo, there came up out of the Nile seven [healthy] cows, sleek 
GEN.41.3	Then behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the Nile, ugly and gaunt 
GEN.41.4	Then the ugly and gaunt 
GEN.41.5	Then he fell asleep and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven ears of grain came up on a single stalk, plump and good. 
GEN.41.6	Then behold, seven ears [of grain], thin and dried up by the east wind, sprouted after them. 
GEN.41.7	Then the thin ears swallowed the seven plump and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and it was a dream. 
GEN.41.8	So when morning came his spirit was troubled 
GEN.41.9	Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, “I would mention my faults today. 
GEN.41.10	[Two years ago] Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and he put me in confinement in the house of the captain of the guard, both me and the chief baker. 
GEN.41.11	We dreamed a dream on the same night, he and I; each of us dreamed according to [the significance of] the interpretation of his own dream. 
GEN.41.12	Now there was with us [in the prison] a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted our dreams for us, to each man according to the significance of his own dream. 
GEN.41.13	And just as he interpreted [the dreams] for us, so it happened; I was restored to my office [as chief cupbearer], and the baker was hanged.”
GEN.41.14	Then Pharaoh sent and called for Joseph, and they hurriedly brought him out of the dungeon; and when Joseph shaved himself and changed his clothes [making himself presentable], he came to Pharaoh. 
GEN.41.15	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it; and I have heard it said about you that you can understand a dream and interpret it.” 
GEN.41.16	Joseph answered Pharaoh, “It is not in me [to interpret the dream]; God [not I] will give Pharaoh a 
GEN.41.17	So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “In my dream, I was standing on the bank of the Nile; 
GEN.41.18	and seven fat, sleek 
GEN.41.19	Lo, seven other cows came up after them, very ugly and gaunt [just skin and bones]; such emaciated animals as I have never seen in all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.20	And the lean and ugly cows ate up the first seven fat cows. 
GEN.41.21	Yet when they had devoured them, it could not be detected that they had eaten them, because they were still as thin 
GEN.41.22	I saw in my [second] dream, seven ears [of grain], plump and good, growing on a single stalk; 
GEN.41.23	and lo, seven [other] ears, withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind, sprouted after them; 
GEN.41.24	and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears. Now I told this to the magicians 
GEN.41.25	Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The [two] dreams are one [and the same and have one interpretation]; God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do. 
GEN.41.26	The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the [two] dreams are one [and the same]. 
GEN.41.27	The seven thin and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years; and also the seven thin ears, dried up 
GEN.41.28	This is the message just as I have told Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do. 
GEN.41.29	Listen very carefully: seven years of great abundance will come throughout all the land of Egypt; 
GEN.41.30	but afterward seven years of famine 
GEN.41.31	So the great abundance will become forgotten in the land because of that subsequent famine, for it will be very severe. 
GEN.41.32	That the dream was repeated twice to Pharaoh [and in two different ways] indicates that this matter is fully determined 
GEN.41.33	So now let Pharaoh [prepare ahead and] look for a man discerning 
GEN.41.34	Let Pharaoh take action to appoint overseers 
GEN.41.35	Let them gather [as a tax] all [of the fifth of] the food of these good years that are coming, and store up grain under the direction 
GEN.41.36	That food shall be put [in storage] as a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine 
GEN.41.37	Now the plan seemed good to Pharaoh and to all of his servants.
GEN.41.38	So Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find a man like this [a man equal to Joseph], in whom is the divine spirit [of God]?” 
GEN.41.39	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since [your] God has shown you all this, there is no one as discerning 
GEN.41.40	You shall have charge over my house, and all my people shall 
GEN.41.41	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I have set you [in charge] over all the land of Egypt.” 
GEN.41.42	Then Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph’s hand, and dressed him in [official] vestments of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck. 
GEN.41.43	He had him ride in his second chariot; and runners proclaimed before him, “[Attention,] bow the knee!” And he set him over all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.44	Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, “
GEN.41.45	Then Pharaoh named Joseph 
GEN.41.46	Now Joseph [had been in Egypt thirteen years and] was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Joseph departed from the presence of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt [performing his duties]. 
GEN.41.47	In the seven abundant years the earth produced handfuls [for each seed planted]. 
GEN.41.48	And Joseph gathered all the [surplus] food of the seven [good] years in the land of Egypt and stored [enormous quantities of] the food in the cities. He stored away in every city the food [collected] from its own surrounding fields. 
GEN.41.49	Thus Joseph gathered 
GEN.41.50	Now two sons were born to Joseph before the years of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him. 
GEN.41.51	Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh (causing to forget), for 
GEN.41.52	He named the second [son] Ephraim (fruitfulness), for “God has caused me to be fruitful 
GEN.41.53	When the seven years of plenty came to an end in the land of Egypt, 
GEN.41.54	the seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said [they would]; the famine was in all the [surrounding] lands, but in the land of Egypt there was bread (food). 
GEN.41.55	So when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried out to Pharaoh for food; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph; do whatever he says to you.” 
GEN.41.56	When the famine was 
GEN.41.57	And [the people of] all countries came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the [known] earth.
GEN.42.1	Now when Jacob (Israel) learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why are you staring at one another [in bewilderment and not taking action]?” 
GEN.42.2	He said, “I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down there and buy [some] grain for us, so that we may live and not die [of starvation].” 
GEN.42.3	So ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt. 
GEN.42.4	But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s [younger] brother, with his brothers, for he said, “I am afraid that some harm 
GEN.42.5	So the sons of Israel came [to Egypt] to buy grain along with the others who were coming, for famine was in the land of Canaan 
GEN.42.6	Now Joseph was the ruler over the land, and he was the one who sold [grain] to all the people of the land; and Joseph’s [half] brothers came and bowed down before him with 
GEN.42.7	When Joseph saw his brothers he recognized them, but [hiding his identity] he treated them as strangers and 
GEN.42.8	Joseph recognized his brothers, but 
GEN.42.9	Joseph remembered the dreams he had dreamed about them, and said to them, “You are spies; you have come [with a malicious purpose] to observe the 
GEN.42.10	But they said to him, “No, my lord, for your servants have [only] come to buy food. 
GEN.42.11	We are all the sons of one man; we are honest men, your servants are not spies.” 
GEN.42.12	Yet he said to them, “No, you have come to see the undefended parts of our land.” 
GEN.42.13	But they said, “Your servants are twelve brothers [in all], the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; please listen: the youngest is with our father today, and one is no longer alive.” 
GEN.42.14	Joseph said to them, “It is as I said to you, you are spies. 
GEN.42.15	In this way you shall be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here! 
GEN.42.16	Send one of you [back home], and let him bring your brother [here], while [the rest of] you remain confined, so that your words may be tested, [to see] whether there is any truth in you [and your story]; or else, by the life of Pharaoh, certainly you are spies.” 
GEN.42.17	Then Joseph put them all in prison for three days.
GEN.42.18	Now Joseph said to them on the third day, “Do this and [you may] live, for I fear God: 
GEN.42.19	if you are honest men, let one of your brothers be confined in your [place here in] prison; but as for 
GEN.42.20	but bring your youngest brother to me, so your words will be verified and you will not die.” And they did so. 
GEN.42.21	And they said to one another, “Truly we are guilty regarding our brother [Joseph], because we saw the distress 
GEN.42.22	Reuben answered them, “Did I not tell you, ‘Do not sin against the boy’; and you would not listen? Now the accounting for his blood is required [of us for we are guilty of his death].” 
GEN.42.23	They did not know that Joseph understood [their conversation], because he spoke to them through an interpreter. 
GEN.42.24	He turned away from his brothers and [left the room and] wept; then he returned and talked with them, and took Simeon from them and bound him in front of them [to be kept as a hostage in Egypt]. 
GEN.42.25	Then Joseph gave orders [privately] that their bags be filled with grain, and that every man’s money [used to pay for the grain] be put back in his sack, and that provisions be given to them for the journey. And so this was done for them.
GEN.42.26	They loaded their donkeys with grain and left from there. 
GEN.42.27	And at the lodging place, as one 
GEN.42.28	And he said to his brothers, “My money has been returned! Here it is in my sack!” And their hearts sank, and they were afraid 
GEN.42.29	When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they told him everything that had happened to them, saying, 
GEN.42.30	“The man who is the lord of the land spoke harshly to us, and took us for spies of the land. 
GEN.42.31	But we told him, ‘We are honest men; we are not spies. 
GEN.42.32	We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no longer alive, and the youngest is with our father today in the land of Canaan.’ 
GEN.42.33	And the man, the lord of the country, said to us, ‘By this [test] I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers here with me and take 
GEN.42.34	Bring your youngest brother to me; then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men. Then I will return your [imprisoned] brother [back] to you, and you may trade 
GEN.42.35	Now when they emptied their sacks, every man’s bundle of money [paid to buy grain] was in his sack. When they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid. 
GEN.42.36	Jacob their father said to them, “You have bereaved me [by causing the loss] of my children. Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and you would take Benjamin [from me]. All these things are [working] against me.” 
GEN.42.37	Then Reuben spoke to his father, “You may put my two sons to death if I do not bring Benjamin back to you; put him in my care, and I will return him to you.” 
GEN.42.38	But Jacob said, “My son shall not go down [to Egypt] with you; for his brother is dead, and he alone is left [of Rachel’s children]. If any harm 
GEN.43.1	Now the famine was very severe in the land [of Canaan]. 
GEN.43.2	And it happened that when the families of Jacob’s sons had finished eating [all of] the grain which they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go again, buy us a little food.” 
GEN.43.3	But Judah said to him, “The man [representing Pharaoh] solemnly 
GEN.43.4	If you will send our brother with us, we will go down [to Egypt] and buy you food. 
GEN.43.5	But if you will not send him, we will not go down there; for the man said to us, ‘You will not see my face unless your brother is with you.’ ” 
GEN.43.6	And Israel (Jacob) said, “Why did you treat me so badly by telling the man that you had 
GEN.43.7	And they said, “The man asked us straightforward questions about ourselves and our relatives. He said, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you 
GEN.43.8	Judah said to Israel his father, “Send the young man with me and we will get up and go [buy food], so that we may live and not die [of starvation], we as well as you and our little ones. 
GEN.43.9	I will be security (a guarantee) for him; 
GEN.43.10	For if we had not delayed like this, surely by now we would have returned the second time.”
GEN.43.11	Then their father Israel said to them, “If 
GEN.43.12	Take double the [amount of] money with you, and take back the money that was returned in the opening of your sacks; perhaps it was an oversight. 
GEN.43.13	Take your brother [Benjamin] also, and get up, and go to the man; 
GEN.43.14	and may 
GEN.43.15	Then the men took the present, and they took double the [amount of] money with them, and Benjamin; then they left and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.
GEN.43.16	When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Bring the men into the house, and kill an animal and make [a meal] ready; for the men will dine with me at noon.” 
GEN.43.17	So the man did as Joseph said, and brought the men to Joseph’s house. 
GEN.43.18	The men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph’s house; and [expecting the worst] they said, “It is because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time [we came] that we are being brought in, so that he may find a reason to accuse us and assail us, and take us as slaves, and 
GEN.43.19	So they approached the steward of Joseph’s house, and talked with him at the entrance of the house, 
GEN.43.20	and said, “Oh, my lord, we indeed came down here the first time to buy food; 
GEN.43.21	and when we arrived at the inn [after leaving here], we opened our sacks and there was each man’s money [with which he had paid for grain], in full, returned in the mouth of his sack. So we have brought it back [this time]. 
GEN.43.22	We have also brought down with us additional money to buy food; we do not know who put our money [back] in our sacks [last time].” 
GEN.43.23	But the steward [encouraged them and] said, “Peace be to you, do not be afraid; your God and the God of your father has [miraculously] given you treasure in your sacks. I [already] had your money [which you paid to us].” Then he brought Simeon out to them. 
GEN.43.24	Then the steward brought the men into Joseph’s house and gave them water, and they washed [the dust off] their feet; and he gave their donkeys feed. 
GEN.43.25	So they prepared the present [of tribute] for Joseph before his arrival at noon; for they had heard that they were to eat a meal there.
GEN.43.26	When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the present [of tribute] which they had with them and bowed to the ground before him. 
GEN.43.27	He asked them about their well-being, and said, “Is your old father well, of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?” 
GEN.43.28	And they answered, “Your servant our father is in good health; he is still alive.” And they bowed down [their heads before Joseph] in respect. 
GEN.43.29	And he looked up and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s [only other] son, and said, “Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?” And Joseph said, “God be gracious to you 
GEN.43.30	Then Joseph hurried out [of the room] because his heart was deeply touched over his brother, and he sought 
GEN.43.31	Then he washed his face and came out, and, restraining himself, said, “Let the meal be served.” 
GEN.43.32	So the servants served Joseph by himself [in honor of his rank], and his brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because [according to custom] the Egyptians could not eat food with the Hebrews, for that is 
GEN.43.33	Now Joseph’s brothers were seated [by the steward] before him [in the order of their birth]—the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth; and the men looked at one another in astonishment [because so much was known about them]. 
GEN.43.34	Joseph selected 
GEN.44.1	And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s [grain] money in the mouth of the sack. 
GEN.44.2	Put my [personal] cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, with his grain money.” And the steward did as Joseph had told him. 
GEN.44.3	As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys. 
GEN.44.4	When they had left the city, and were not yet far away, Joseph said to his steward, “Get up, follow after the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid evil [to us] for good [paid to you]? 
GEN.44.5	Is this not my lord’s drinking cup and the one which he uses for divination? You have done [a great and unforgivable] wrong in doing this.’ ”
GEN.44.6	So the steward overtook them and he said these words to them. 
GEN.44.7	They said to him, “Why does my lord speak these things? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing! 
GEN.44.8	Please remember, the money which we found in the mouths of our sacks we have brought back to you from the land of Canaan. Is it likely then that we would steal silver or gold from your master’s house? 
GEN.44.9	With whomever of your servants your master’s cup is found, let him die, and the rest of us will be my lord’s slaves.” 
GEN.44.10	And the steward said, “Now let it be as you say; he with whom the cup is found will be my slave, but 
GEN.44.11	Then every man quickly lowered his sack to the ground and each man opened his sack [confident the cup would not be found among them]. 
GEN.44.12	The steward searched, beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest, and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. 
GEN.44.13	Then they tore their clothes [in grief]; and after each man had loaded his donkey again, they returned to the city.
GEN.44.14	When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, he was still there; and they fell to the ground before him. 
GEN.44.15	Joseph spoke harshly to them, “What is this thing that you have done? Do you not realize that such a man as I can indeed practice divination 
GEN.44.16	So Judah said, “What can we say to my lord? What can we reply? Or how can we clear ourselves, since God has exposed the sin 
GEN.44.17	But Joseph said, “Far be it from me that I should do that; but the man in whose hand the cup has been found, he will be my servant; and as for [the rest of] you, get up and go in peace to your father.”
GEN.44.18	Then Judah approached him, and said, “O my lord, please let your servant say a word to you in private, and do not let your anger blaze against your servant, for you are equal to Pharaoh [so I speak as if directly to him]. 
GEN.44.19	My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father or a brother?’ 
GEN.44.20	We said to my lord, ‘We have an old father and a young [brother, Benjamin, the] child of his old age. Now his brother [Joseph] is dead, and he alone is left of [the two sons born of] his mother, and his father loves him.’ 
GEN.44.21	Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me that I may actually see him.’ 
GEN.44.22	But we said to my lord, ‘The 
GEN.44.23	You said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes with you, you shall not see my face again.’ 
GEN.44.24	So when we went back to your servant my father, we told him what my lord had said. 
GEN.44.25	Our father said, ‘Go back [to Egypt], and buy us a little food.’ 
GEN.44.26	But we said, ‘We cannot go down [to Egypt]. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down [there]; for we [were sternly told that we] cannot see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’ 
GEN.44.27	Your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife [Rachel] bore me [only] two sons. 
GEN.44.28	And one [son] went out from me, and I said, “Surely he is torn to pieces,” and I have not seen him since. 
GEN.44.29	If you take this one also from me, and harm 
GEN.44.30	Now, therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the young man is not with us, since 
GEN.44.31	when he sees that the young man is not 
GEN.44.32	For your servant became security for the young man to my father, saying, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, then let me bear the blame before my father forever.’ 
GEN.44.33	Now, therefore, please let your servant (Judah) remain here instead of the youth [to be] a slave to my lord, and let the young man go home with his brothers. 
GEN.44.34	How can I go up to my father if the young man is not with me—for fear that I would see the tragedy that would overtake my [elderly] father [if Benjamin does not return]?”
GEN.45.1	Then Joseph could not control himself [any longer] in front of all those who attended him, and he called out, “Have everyone leave me.” So no man stood there when Joseph revealed himself to his brothers. 
GEN.45.2	Joseph wept aloud, and the Egyptians [who had just left him] heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard of it. 
GEN.45.3	Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?” But his brothers were speechless, for they were stunned 
GEN.45.4	And Joseph said to his brothers, “Please come closer to me.” And they approached him. And he said, “I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. 
GEN.45.5	Now do not be distressed or angry with yourselves because you sold me here, for God sent me ahead of you to save life 
GEN.45.6	For the famine has been in the land these two years, and there are still five more years in which there will be no plowing and harvesting. 
GEN.45.7	God sent me [to Egypt] ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on the earth, and to keep you alive by a great escape. 
GEN.45.8	So now it was not you who sent me here, but God; and He has made me a father to Pharaoh and lord of all his household and ruler over all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.45.9	Hurry and go up to my father, and tell him, ‘Your son Joseph says this to you: “God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not delay. 
GEN.45.10	You shall live in the land of Goshen [the best pasture land of Egypt], and you shall be close to me—you and your children and your grandchildren, your flocks and your herds and all you have. 
GEN.45.11	There I will provide for you 
GEN.45.12	Look! Your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that I am speaking to you [personally in your language and not through an interpreter]. 
GEN.45.13	Now you must tell my father of all my splendor 
GEN.45.14	Then he embraced his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck. 
GEN.45.15	He kissed all his brothers and wept on them, and afterward his brothers talked with him.
GEN.45.16	When the news was heard in Pharaoh’s house that Joseph’s brothers had come, it pleased Pharaoh and his servants. 
GEN.45.17	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Do this: load your animals and return to the land of Canaan [without delay], 
GEN.45.18	and get your father and your households and come to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you will eat the fat (the finest produce) of the land.’ 
GEN.45.19	Now you [brothers of Joseph] are ordered [by Pharaoh], ‘Do this: take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father and come. 
GEN.45.20	Do not be concerned with your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.’ ”
GEN.45.21	Then the sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them wagons according to the command of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the journey. 
GEN.45.22	To each of them Joseph gave changes of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred 
GEN.45.23	To his father he sent the following: ten 
GEN.45.24	So he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he said to them, “See that you do not quarrel on the journey [about how to explain this to our father].” 
GEN.45.25	So they went up from Egypt, and came to the land of Canaan to Jacob their father, 
GEN.45.26	and they said to him, “Joseph is still alive, and indeed he is ruler over all the land of Egypt.” But Jacob was stunned 
GEN.45.27	When they told him everything that Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of their father Jacob revived. 
GEN.45.28	And Israel (Jacob) said, “It is enough! Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.”
GEN.46.1	So Israel set out with all that he had, and came to Beersheba [where both his father and grandfather had worshiped God], and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. 
GEN.46.2	And God spoke to Israel in visions of the night and said, “Jacob, Jacob!” And he said, “Here I am.” 
GEN.46.3	And He said, “I am God, the God of your father; do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you (your descendants) a great nation there. 
GEN.46.4	I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also surely bring you (your people) up again; and Joseph will put his hand on your eyes [to close them at the time of your death].”
GEN.46.5	So Jacob set out from Beersheba; and the sons of Israel carried their father Jacob and their children and their wives in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 
GEN.46.6	And they took their livestock and the possessions which they had acquired in the land of Canaan and came to Egypt, Jacob and all his descendants with him. 
GEN.46.7	His sons and his grandsons, his daughters and his granddaughters, and all his descendants he brought with him to Egypt.
GEN.46.8	Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, Jacob and his sons, who went to Egypt: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn. 
GEN.46.9	The sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. 
GEN.46.10	The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. 
GEN.46.11	The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
GEN.46.12	The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah—but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. 
GEN.46.13	The sons of Issachar: Tola, 
GEN.46.14	The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel. 
GEN.46.15	These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah; all of his sons and daughters 
GEN.46.16	The sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli. 
GEN.46.17	The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and Serah their sister. And the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel. 
GEN.46.18	These are the sons of Zilpah, [the maid] whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter [when she married Jacob]; and she bore to Jacob these sixteen persons [two sons and fourteen grandchildren]. 
GEN.46.19	The sons of Rachel, Jacob’s wife: Joseph and Benjamin. 
GEN.46.20	Now to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On (Heliopolis in Egypt), bore to him. 
GEN.46.21	And the sons of 
GEN.46.22	These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob; [there were] fourteen persons in all [two sons and twelve grandchildren]. 
GEN.46.23	The son of Dan: Hushim. 
GEN.46.24	The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. 
GEN.46.25	These are the sons of Bilhah, [the maid] whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter [when she married Jacob]. And she bore these to Jacob; [there were] seven persons in all [two sons and five grandchildren]. 
GEN.46.26	All the persons who came with Jacob into Egypt—who were his direct descendants, not counting the wives of [Jacob or] Jacob’s sons, were sixty-six persons in all, 
GEN.46.27	and the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two. All the persons of the house of Jacob [including Jacob, and 
GEN.46.28	Now Jacob (Israel) sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph, to direct him to Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. 
GEN.46.29	Then Joseph prepared his chariot and went up to meet Israel his father in Goshen; as soon as he presented himself before him (authenticating his identity), he fell on his [father’s] neck and wept on his neck a [very] long time. 
GEN.46.30	And Israel said to Joseph, “Now let me die [in peace], since I have seen your face [and know] that you are still alive.” 
GEN.46.31	Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I will go up and tell Pharaoh, and say to him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me; 
GEN.46.32	and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock; and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.’ 
GEN.46.33	And it shall be that when Pharaoh calls you and says, ‘What is your occupation?’ 
GEN.46.34	you shall say, ‘Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth until now, both we and our fathers [before us],’ in order that you may live [separately and securely] in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is repulsive to the Egyptians.”
GEN.47.1	Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, “My father and my brothers, with their flocks and their herds and all that they own, have come from the land of Canaan, and they are in the land of Goshen.” 
GEN.47.2	He took five men from among his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.3	And Pharaoh said to his brothers [as Joseph expected], “What is your occupation?” And they said to Pharaoh, “Your servants are shepherds, both we and our fathers [before us].” 
GEN.47.4	Moreover, they said to Pharaoh, “We have come to live temporarily (sojourn) in the land [of Egypt], for there is no pasture for the flocks of your servants [in our land], for the famine is very severe in Canaan. So now, please let your servants live in the land of Goshen.” 
GEN.47.5	Then Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, “Your father and your brothers have come to you. 
GEN.47.6	The land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land. Let them live in the land of Goshen; and if you know of any men of ability among them, 
GEN.47.7	Then Joseph brought Jacob (Israel) his father and presented him before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.8	And Pharaoh asked Jacob, 
GEN.47.9	Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The 
GEN.47.10	And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and departed from his presence. 
GEN.47.11	So Joseph settled his father and brothers and gave them a possession in Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses (Goshen), as Pharaoh commanded. 
GEN.47.12	Joseph provided 
GEN.47.13	Now [in the course of time] there was no food in all the land, for the famine was distressingly severe, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan languished [in destitution and starvation] because of the famine. 
GEN.47.14	Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan [in payment] for the grain which they bought, and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house. 
GEN.47.15	And when the money was exhausted in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, “Give us food! Why should we die before your very eyes? For our money is gone.” 
GEN.47.16	Joseph said, “Give up your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock, since the money is gone.” 
GEN.47.17	So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for the horses and the flocks and the herds and the donkeys; and he supplied them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year. 
GEN.47.18	When that year was ended, they came to him the next year and said to him, “We will not hide from my lord [the fact] that our money is spent; my lord also has our herds of livestock; there is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands. 
GEN.47.19	Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. And give us seed [to plant], that we may live and not die, and that the land may not be desolate.”
GEN.47.20	So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for every Egyptian sold his field because the famine was severe upon them. So the land became Pharaoh’s. 
GEN.47.21	And as for the people, he relocated them [temporarily] to cities from one end of Egypt’s border to the other. 
GEN.47.22	Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had an allotment from Pharaoh, and they lived on the amount which Pharaoh gave them, so they did not sell their land. 
GEN.47.23	Then Joseph said to the people, “Look, today I have bought you and your land for Pharaoh; now, here is seed for you, and you shall plant the land. 
GEN.47.24	At harvest time [when you reap the increase] you shall give one-fifth of it to Pharaoh, and four-fifths will be your own to use for seed for the field and as food for you and those of your households and for your little ones.” 
GEN.47.25	And they said, “You have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.” 
GEN.47.26	And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt—valid to this 
GEN.47.27	Now [the people of] Israel lived in the country of Egypt, in [the land of] Goshen, and they gained possessions 
GEN.47.28	And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; so the 
GEN.47.29	And when the time drew near for Israel to die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, “If now I have found favor in your sight, 
GEN.47.30	but when I lie down with my fathers [in death], you will carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place [at Hebron in the cave of Machpelah].” And Joseph said, “I will do as you have directed.” 
GEN.47.31	Then he said, “Swear to me [that you will do it].” So he swore to him. Then Israel (Jacob) bowed 
GEN.48.1	Now some time after these things happened, Joseph was told, “Your father is sick.” So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim with him [to go to Goshen]. 
GEN.48.2	And when Jacob (Israel) was told, “Look now, your son Joseph has come to you,” Israel strengthened himself and sat up on the bed. 
GEN.48.3	Then Jacob said to Joseph, “
GEN.48.4	and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful and numerous, and I will make you a great company of people, and will give this land to your descendants after you as an everlasting possession.’ 
GEN.48.5	Now your two sons [Ephraim and Manasseh], who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; 
GEN.48.6	But other sons who were born to you after them shall be your own; they shall be called by the names of their [two] brothers in their inheritance. 
GEN.48.7	Now as for me, when I came from Paddan [in Mesopotamia], Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the journey, when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).”
GEN.48.8	When Israel [who was almost blind] saw Joseph’s sons, he said, “Who are these?” 
GEN.48.9	Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here [in Egypt].” So he said, “Please bring them to me, so that I may bless them.” 
GEN.48.10	Now Israel’s eyes were so dim from age that he could not see [clearly]. Then Joseph brought them close to him, and he kissed and embraced them. 
GEN.48.11	Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected to see your face, but see, God has shown me your children as well.” 
GEN.48.12	Then Joseph took the boys [from his father’s embrace], and he bowed [before him] with his face to the ground. 
GEN.48.13	Then Joseph took them both, Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel’s left, and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel’s right, and brought them close to him. 
GEN.48.14	But Israel reached out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh’s head, 
GEN.48.15	Then Jacob (Israel) blessed Joseph, and said,
GEN.48.15	“The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked [in faithful obedience],
GEN.48.15	The God who has been my Shepherd [leading and caring for me] all my life to this day,
GEN.48.16	The 
GEN.48.16	Bless the boys;
GEN.48.16	And may my name live on in them [may they be worthy of having their names linked with mine],
GEN.48.16	And the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac;
GEN.48.16	And may they grow into a [great] multitude in the midst of the earth.”
GEN.48.17	When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on Ephraim’s head, it displeased him [because he was not the firstborn]; and he grasped his father’s hand to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head. 
GEN.48.18	Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn; place your right hand on Manasseh’s head.” 
GEN.48.19	But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know; Manasseh also will become a people and he will be great; but his younger brother shall be 
GEN.48.20	Then Jacob blessed them that day, saying,
GEN.48.20	“By you Israel will pronounce a blessing, saying,
GEN.48.20	‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.’ ”
GEN.48.20	And he put Ephraim before Manasseh. 
GEN.48.21	Then Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am about to die, but God will be with you, and bring you back to [Canaan] the land of your fathers. 
GEN.48.22	Moreover, I have given you [the 
GEN.49.1	Then Jacob called for his sons and said, “Assemble yourselves [around me] that I may tell you what will happen to you 
GEN.49.2	Gather together and hear, O sons of Jacob;
GEN.49.2	And listen to Israel (Jacob) your father.
GEN.49.3	“Reuben, you are my 
GEN.49.3	My might, the beginning of my strength 
GEN.49.3	Preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power [that should have been your birthright].
GEN.49.4	But unstable 
GEN.49.4	Because you went up to your father’s bed [with Bilhah];
GEN.49.4	You defiled it—he went up to my couch.
GEN.49.5	“Simeon and Levi are brothers [equally headstrong, deceitful, vindictive, and cruel];
GEN.49.5	Their swords are weapons of violence 
GEN.49.6	O my soul, do not come into their secret council;
GEN.49.6	Let not my glory (honor) be united with their assembly [for I knew nothing of their plot];
GEN.49.6	Because in their anger they killed men [an honored man, Shechem, and the Shechemites],
GEN.49.6	And in their self-will they lamed oxen.
GEN.49.7	Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce;
GEN.49.7	And their wrath, for it was cruel.

GEN.49.10	The scepter [of royalty] shall not depart from Judah,

GEN.49.28	All these are the [beginnings of the] twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them as he blessed them, blessing each one according to the blessing appropriate to him. 
GEN.49.29	He charged them and said to them, “I am to be gathered to my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 
GEN.49.30	in the cave in the field at Machpelah, east of Mamre, in the land of Canaan, that Abraham bought, along with the field from Ephron the Hittite, to possess as a burial site. 
GEN.49.31	There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife, there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah— 
GEN.49.32	the field and the cave that is in it was purchased from the sons of Heth.” 
GEN.49.33	When Jacob (Israel) had finished commanding his sons, he drew his feet into the bed and breathed his last, and was 
GEN.50.1	Then Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept over him and kissed him [tenderly]. 
GEN.50.2	Then Joseph ordered his servants the physicians to embalm (mummify) his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel (Jacob). 
GEN.50.3	Now forty days were required for this, for that is the customary number of days [of preparation] required for embalming. And the Egyptians wept 
GEN.50.4	When the days of weeping 
GEN.50.5	‘My father made me swear [an oath], saying, “Hear me, I am about to die; bury me in my tomb which I prepared for myself in the land of Canaan.” So now let me go up [to Canaan], please, and bury my father; then I will return.’ ” 
GEN.50.6	And Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear.”
GEN.50.7	So Joseph went up [to Canaan] to bury his father, and with him went all the officials of Pharaoh, [the nobles of his court and] the elders of his household and all [the nobles and] the elders of the land of Egypt— 
GEN.50.8	and all the household of Joseph and his brothers and his father’s household. They left only their little ones and their flocks and herds in the land of Goshen. 
GEN.50.9	Both chariots and horsemen also went up [to Canaan] with Joseph; and it was a very great company. 
GEN.50.10	When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they mourned there with a great lamentation (expressions of mourning for the deceased) and [extreme demonstrations of] sorrow [according to Egyptian custom]; and Joseph observed a seven-day mourning for his father. 
GEN.50.11	When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a grievous mourning for the Egyptians.” Therefore the place was named Abel-mizraim (mourning of Egypt); it is west of the Jordan.
GEN.50.12	So Jacob’s sons did for him as he had commanded them; 
GEN.50.13	for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, east of Mamre, which Abraham bought along with the field as a burial site from Ephron the Hittite. 
GEN.50.14	After he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers, and all who had gone up with him.
GEN.50.15	When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “What if Joseph carries a grudge against us and pays us back in full for all the wrong which we did to him?” 
GEN.50.16	So they sent 
GEN.50.17	‘You are to say to Joseph, “I beg you, please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin, for they did you wrong.” ’ Now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.” And Joseph wept when they spoke to him. 
GEN.50.18	Then his brothers went and fell down before him [in confession]; then they said, “Behold, we are your servants (slaves).” 
GEN.50.19	But Joseph said to them, “Do not be afraid, for am I in the place of God? [Vengeance is His, not mine.] 
GEN.50.20	As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good in order to bring about this present outcome, that many people would be kept alive [as they are this day]. 
GEN.50.21	So now, do not be afraid; I will provide for you 
GEN.50.22	Now Joseph lived in Egypt, he and his father’s household, and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years. 
GEN.50.23	Joseph saw the third generation of Ephraim’s children; also the children of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born 
GEN.50.24	Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but God will surely take care of you and bring you up out of this land to the land which He promised to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob [to give you].” 
GEN.50.25	Then Joseph made the sons of Israel (Jacob) swear [an oath], saying, “God will surely visit you 
GEN.50.26	So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him and he was put 
EXO.1.1	Now these are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob; each came with his household: 
EXO.1.2	Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; 
EXO.1.3	Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; 
EXO.1.4	Dan and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. 
EXO.1.5	All the descendants of Jacob were seventy people; Joseph was [already] in Egypt. 
EXO.1.6	Then Joseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation, 
EXO.1.7	but the 
EXO.1.9	He said to his people, “Behold, the 
EXO.1.10	Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, so that they will not multiply and in the event of war, join our enemies, and fight against us and escape from the land.” 
EXO.1.11	So they set taskmasters over them to oppress them with hard labor. And the sons of Israel built Pithom and Raamses as storage cities for Pharaoh. 
EXO.1.12	But the more the Egyptians oppressed them, the more they multiplied and expanded, so that the Egyptians dreaded 
EXO.1.13	And the Egyptians made the Israelites serve rigorously [forcing them into severe slavery]. 
EXO.1.14	They made their lives bitter with hard labor in mortar, brick, and all kinds of field work. All their labor was harsh 
EXO.1.15	Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah (beauty) and the other named Puah (splendor), 
EXO.1.16	“When you act as midwives to the Hebrew women and see them on the birthstool, if it is a son, you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, she shall live.” 
EXO.1.17	But the midwives feared God [with profound reverence] and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded, but they let the boy babies live. 
EXO.1.18	So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, “Why have you done this thing, and allowed the boy babies to live?” 
EXO.1.19	The midwives answered Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth quickly and their babies are born before the midwife can get to them.” 
EXO.1.20	So God was good to the midwives, and the people [of Israel] multiplied and became very strong. 
EXO.1.21	And because the midwives feared God [with profound reverence], 
EXO.1.22	Then 
EXO.2.1	Now a 
EXO.2.2	The woman conceived and gave birth to a son; and when she saw that he was [especially] beautiful 
EXO.2.3	When she could no longer hide him, she got him a basket (chest) made of papyrus reeds and covered it with tar and pitch [making it waterproof]. Then she put the child in it and set it among the reeds by the bank of the Nile. 
EXO.2.4	And his sister [Miriam] stood some distance away to find out what would happen to him.
EXO.2.5	Now the 
EXO.2.6	When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the baby was crying. And she took pity on him and said, “This is one of the Hebrews’ children.” 
EXO.2.7	Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and call a 
EXO.2.8	And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go 
EXO.2.9	Then Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.” So the woman took the child and nursed him. 
EXO.2.10	And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter and he became her son. And she named him 
EXO.2.11	One day, after Moses had grown [into adulthood], it happened that he went to his countrymen and looked [with compassion] at their hard labors; and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his countrymen. 
EXO.2.12	He turned to look around, and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. 
EXO.2.13	He went out the next day and saw two Hebrew men fighting with each other; and he said to the aggressor, “Why are you striking your friend?” 
EXO.2.14	But the man said, “Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you intend to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid and said, “Certainly this incident is known.”
EXO.2.15	When 
EXO.2.16	Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came and drew water [from the well where Moses was resting] and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock. 
EXO.2.17	Then shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock. 
EXO.2.18	When they came to 
EXO.2.19	They said, “An Egyptian saved us from the shepherds. He even drew water [from the well] for us and watered the flock.” 
EXO.2.20	Then he said to his daughters, “Where is he? Why have you left the man behind? Invite him to have something to eat.” 
EXO.2.21	Moses was willing to remain with the man, and he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah [to be his wife]. 
EXO.2.22	She gave birth to a son, and he named him Gershom (stranger); for he said, “I have been a stranger in a foreign land.”
EXO.2.23	Now it happened after a long time [about forty years] that the king of Egypt died. And the children of Israel (Jacob) groaned 
EXO.2.24	So God heard their groaning and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Israel). 
EXO.2.25	God saw the sons of Israel, and God took notice [of them] 
EXO.3.1	Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro (Reuel) his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led his flock to the west side of the wilderness and came to Horeb (Sinai), the mountain of God. 
EXO.3.2	The 
EXO.3.3	So Moses said, “I must turn away [from the flock] and see this great sight—why the bush is not burned up.” 
EXO.3.4	When the L
EXO.3.5	Then God said, “Do not come near; take your sandals off your feet [out of respect], because the place on which you are standing is holy ground.” 
EXO.3.6	Then He said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” Then Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.
EXO.3.7	The L
EXO.3.8	So I have come down to rescue them from the hand (power) of the Egyptians, and to bring them up from that land to a land [that is] good and spacious, to a land 
EXO.3.9	Now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to Me; and I have also seen how the Egyptians oppress them.
EXO.3.10	Therefore, come now, and I will send you to Pharaoh, and then bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.” 
EXO.3.11	But Moses said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?” 
EXO.3.12	And God said, “Certainly I will be with you, and this shall be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve 
EXO.3.13	Then Moses said to God, “Behold, when I come to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers (ancestors) has sent me to you,’ and they say to me, ‘What is His name?’ What shall I say to them?” 
EXO.3.14	God said to Moses, “
EXO.3.15	Then God also said to Moses, “This is what you shall say to the Israelites, ‘The L
EXO.3.16	Go, gather the elders (tribal leaders) of Israel together, and say to them, ‘The L
EXO.3.17	So I said I will bring you up out of the suffering 
EXO.3.18	The elders [of the tribes] will listen 
EXO.3.19	But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless [he is forced] by a strong hand. 
EXO.3.20	So I will reach out My hand and strike Egypt with all My wonders which I shall do in the midst of it; and after that he will let you go. 
EXO.3.21	And I will grant this people favor 
EXO.3.22	But every woman shall [insistently] ask her neighbor and any woman who 
EXO.4.1	Then Moses answered [the L
EXO.4.2	And the L
EXO.4.3	Then He said, “Throw it on the ground.” So Moses threw it on the ground, and it became a [living] serpent [like the royal symbol on the crown of Pharaoh]; and Moses ran from it. 
EXO.4.4	But the L
EXO.4.5	[“You shall do this,” said the L
EXO.4.6	The L
EXO.4.7	Then God said, “Put your hand into your robe again.” So he put his hand back into his robe, and when he took it out, it was restored [and was] like the rest of his body. 
EXO.4.8	“If they will not believe you or pay attention to the evidence of the first sign, they may believe the evidence of the second sign. 
EXO.4.9	But if they will not believe these two signs or pay attention to what you say, you are to take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground; and the water which you take out of the river will turn into blood on the dry ground.”
EXO.4.10	Then Moses said to the L
EXO.4.11	The L
EXO.4.12	Now then go, and I, even I, will be with your mouth, and will teach you what you shall say.” 
EXO.4.13	But he said, “Please my Lord, send 
EXO.4.14	Then the anger of the L
EXO.4.15	You must speak to him and put the words in his mouth; I, even I, will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and I will teach you what you are to do. 
EXO.4.16	Moreover, he shall speak for you to the people; he will act as a mouthpiece for you, and you will be as God to him [telling him what I say to you]. 
EXO.4.17	You shall take in your hand this staff, with which you shall perform the signs [the miracles which prove I sent you].”
EXO.4.18	Then Moses went away and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, “Please, let me go back so that I may return to my 
EXO.4.19	Then the L
EXO.4.20	So Moses took his wife [Zipporah] and his sons [Gershom and Eliezer] and seated them on donkeys, and returned to the land of Egypt. Moses also took the staff of God in his hand.
EXO.4.21	The L
EXO.4.22	Then you shall say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says the L
EXO.4.23	So I say to you, ‘Let My son go so that he may serve Me’; and if you refuse to let him go, behold, I will kill your son, your firstborn.” ’ ”
EXO.4.24	Now it happened at the lodging place, that the L
EXO.4.25	Then Zipporah took a flint knife and cut off the foreskin of her son and threw it at Moses’ feet, and said, “Indeed you are a husband of blood to me!” 
EXO.4.26	So He let Moses alone [to recover]. At that time Zipporah said, “
EXO.4.27	The L
EXO.4.28	Moses told Aaron all the words of the L
EXO.4.29	Then Moses and Aaron went [into Egypt] and assembled all the elders of the Israelites; 
EXO.4.30	and Aaron said all the words which the L
EXO.4.31	So the people believed; and when they heard that the L
EXO.5.1	Afterward Moses and Aaron came and said to Pharaoh, “Thus says the L
EXO.5.2	But Pharaoh said, “Who is the L
EXO.5.3	Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please, let us go on a three days’ journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the L
EXO.5.4	But the king of Egypt said to Moses and Aaron, “Why do you take the people away from their work? Get back to your burdens!” 
EXO.5.5	Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land are now many, and you would have them stop their work!” 
EXO.5.6	The very same day Pharaoh gave orders to the [Egyptian] taskmasters in charge of the people and their [Hebrew] foremen, saying, 
EXO.5.7	“You will no longer give the people 
EXO.5.8	But the number of bricks which they were making before, you shall [still] require of them; you are not to reduce it in the least. For they are idle 
EXO.5.9	Let labor be heavier on the men, and let them work [hard] at it so that they will pay no attention to [their God’s] lying words.”
EXO.5.10	Then the [Egyptian] taskmasters [in charge] of the people and their [Hebrew] foremen went out and said to the people, “Thus says Pharaoh, ‘I will not give you any straw. 
EXO.5.11	Go, get straw for yourselves wherever you can find it, but your work [quota] will not be reduced in the least.’ ” 
EXO.5.12	So the people were scattered throughout the land of Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw. 
EXO.5.13	And the taskmasters pressured them, saying, “Finish your work, [fulfill] your daily quotas, just as when there was straw [given to you].” 
EXO.5.14	And the Hebrew foremen, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, “Why have you not fulfilled your required quota of making bricks yesterday and today, as before?”
EXO.5.15	Then the Hebrew foremen came to Pharaoh and cried, “Why do you deal like this with your servants? 
EXO.5.16	No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, ‘Make bricks!’ And look, your servants are being beaten, but it is the fault of your own people.” 
EXO.5.17	But Pharaoh said, “You are lazy, very lazy 
EXO.5.18	Get out now and get to work; for no straw will be given to you, yet you are to deliver the same quota of bricks.” 
EXO.5.19	The Hebrew foremen saw that they were in a bad situation because they were told, “You must not reduce [in the least] your daily quota of bricks.” 
EXO.5.20	When they left Pharaoh’s presence, the foremen met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them. 
EXO.5.21	And the foremen said to them, “May the L
EXO.5.22	Then Moses turned again to the L
EXO.5.23	Ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has harmed 
EXO.6.1	Then the L
EXO.6.2	Then God spoke further to Moses and said to him, “I am the L
EXO.6.3	I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob (Israel) as God Almighty [El Shaddai], but by My 
EXO.6.4	I also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they lived as strangers (temporary residents, foreigners). 
EXO.6.5	And I have also heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, whom the Egyptians have enslaved, and I have [faithfully] remembered My covenant [with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob]. 
EXO.6.6	Therefore, say to the children of Israel, ‘I am the L
EXO.6.7	Then I will take you for My people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the L
EXO.6.8	I will bring you to the land which I 
EXO.6.9	Moses told this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their 
EXO.6.10	The L
EXO.6.11	“Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the children of Israel go out of his land.” 
EXO.6.12	But Moses said to the L
EXO.6.13	Then the L
EXO.6.14	These are the heads of their fathers’ households. The sons of Reuben, Israel’s (Jacob’s) firstborn: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben. 
EXO.6.15	The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon. 
EXO.6.16	These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their births: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari; and Levi lived a hundred and thirty-seven years. 
EXO.6.17	The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, by their families. 
EXO.6.18	The sons of Kohath: Amram (Moses’ father), Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel; and Kohath lived a hundred and thirty-three years. 
EXO.6.19	The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of Levi according to their generations. 
EXO.6.20	Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed, and she gave birth to Aaron and Moses; and Amram lived a hundred and thirty-seven years. 
EXO.6.21	The sons of Izhar: Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri. 
EXO.6.22	The sons of Uzziel: Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri. 
EXO.6.23	Aaron married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab and the sister of Nahshon, and she gave birth to Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
EXO.6.24	The sons of Korah: Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These are the [extended] families of the Korahites. 
EXO.6.25	Eleazar, Aaron’s son, married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she gave birth to Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers’ households of the Levites by their families. 
EXO.6.26	These are [the same] Aaron and Moses to whom the L
EXO.6.27	They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing the Israelites out of Egypt; these are [the same] Moses and Aaron.
EXO.6.28	Now it happened on the day when the L
EXO.6.29	that He said, “I am the L
EXO.6.30	But Moses said before the L
EXO.7.1	Then the L
EXO.7.2	You shall speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron shall tell Pharaoh to let the children of Israel go out of his land. 
EXO.7.3	And I will make Pharaoh’s heart hard, and multiply My signs and My wonders (miracles) in the land of Egypt. 
EXO.7.4	But Pharaoh will not listen to you, and I shall lay My hand on Egypt and bring out My hosts [like a defensive army, tribe by tribe], My people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great acts of judgment (the plagues). 
EXO.7.5	The Egyptians shall know that I am the L
EXO.7.6	And Moses and Aaron did so; just as the L
EXO.7.7	Now Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three years old when they spoke to Pharaoh.
EXO.7.8	Now the L
EXO.7.9	“When Pharaoh says to you, ‘Work a miracle [to prove your authority],’ then you say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh, so that it may become a serpent.’ ” 
EXO.7.10	So Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and did just as the L
EXO.7.11	Then Pharaoh called for the wise men [skilled in magic and omens] and the sorcerers [skilled in witchcraft], and they also, these magicians (soothsayer-priests) of Egypt, did the same with their secret arts 
EXO.7.12	For every 
EXO.7.13	Yet Pharaoh’s heart was hardened and he would not listen to them, just as the L
EXO.7.14	Then the L
EXO.7.15	Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he is going out to the water, and wait for him on the bank of the Nile; and you shall take in your hand the staff that was turned into a serpent. 
EXO.7.16	You shall say to him, ‘The L
EXO.7.17	Thus says the L
EXO.7.18	The fish in the Nile will die, and the Nile will become foul, and the Egyptians will not be able to drink water from the Nile.” ’ ” 
EXO.7.19	Then the L
EXO.7.20	So Moses and Aaron did as the L
EXO.7.21	The fish in the Nile died, and the river became foul smelling, and the Egyptians could not drink its water, and there was blood throughout 
EXO.7.22	But the magicians of Egypt did the 
EXO.7.23	Then Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he did not take even this [divine sign] to heart. 
EXO.7.24	So all the Egyptians dug near the river for water to drink, because they could not drink the water of the Nile. 
EXO.7.25	Seven days passed after the L
EXO.8.1	Then the L
EXO.8.2	However, if you refuse to let them go, hear this: I am going to strike your entire land with frogs. 
EXO.8.3	The Nile will swarm with frogs, which will come up and go into your home, into your bedroom and on to your bed, and into the houses of your servants and on your people, and into your ovens and your kneading bowls. 
EXO.8.4	So the frogs will come up on you and on your people and all your servants.” ’ ” 
EXO.8.5	Then the L
EXO.8.6	So Aaron stretched out his hand [with his staff] over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt. 
EXO.8.7	But the magicians (soothsayer-priests) did the same thing with their secret arts 
EXO.8.8	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Plead with the L
EXO.8.9	And Moses said to Pharaoh, “I am entirely at your service: when shall I plead [with the Lord] for you and your servants and your people, so that the frogs may leave you and your houses and remain only in the Nile?”
EXO.8.10	Then Pharaoh said, “
EXO.8.11	The frogs will leave you and your houses and leave your servants and your people; they will remain only in the Nile.” 
EXO.8.12	So Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, and Moses cried out to the L
EXO.8.13	The L
EXO.8.14	So they piled them up in heaps, and the land was detestable 
EXO.8.15	But when Pharaoh saw that there was [temporary] relief, he hardened his heart and would not listen 
EXO.8.16	Then the L
EXO.8.17	They did so; Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, and there were [biting] gnats on man and animal. All the dust of the land became gnats through all the land of Egypt. 
EXO.8.18	The magicians (soothsayer-priests) tried by their secret arts 
EXO.8.19	Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the [supernatural] finger of God.” But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened and he would not listen to them, just as the L
EXO.8.20	Now the L
EXO.8.21	For if you do not let My people go, hear this: I will send swarms of [bloodsucking] insects on you and on your servants and on your people and into your houses; and the houses of the Egyptians will be full of swarms of insects, as well as the ground on which they stand. 
EXO.8.22	But on that day I will separate 
EXO.8.23	I will 
EXO.8.24	Then the L
EXO.8.25	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God [here] in the land [of Egypt].” 
EXO.8.26	But Moses said, “It is not right [or even possible] to do that, for we will sacrifice to the L
EXO.8.27	We must go a three days’ journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the L
EXO.8.28	So Pharaoh said, “I will let you go, so that you may sacrifice to the L
EXO.8.29	Moses said, “I am going to leave you, and I will urgently petition (pray, entreat) the L
EXO.8.30	So Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the L
EXO.8.31	The L
EXO.8.32	But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go.
EXO.9.1	Then the L
EXO.9.2	But if you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them, 
EXO.9.3	now hear this: the hand of the L
EXO.9.4	But the L
EXO.9.5	The L
EXO.9.6	And the L
EXO.9.7	Then Pharaoh sent [men to investigate], and not even one of the livestock of the Israelites had died. But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened [and his mind was firmly set], and he did not let the people go.
EXO.9.8	Then the L
EXO.9.9	It will become fine dust over the entire land of Egypt, and it will become boils breaking out in sores on man and animal in all the land [occupied by the Egyptians].” 
EXO.9.10	So they took soot from the kiln, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses threw it toward the sky, and it became boils erupting in sores on man and animal. 
EXO.9.11	The magicians (soothsayer-priests) could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were on the magicians as well as on all the Egyptians. 
EXO.9.12	But the L
EXO.9.13	Then the L
EXO.9.14	For this time I will send all My plagues 
EXO.9.15	For by now I could have put out My hand and struck you and your people with a pestilence, and you would then have been cut off (obliterated) from the earth. 
EXO.9.16	But indeed for this very reason I have allowed you to live, in order to show you My power and in order that My name may be proclaimed throughout all the earth.
EXO.9.17	Since you are still [arrogantly] exalting yourself [in defiance] against My people by not letting them go, 
EXO.9.18	hear this: tomorrow about this time I will send a very heavy

EXO.9.20	Then everyone among the servants of Pharaoh who feared the word of the L

EXO.9.23	Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, and the L
EXO.9.24	So there was hail, and lightning (fireballs) flashing intermittently in the midst of the extremely heavy hail, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. 
EXO.9.25	The hail struck down everything that was in the field throughout all the land of Egypt, both man and animal; the hail struck 
EXO.9.26	Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel lived, was there no hail.
EXO.9.27	Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, “I have sinned this time; the L
EXO.9.28	Pray 
EXO.9.29	Moses said to him, “As soon as I leave the city, I will stretch out my hands to the L
EXO.9.30	But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the L
EXO.9.31	(Now the flax and the barley were battered 
EXO.9.32	but the wheat and spelt (coarse wheat) were not battered 
EXO.9.33	So Moses left the city and Pharaoh, and stretched out his hands to the L
EXO.9.34	But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned again and hardened his heart, both he and his servants. 
EXO.9.35	Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not let the Israelites go, just as the L
EXO.10.1	Then the L
EXO.10.2	and that you may recount 
EXO.10.3	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, “Thus says the L
EXO.10.4	For if you refuse to let My people go, then hear this: tomorrow I will bring [migratory] locusts into your country. 
EXO.10.5	They shall cover the [visible] surface of the land, so that no one will be able to see the ground, and they will eat the rest of what has remained—that is, the 
EXO.10.6	your houses and those of all your servants and of all the Egyptians shall be filled 
EXO.10.7	Pharaoh’s servants said to him, “How long shall this man be a trap to us? Let the men go, so that they may serve the L
EXO.10.8	So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, “Go, serve the L
EXO.10.9	Moses said, “We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds [all of us and all that we have], for we must hold a feast to the L
EXO.10.10	Pharaoh said to them, “The L
EXO.10.11	No! Go now, you who are men, [without your families] and serve the L
EXO.10.12	Then the L
EXO.10.13	So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the L
EXO.10.14	The locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled down in the whole territory, a very dreadful mass of them; never before were there such locusts as these, nor will there ever be again. 
EXO.10.15	For they covered the [visible] surface of the land, so that the ground was darkened; and they ate every plant of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. There remained not a green thing on the trees or the plants of the field throughout all the land of Egypt. 
EXO.10.16	Then Pharaoh hurried to call for Moses and Aaron, and he said, “I have sinned against the L
EXO.10.17	Now therefore, please forgive my sin only this once [more], and pray 
EXO.10.18	Moses left Pharaoh and entreated the L
EXO.10.19	So the L
EXO.10.20	But the L
EXO.10.21	Then the L
EXO.10.22	So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and for three days a thick darkness was all over the land of Egypt [no sun, no moon, no stars]. 
EXO.10.23	The Egyptians could not see one another, nor did anyone leave his place for three days, but all the Israelites had [supernatural] light in their dwellings. 
EXO.10.24	Then Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, “Go, serve the L
EXO.10.25	But Moses said, “You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings, so that we may sacrifice them to the L
EXO.10.26	Therefore, our livestock must also go with us; not one hoof shall be left behind, for we must take some of them to serve the L
EXO.10.27	But the L
EXO.10.28	Then Pharaoh said to Moses, “Get away from me! See that you never enter my presence again, for on the day that you see my face again you will die!” 
EXO.10.29	Then Moses said, “You are correct; I will never see your face again!”
EXO.11.1	Then the L
EXO.11.2	Speak so that all of the people [of Israel] may hear, and tell every man to ask from his neighbor, and every woman to ask from her neighbor, articles of silver, and articles of gold.” 
EXO.11.3	The L
EXO.11.4	Then Moses said, “Thus says the L
EXO.11.5	and all the firstborn in the land [the pride, hope, and joy] of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, to the firstborn of the slave girl who is behind the hand-mill, and all the firstborn of cattle as well. 
EXO.11.6	There shall be a great cry [of heartache and sorrow] throughout the land of Egypt, such as has never been before and such as shall never be again. 
EXO.11.7	But not even a dog will 
EXO.11.8	All these servants of yours will come down to me and bow down before me, saying, ‘Get out, you and all the people who follow you.’ After that I will leave.” And he left Pharaoh in the heat of anger.
EXO.11.9	Then the L
EXO.11.10	Moses and Aaron did all these wonders (miracles) before Pharaoh; yet the L
EXO.12.1	The L
EXO.12.2	“This 
EXO.12.3	Tell all the congregation of Israel, ‘On the tenth [day] of this month they are to take a lamb 
EXO.12.4	Now if the household is too small for a lamb [to be consumed], let him and his next door neighbor take one according to the number of people [in the households]; according to what each man can eat, you are to divide the lamb. 
EXO.12.5	Your lamb 
EXO.12.6	You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month, then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel is to slaughter it 
EXO.12.7	Moreover, they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel [above the door] of the houses in which they eat it. 
EXO.12.8	They shall eat the meat that same night, roasted in fire, and they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. 
EXO.12.9	Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted in fire—both its head and its legs, along with its inner parts. 
EXO.12.10	You shall let none of the meat remain until the morning, and anything that remains left over until morning, you shall burn completely in the fire. 
EXO.12.11	Now you are to eat it in this manner: [be prepared for a journey] with your

EXO.12.13	The blood shall be a sign for you on [the doorposts of] the houses where you live; when I see the blood I shall pass over you, and no affliction shall happen to you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.
EXO.12.14	‘Now this day will be a memorial to you, and you shall keep it as a feast to the L
EXO.12.15	[In the celebration of the Passover in future years,] seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, but on the first day you shall remove the 
EXO.12.16	On the first day [of the feast] you shall have a holy 
EXO.12.17	You shall also observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread, because on this very day I brought your hosts [grouped according to tribal armies] out of the land of Egypt; therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations as an ordinance forever. 
EXO.12.18	In the first 
EXO.12.19	Seven days no leaven shall be found in your houses; whoever eats what is leavened shall be cut off 
EXO.12.20	You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your dwellings you shall eat unleavened bread.’ ”
EXO.12.21	Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go and take a lamb for yourselves according to [the size of] your families and slaughter the Passover 
EXO.12.22	You shall take a bunch of 
EXO.12.23	For the L
EXO.12.24	You shall observe this event [concerning Passover] as an ordinance for you and for your children forever. 
EXO.12.25	When you enter the land which the L
EXO.12.26	When your children say to you, ‘What does this service mean to you?’ 
EXO.12.27	you shall say, ‘It is the sacrifice of the L
EXO.12.28	Then the Israelites went and did [as they had been told]: just as the L
EXO.12.29	Now it happened at midnight that the L
EXO.12.30	Pharaoh got up in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians, and there was a great cry [of heartache and sorrow] in Egypt, for there was no house where there was not someone dead. 
EXO.12.31	Then he called for Moses and Aaron at night and said, “Get up, get out from among my people, both you and the Israelites; and go, serve the L
EXO.12.32	Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and go, and [ask your God to] bless me also.”
EXO.12.33	The Egyptians [anxiously] urged the people [to leave], to send them out of the land quickly, for they said, “We will all be dead.” 
EXO.12.34	So the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading bowls being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders.
EXO.12.35	Now the Israelites had acted in accordance with the word of Moses; and they had asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing. 
EXO.12.36	The L
EXO.12.37	Now the Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides [the women and] the children. 
EXO.12.38	A mixed multitude [of non-Israelites from foreign nations] also went with them, along with both flocks and herds, a very large number of livestock. 
EXO.12.39	And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought from Egypt; it was not leavened, since they were driven [quickly] from Egypt and could not delay, nor had they prepared any food for themselves.
EXO.12.40	Now the period of time the children of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years. 
EXO.12.41	At the end of the four hundred and thirty years, to that very day, all the hosts of the L
EXO.12.42	It is a night of watching to be observed for the L
EXO.12.43	The L
EXO.12.44	but every man’s slave who is bought with money, after you have circumcised him, then he may eat it. 
EXO.12.45	No stranger (temporary resident, foreigner) or hired servant shall eat it. 
EXO.12.46	It is to be eaten inside one house; you shall not take any of the meat outside the house, nor shall you break any of its bones. 
EXO.12.47	The entire congregation of Israel shall keep 
EXO.12.48	If a stranger living temporarily among you wishes to celebrate the Passover to the L
EXO.12.49	The same law shall apply to the native-born and to the stranger who lives temporarily among you.”
EXO.12.50	Then all the Israelites did so; they did just as the L
EXO.12.51	And on that very same day the L
EXO.13.1	The L
EXO.13.2	“Sanctify to Me [that is, set apart for My purpose] every firstborn, the first offspring of every womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of animal; it is Mine.”
EXO.13.3	Moses said to the people, “Remember [solemnly observe and commemorate] this day on which you came out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage 
EXO.13.4	On this day in the month Abib, you are about to go onward. 
EXO.13.5	And it shall be when the L
EXO.13.6	For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the L
EXO.13.7	Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; no leavened bread shall be seen with you, nor shall there be leaven within the borders of your territory. 
EXO.13.8	You shall explain this to your son on that day, saying, ‘It is because of what the L
EXO.13.9	It shall serve as a sign to you on your hand (arm), and as a reminder on your forehead, so that the instruction (law) of the L

EXO.13.11	“Now it shall be when the L
EXO.13.12	you shall set apart 
EXO.13.13	Every firstborn of a

EXO.13.15	For it happened, when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, that the L
EXO.13.16	So it shall serve as a sign 
EXO.13.17	So it happened, when Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, even though it was nearer; for God said, “The people might change their minds when they see war [that is, that there will be war], and return to Egypt.” 
EXO.13.18	But God led the people around by the way of the wilderness toward the 
EXO.13.19	Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for Joseph had solemnly ordered (placed under an oath) the Israelites, saying, “God will assuredly take care of you, and you must carry my bones away from here with you.” 
EXO.13.20	They journeyed from Succoth [in Goshen] and camped at Etham on the edge of the wilderness. 
EXO.13.21	The [presence of the] L
EXO.13.22	He did not withdraw the pillar of cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from going before the people.
EXO.14.1	Now the L
EXO.14.2	“Tell the sons of Israel to turn back and camp in front of Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. You shall camp in front of Baal-zephon, opposite it, by the sea. 
EXO.14.3	For Pharaoh will say of the Israelites, ‘They are wandering aimlessly in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.’ 
EXO.14.4	I will harden (make stubborn, defiant) Pharaoh’s heart, so that he will pursue them; and I will be glorified 
EXO.14.5	When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his servants had a change of heart toward the people, and they said, “What is this that we have done? We have let Israel go from serving us!” 
EXO.14.6	So Pharaoh harnessed 
EXO.14.7	and he took six hundred chosen war-chariots, and all the other war-chariots of Egypt with 
EXO.14.8	The L
EXO.14.9	The Egyptians chased them with all the horses and war-chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen and his army, and they overtook them as they camped by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon.
EXO.14.10	As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up and saw the Egyptians marching after them, and they were very frightened; so the Israelites cried out to the L
EXO.14.11	Then they said to Moses, “Is it because there are no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What is this that you have done to us by bringing us out of Egypt? 
EXO.14.12	Did we not say to you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians?’ For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians [as slaves] than to die in the wilderness.”
EXO.14.13	Then Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid! Take your stand [be firm and confident and undismayed] and see the salvation of the L
EXO.14.14	The L
EXO.14.15	The L
EXO.14.16	As for you, lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, so that the sons of Israel may go through the middle of the sea on dry land. 
EXO.14.17	As for Me, hear this: I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they will go in [the sea] after them; and I will be glorified 
EXO.14.18	And the Egyptians shall know [without any doubt] 
EXO.14.19	The 
EXO.14.20	So it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. It was a cloud along with darkness [even by day to the Egyptians], but it gave light by night [to the Israelites]; so one [army] did not come near the other all night.
EXO.14.21	Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the L
EXO.14.22	The Israelites went into the middle of the sea on dry land, and the waters formed a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. 
EXO.14.23	Then the Egyptians pursued them into the middle of the sea, even all Pharaoh’s horses, his war-chariots and his charioteers. 
EXO.14.24	So it happened at the early morning watch [before dawn], that the L
EXO.14.25	He made their chariot wheels hard to turn, and the chariots difficult to drive; so the Egyptians said, “Let us flee from Israel, for the L
EXO.14.26	Then the L
EXO.14.27	So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its normal flow at sunrise; and the Egyptians retreated right into it [being met by the returning water]; so the L
EXO.14.28	The waters returned and covered the chariots and the charioteers, and all the army of Pharaoh that had gone into the sea after them; not even one of them survived. 
EXO.14.29	But the Israelites walked on dry land in the middle of the sea, and the waters formed a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
EXO.14.30	The L
EXO.14.31	When Israel saw the great power which the L
EXO.15.1	Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this 
EXO.15.1	“I will sing to the L
EXO.15.1	The horse and its rider He has thrown into the sea.
EXO.15.2	The L
EXO.15.2	And He has become my salvation;
EXO.15.2	This is my God, and I will praise Him;
EXO.15.2	My father’s God, and I will exalt Him.
EXO.15.3	The L
EXO.15.3	The L
EXO.15.4	Pharaoh’s chariots and his army He has thrown into the sea;
EXO.15.4	His chosen captains are drowned in the 
EXO.15.5	The deep [water] covers them;
EXO.15.5	[Clad in armor] they sank into the depths like a stone.
EXO.15.6	Your right hand, O L
EXO.15.6	Your right hand, O L
EXO.15.7	In the greatness of Your majesty You overthrow 
EXO.15.7	You send out Your fury, and it consumes them like chaff.
EXO.15.8	With the blast of Your nostrils the waters piled up,
EXO.15.8	The flowing waters stood up like a mound;
EXO.15.8	The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.
EXO.15.9	The enemy said, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil;
EXO.15.9	My desire shall be satisfied against them;
EXO.15.9	I will draw my sword, my hand shall dispossess them 
EXO.15.10	You blew with Your wind, the sea covered them;
EXO.15.10	[Clad in armor] they sank like lead in the mighty waters.
EXO.15.11	Who is like You among the gods, O L
EXO.15.11	Who is like You, majestic in holiness,
EXO.15.11	Awesome in splendor, working wonders?
EXO.15.12	You stretched out Your right hand,
EXO.15.12	The 
EXO.15.13	You in Your lovingkindness 
EXO.15.13	In Your strength You have guided them with care to Your holy habitation.
EXO.15.14	The peoples have heard [about You], they tremble;
EXO.15.14	Anguish 
EXO.15.15	Then the [tribal] chiefs of Edom were dismayed 
EXO.15.15	The [mighty] leaders of Moab, trembling grips them;
EXO.15.15	All the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away [in despair]—
EXO.15.16	Terror and dread fall on them;
EXO.15.16	Because of the greatness of Your arm they are as still as a stone;
EXO.15.16	Until Your people pass by 
EXO.15.16	Until the people pass by whom You have purchased.
EXO.15.17	You will bring them [into the land of promise] and plant them on the mountain (Mt. Moriah in Jerusalem) of Your inheritance,
EXO.15.17	The place, O L
EXO.15.17	The sanctuary, O Lord, which Your hands have established.
EXO.15.18	The L
EXO.15.19	For the horses of Pharaoh went with his war-chariots and his charioteers into the sea, and the L
EXO.15.20	Then Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron [and Moses], took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women followed her with timbrels and dancing. 
EXO.15.21	Miriam answered them,
EXO.15.21	“Sing to the L
EXO.15.21	The horse and its rider He has hurled into the sea.”
EXO.15.22	Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea, and they went into the Wilderness of Shur; they went [a distance of] three days (about thirty-three miles) in the wilderness and found no water. 
EXO.15.23	Then they came to Marah, but they could not drink its waters because they were 
EXO.15.24	The people [grew discontented and] grumbled at Moses, saying, “What are we going to drink?” 
EXO.15.25	Then he cried to the L
EXO.15.26	saying, “If you will diligently listen 
EXO.15.27	Then the children of Israel came to Elim where there were twelve springs of water and seventy date palms, and they camped there beside the waters.
EXO.16.1	They set out from Elim, and all the congregation of Israel came to the Wilderness of 
EXO.16.2	The whole congregation of the Israelites [grew discontented and] murmured 
EXO.16.3	and the Israelites said to them, “
EXO.16.4	Then the L
EXO.16.5	And it shall be that on the sixth day, they shall prepare to bring in twice as much as they gather daily [so that they will not need to gather on the seventh day].” 
EXO.16.6	So Moses and Aaron said to all Israel, “At evening you shall know that the L
EXO.16.7	and in the morning you will see the glory of the L
EXO.16.8	Moses said, “
EXO.16.9	Then Moses said to Aaron, “Say to all the congregation of Israel, ‘Approach the L
EXO.16.10	So it happened that as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory 
EXO.16.11	Then the L
EXO.16.12	“I have heard the murmurings of the Israelites; speak to them, saying, ‘At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread; and you shall know that I am the L
EXO.16.13	So in the evening the quails came up and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a blanket of dew around the camp. 
EXO.16.14	When the layer of dew evaporated, on the surface of the wilderness there was a fine, flake-like thing, as fine as frost on the ground. 
EXO.16.15	When the Israelites saw it, they said to one another, “
EXO.16.16	This is what the L
EXO.16.17	The Israelites did so, and some gathered much [of it] and some [only a] little. 
EXO.16.18	When they measured it with an omer, he who had gathered a large amount had no excess, and he who had gathered little had no lack; every man gathered according to his need (family size). 
EXO.16.19	Moses said, “Let none of it be left [overnight] until [the next] morning.” 
EXO.16.20	But they did not listen to Moses, and some left a supply of it until morning, and it bred worms and became foul 
EXO.16.21	So they gathered it every morning, each as much as he needed, because when the sun was hot it melted.
EXO.16.22	Now on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each person; and all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses. 
EXO.16.23	He said to them, “This is what the L
EXO.16.24	They put it aside until morning, as Moses told them, and it did not become foul nor was it wormy. 
EXO.16.25	Then Moses said, “Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to the L
EXO.16.26	Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will be none [in the field].”
EXO.16.27	Now on the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, but they found none. 
EXO.16.28	Then the L
EXO.16.29	See, the L
EXO.16.30	So the people rested on the seventh day.
EXO.16.31	The house of Israel called the bread manna; it was like coriander seed, white, and it tasted like flat pastry (wafers) made with honey. 
EXO.16.32	Then Moses said, “This is the word which the L
EXO.16.33	So Moses said to Aaron, “Take a pot and put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the L
EXO.16.34	As the L
EXO.16.35	The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they reached an inhabited land; they ate the manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan. 
EXO.16.36	(Now an 
EXO.17.1	Then all the congregation of the children of Israel moved on from the Wilderness of Sin by stages, according to the commandment of the L
EXO.17.2	Therefore the people quarreled with Moses and said, “Give us water so we may [have something to] drink.” And Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you tempt the L
EXO.17.3	But the people were thirsty for water; and the people murmured against Moses and said, “Why did you bring us up from Egypt to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?” 
EXO.17.4	So Moses cried out to the L
EXO.17.5	Then the L
EXO.17.6	Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at 
EXO.17.7	He named the place [where this miracle occurred] Massah (test) and 
EXO.17.8	Then 
EXO.17.9	So Moses said to 
EXO.17.10	So Joshua did as Moses said, and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and 
EXO.17.11	Now when Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed, and when he lowered his hand [due to fatigue], Amalek prevailed. 
EXO.17.12	But Moses’ hands were heavy 
EXO.17.13	So Joshua overwhelmed 
EXO.17.14	Then the L
EXO.17.15	And Moses built an altar and named it 
EXO.17.16	saying, “The L
EXO.18.1	Now Jethro (Reuel), the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel His people, and that the L
EXO.18.2	Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took Moses’ wife Zipporah, after he had sent her away [from Egypt], 
EXO.18.3	along with her two sons, of whom one was named Gershom (stranger), for Moses said, “I have been a stranger in a foreign land.” 
EXO.18.4	The other [son] was named Eliezer (my God is help), for 
EXO.18.5	Then Jethro, his father-in-law, came with Moses’ sons and his wife to [join] Moses in the wilderness where he was camped, at the mountain of God [that is, Mt. Sinai in Horeb]. 
EXO.18.6	He sent a message to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons [who are] with her.” 
EXO.18.7	So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and he bowed down [in respect] and kissed him. They asked each other about their well-being and went into the tent. 
EXO.18.8	Moses told his father-in-law about all that the L
EXO.18.9	Jethro rejoiced over all the good things the L
EXO.18.10	Jethro said, “Blessed be the L
EXO.18.11	Now I know that the L
EXO.18.12	Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and [other] sacrifices [to offer] to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal with Moses’ father-in-law before God.
EXO.18.13	Now the next day Moses sat to judge [the disputes] the people [had with one another], and the people stood around Moses from dawn to dusk. 
EXO.18.14	When Moses’ father-in-law saw everything that he was doing for the people, he said, “What is this that you are doing for the people? Why are you sitting alone [as a judge] with all the people standing around you from dawn to dusk?” 
EXO.18.15	Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to ask [about the will] of God. 
EXO.18.16	When they have a dispute they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor and I make known the statutes of God and His laws.”
EXO.18.17	Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “The thing that you are doing is not good. 
EXO.18.18	You will certainly wear out both yourself and these people who are with you, because the task is too heavy for you [to bear]; you cannot do it alone. 
EXO.18.19	Now listen to 
EXO.18.20	You shall teach them the decrees and laws. You shall show them the way they are to live and the work they are to do. 
EXO.18.21	Furthermore, you shall select from all the people competent men who [reverently] fear God, men of truth, those who hate dishonest gain; you shall place these over the people as leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens. 
EXO.18.22	They shall judge the people at all times; have them bring every major dispute to you, but let them judge every minor dispute themselves. So it will be easier for you, and they will bear 
EXO.18.23	If you will do this thing and God so commands you, then you will be able to endure [the responsibility], and all these people will also go [back] to their tents in peace.”
EXO.18.24	So Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything that he had said. 
EXO.18.25	Moses chose able men from all Israel and made them heads over the people, leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens [from the highest to the lowest judicial levels]. 
EXO.18.26	And they judged the people at all times; they would bring the difficult cases to Moses, but every minor dispute they judged 
EXO.18.27	Then Moses 
EXO.19.1	In the third month after the children of Israel had left the land of Egypt, the very same day, they came into the Wilderness of Sinai. 
EXO.19.2	When they moved out from Rephidim, they came to the Wilderness of Sinai and they camped there; Israel camped at the base of the mountain [of Sinai]. 
EXO.19.3	Moses went up to God [on the mountain], and the L
EXO.19.4	‘You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I carried you on eagles’ wings, and brought you to Myself. 
EXO.19.5	Now therefore, if you will in fact obey My voice and keep My covenant (agreement), then you shall be My own special possession 
EXO.19.6	and you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation [set apart for My purpose].’ These are the words that you shall speak to the Israelites.”
EXO.19.7	So Moses called for the elders of the people, and told them all these words which the L
EXO.19.8	All the people answered together and said, “We will do everything that the L

EXO.19.10	The L
EXO.19.11	and be ready by the third day, because on the third day the L
EXO.19.12	You shall set barriers for the people all around [the mountain], saying, ‘Beware that you do not go up on the mountain or touch its border; whoever touches the mountain must be put to death. 
EXO.19.13	No hand shall touch him [that is, no one shall try to save the guilty party], but the offender must be stoned or shot through [with arrows]; whether man or animal [that touches the mountain], he shall not live.’ When the ram’s horn sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain.” 
EXO.19.14	So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and sanctified them [for God’s sacred purpose], and they washed their clothes. 
EXO.19.15	He said to the people, “Be prepared for the third day; do not 
EXO.19.16	So it happened on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunder and flashes of lightning, and a thick cloud was on the mountain, and a very loud blast was sounded on a ram’s horn, so that all the people who were in the camp trembled. 
EXO.19.17	Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood 
EXO.19.18	Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because the L
EXO.19.19	And it happened, as the blast of the ram’s horn grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him with [a voice of] thunder.

EXO.19.23	Moses said to the L
EXO.19.24	Then the L
EXO.19.25	So Moses went down to the people and told them [again about God’s warning].
EXO.20.1	Then God spoke all these words:
EXO.20.2	“I am the L
EXO.20.3	“You shall have no other gods before Me.
EXO.20.4	“You shall not make for yourself any idol, or any likeness (form, manifestation) of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth [as an object to worship].

EXO.20.7	“You shall not take the name of the L
EXO.20.8	“Remember the Sabbath (seventh) day to keep it holy (set apart, dedicated to God).

EXO.20.11	For in six days the L

EXO.20.17	“You shall not covet [that is, selfishly desire and attempt to acquire] your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his male servant, or his female servant, or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”
EXO.20.18	Now all the people witnessed the thunder and the flashes of lightning and the sound of the trumpet and the smoking mountain; and as they looked, the people were afraid, and they trembled [and moved backward] and stood at a [safe] distance. 
EXO.20.19	Then they said to Moses, “You speak to us and we will listen, but do not let God speak to us or we will die.” 
EXO.20.20	Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid; for God has come in order to test you, and in order that the fear of Him [that is, a profound reverence for Him] will remain with you, so that you do not sin.” 
EXO.20.21	So the people stood at a [safe] distance, but Moses approached the thick cloud where God was.
EXO.20.22	Then the L
EXO.20.23	You shall not make 
EXO.20.24	You shall make an altar of earth for Me, and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen. In every place where I cause My Name to be recorded 
EXO.20.25	If you make an altar of stone for Me, you shall not build it of cut stones, for if you use a chisel on it, you will

EXO.21.1	“Now these are the ordinances (laws) which you shall set before the Israelites:

EXO.21.3	If he came [to you] alone, he shall leave alone; if he came married, then his wife shall leave with him. 
EXO.21.4	If his master gives him a wife, and she gives birth to sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall belong to her master, and he shall leave [your service] alone. 
EXO.21.5	But if the servant plainly says, ‘I love my master, my wife and my children; I will not leave as a free man,’ 
EXO.21.6	then his master shall bring him to God [that is, to the judges who act in God’s name], then he shall bring him to the door or doorpost. And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl (strong needle); and he shall serve him for life.
EXO.21.7	“If a man sells his daughter to be a female servant, she shall not go free [after six years] as male servants do. 
EXO.21.8	If she does not please her master who has chosen her for himself [as a wife], he shall let her be redeemed [by her family]. He does not have the authority to sell her to a foreign people, because he has been unfair to her. 
EXO.21.9	If her master chooses her [as a wife] for his son, he shall act toward her as if she were legally his daughter. 
EXO.21.10	If her master marries another wife, he may not reduce her food, her clothing, or her privilege as a wife. 
EXO.21.11	If he does not do these three things for her, then shall she leave free, without

EXO.21.20	“If a man strikes his male or his female servant with a staff and the servant dies at his hand, he must be punished. 
EXO.21.21	If, however, the servant survives for a day or two, the offender shall not be punished, for the [injured] servant is his own property.

EXO.21.27	And if he knocks out the tooth of his male servant or female servant, he must let the servant go free because of [the loss of] the tooth.
EXO.21.28	“If an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox must be stoned and its meat shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be cleared [of responsibility]. 
EXO.21.29	But if the ox has tried to gore on a previous occasion, and its owner has been warned, but has not kept it confined and it kills a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned and its owner shall be put to death as well. 
EXO.21.30	If a ransom is demanded of him [in return for his life], then he shall give whatever is demanded for the redemption of his life. 
EXO.21.31	If the ox has gored another’s son or daughter, he shall be dealt with according to this same rule. 
EXO.21.32	If the ox gores a male or a female servant, the owner shall give to the servant’s master thirty shekels of silver [the purchase price for a slave], and the ox shall be stoned.

EXO.22.3	But if the sun has risen, there will be bloodguilt for him. The thief [if he lives] must make [full] restitution; if he has nothing, then he shall be sold [as a slave to make restitution] for his theft. 
EXO.22.4	If the animal that he stole is found alive in his possession, whether it is ox or donkey or sheep, he shall pay double [for it].
EXO.22.5	“If a man causes a field or vineyard to be grazed bare or lets his livestock loose so that it grazes in another man’s field, he shall make restitution from the best of his own field and the best of his own vineyard.
EXO.22.6	“If fire breaks out and spreads to thorn bushes so that the stacked grain or standing grain or the field is consumed, he who started the fire shall make full restitution.
EXO.22.7	“If a man gives his neighbor money or [other] goods to keep [for him while he is away] and it is stolen from the neighbor’s house, then, if the thief is caught, he shall pay double [for it]. 
EXO.22.8	If the thief is not caught, the owner of the house shall appear before the judges [who act in God’s name], to determine whether or not he had stolen his neighbor’s goods. 
EXO.22.9	For every offense involving property, whether it concerns ox, donkey, sheep, clothing, or any piece of lost property, which another identifies as his, the case of both parties shall come before the judges [who act in God’s name]. Whomever the judges pronounce guilty shall pay double to his neighbor.

EXO.22.14	“And if a man borrows an animal from his neighbor, and it gets injured or dies while its owner is not with it, the borrower shall make full restitution. 
EXO.22.15	But if the owner is with it [when the damage is done], the borrower shall not make restitution. If it was hired, the damage is included in [the price of] its fee.

EXO.32.7	Then the L
EXO.32.8	They have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them. They have made themselves a molten calf, and have worshiped it and sacrificed to it, and said, ‘This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!’ ”

EXO.32.13	Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel (Jacob), Your servants to whom You swore [an oath] by Yourself, and said to them, ‘I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heavens, and all this land of which I have spoken I will give to your descendants, and they shall inherit it forever.’ ”

EXO.32.16	The tablets were the work of God; the writing was the writing of God engraved on the tablets. 
EXO.32.17	Now when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “There is a sound of battle in the camp.” 
EXO.32.18	But Moses said,
EXO.32.18	“It is not the sound of the cry of victory,
EXO.32.18	Nor is it the sound of the cry of defeat;
EXO.32.18	But I hear the sound of singing.”

EXO.32.20	Then Moses took the calf they had made and burned it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and scattered it on the surface of the water and made the Israelites drink it.
EXO.32.21	Then Moses said to Aaron, “What did this people do to you, that you have brought so great a sin on them?” 
EXO.32.22	Aaron said, “Do not let the anger of my lord burn; you know the people yourself, that they are prone to evil. 
EXO.32.23	For they said to me, ‘Make us a god who will go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.’ 
EXO.32.24	I said to them, ‘Let whoever has gold [jewelry], take it off.’ So they gave it to me; then I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf.”
EXO.32.25	Now when Moses saw that the people were out of control—for Aaron had let them get out of control to the point of being an object of mockery among their enemies— 
EXO.32.26	then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, “Whoever is on the L
EXO.32.27	He said to them, “Thus says the L
EXO.32.28	So the sons of Levi did as Moses instructed, and about three thousand men of the people [of Israel] were killed that day. 
EXO.32.29	Then Moses said [to the Levites], “Dedicate yourselves today to the L
EXO.32.30	Then the next day Moses said to the people, “You have committed a great sin. Now I will go up to the L
EXO.32.31	So Moses returned to the L
EXO.32.32	Yet now, if You will, forgive their sin—and if not, please blot me out of Your book which You have written (kill me)!” 
EXO.32.33	But the L
EXO.32.34	But now go, lead the people [to the place] where I have told you. Behold, My 
EXO.32.35	So the L
EXO.33.1	The L
EXO.33.2	I will send an Angel before you and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
EXO.33.3	Go up to a land [of abundance] 
EXO.33.4	When the people heard this sad word, they mourned, and none of them put on his ornaments. 
EXO.33.5	For the L
EXO.33.6	So the Israelites left off all their ornaments [in repentance], from Mount Horeb (Sinai) 
EXO.33.7	Now Moses used to take his own tent and pitch it outside the camp, far away from the camp, and he called it the tent of meeting [of God with His own people]. And everyone who sought the L
EXO.33.8	Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise and stand, each at his tent door, and look at Moses until he entered the tent. 
EXO.33.9	Whenever Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the doorway of the tent; and the L
EXO.33.10	When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the tent door, all the people would rise and worship, each at his tent door. 
EXO.33.11	And so the L
EXO.33.12	Moses said to the L
EXO.33.13	Now therefore, I pray you, if I have found favor in Your sight, let me know Your ways so that I may know You [becoming more deeply and intimately acquainted with You, recognizing and understanding Your ways more clearly] and that I may find grace 
EXO.33.14	And the L
EXO.33.15	And Moses said to Him, “If Your presence does not go [with me], do not lead us up from here. 
EXO.33.16	For how then can it be known that Your people and I have found favor in Your sight? Is it not by Your going with us, so that we are distinguished, Your people and I, from all the [other] people on the face of the earth?”
EXO.33.17	The L
EXO.33.18	Then Moses said, “Please, show me Your glory!” 
EXO.33.19	And God said, “I will make all My goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the Name of the L
EXO.33.20	But He said, “You cannot see My face, for no man shall see Me and live!” 
EXO.33.21	Then the L
EXO.33.22	and while My glory is passing by, I will put you in a cleft of the rock and 
EXO.33.23	Then I will take away My hand and you shall see My back; but My face shall not be seen.”
EXO.34.1	Then the L
EXO.34.2	So be ready by morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to Me on the top of the mountain. 
EXO.34.3	No man is to come up with you, nor let any man be seen anywhere on the mountain; nor let flocks or herds feed in front of that mountain.” 
EXO.34.4	So Moses cut two tablets of stone like the first ones, and he got up early in the morning and went up on Mount Sinai, as the L
EXO.34.5	Then the L
EXO.34.6	Then the L
EXO.34.7	keeping mercy 
EXO.34.8	Moses bowed to the earth immediately and worshiped [the Lord]. 
EXO.34.9	And he said, “If now I have found favor 
EXO.34.10	Then God said, “Behold, I am going to make a covenant. Before all your people I will do wondrous works (miracles) such as have not been created 
EXO.34.11	“Be sure to observe what I am commanding you this day: behold, I am going to drive out the Amorite before you, and the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
EXO.34.12	Watch yourself so that you do not make a covenant (solemn agreement, treaty) with the inhabitants of the land into which you are going, or it will become a [dangerous] trap among you. 
EXO.34.13	But you shall tear down 
EXO.34.14	—for you shall not worship any other god; for the L
EXO.34.15	otherwise you might make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they would play the prostitute with their gods and sacrifice to their gods, and someone might invite you 
EXO.34.16	and you might take some of his daughters for your sons, and his daughters would play the prostitute with their gods and cause your sons also to play the prostitute (commit apostasy) with their gods [that is, abandon the true God for man-made idols]. 
EXO.34.17	You shall make for yourselves no molten gods.
EXO.34.18	“You shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread (Passover). For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I have commanded you, at the appointed time in the month of Abib; for in the month of Abib you came out of Egypt.
EXO.34.19	“All the firstborn males among your livestock belong to Me, whether cattle or sheep. 
EXO.34.20	You shall redeem the firstborn of a donkey with a lamb; but if you do not redeem it, then you shall break its neck. You shall redeem all the firstborn of your sons. None of you are to appear before Me empty-handed.
EXO.34.21	“You shall work for six days, but on the seventh day you shall rest; [even] in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest [on the Sabbath]. 
EXO.34.22	You shall observe 
EXO.34.23	Three times a year all your males shall appear before the Lord 
EXO.34.24	For I will drive out 
EXO.34.25	“You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread, nor shall the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover (Unleavened Bread) be left over until morning.
EXO.34.26	“You shall bring the very first of the first fruits of your ground to the house of the L
EXO.34.26	“
EXO.34.27	Then the L
EXO.34.28	Moses was there with the L
EXO.34.29	When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hand, he did not know that the skin of his face was shining [with a unique radiance] because he had been speaking with God. 
EXO.34.30	When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to approach him. 
EXO.34.31	But Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him; and he spoke to them. 
EXO.34.32	Afterward all the Israelites approached him, and he commanded them to do everything that the L
EXO.34.33	When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face. 
EXO.34.34	But whenever Moses went in before the L
EXO.34.35	the Israelites would see the face of Moses, how his skin shone [with a unique radiance]. So Moses put the veil on his face again until he went in to speak with God.
EXO.35.1	Moses gathered all the congregation of the sons of Israel together, and said to them, “These are the things which the L
EXO.35.2	“For six days work may be done, but the seventh day shall be a holy day for you, a Sabbath of complete rest to the L
EXO.35.3	You shall not kindle a fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day.”
EXO.35.4	And Moses said to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, “This is the thing which the L
EXO.35.5	‘Take from among you an offering to the L
EXO.35.6	blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, fine linen, goats’ 
EXO.35.7	and 
EXO.35.8	and [olive] oil for the lighting, and balsam for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense, 
EXO.35.9	and 
EXO.35.10	‘Let every skilled

EXO.35.12	the ark [of the covenant] and its carrying poles, with the 
EXO.35.13	the table and its carrying poles, and all its utensils, and the bread of the [divine] Presence (showbread); 
EXO.35.14	the lampstand also for the light and its utensils and its lamps, and the oil for the light; 
EXO.35.15	and the altar of incense and its carrying poles, the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, the screen (curtain) for the doorway at the entrance of the tabernacle; 
EXO.35.16	the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, its carrying poles, and all its utensils, the wash basin and its base (stand); 
EXO.35.17	the court’s curtains, its support poles and their sockets, and the curtain for the gate of the courtyard; 
EXO.35.18	the pegs of the tabernacle and the pegs of the court and their cords; 
EXO.35.19	the finely-woven garments for ministering in the Holy Place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons, to minister as priests.’ ”
EXO.35.20	Then all the congregation of the Israelites left Moses’ presence. 
EXO.35.21	Everyone whose heart stirred him and everyone whose spirit moved him came and brought the L
EXO.35.22	Then all whose hearts moved them, both men and women, came and brought brooches, earrings 
EXO.35.23	Every man who had in his possession blue or purple or scarlet fabric, and fine linen, and goats’ 
EXO.35.24	Everyone who could make an offering of silver or bronze brought it as the L
EXO.35.25	All the skilled 
EXO.35.26	All the women whose heart stirred with a skill spun the goats’ 
EXO.35.27	The leaders brought onyx stones and other stones to be put in settings for the ephod and for the breastpiece, 
EXO.35.28	and spice and [olive] oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense. 
EXO.35.29	The Israelites, all the men and women whose heart moved them to bring 
EXO.35.30	Then Moses said to the Israelites, “See, the L
EXO.35.31	and He has filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom 
EXO.35.32	to devise artistic designs to work in gold, silver, and bronze, 
EXO.35.33	and in the cutting of stones for setting and in the carving of wood, for work in every skilled craft. 
EXO.35.34	He has also put in Bezalel’s heart [the willingness] to teach [others the same skills], both he and Oholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. 
EXO.35.35	He has filled them with skill to do the work of an engraver, of a designer, and of an embroiderer, in blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, and in fine linen, and of a weaver; makers of every work and embroiderers of [excellent] designs.
EXO.36.1	“Bezalel and Oholiab, and every skilled person in whom the L
EXO.36.2	So Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every skilled person in whom the L
EXO.36.3	They received from Moses all the offerings which the Israelites had brought for the construction of the sanctuary, to prepare it for service. And they continued to bring him freewill (voluntary) offerings every morning. 
EXO.36.4	And all the skilled men who were doing all the work on the sanctuary came, each one from the work which he was doing, 
EXO.36.5	and they said to Moses, “The people are bringing much more than enough for the construction work which the L
EXO.36.6	So Moses issued a command, and it was proclaimed throughout the camp, “Let neither man nor woman do any more work for the sanctuary offering.” So the people were restrained from bringing 
EXO.36.7	for the material they had was sufficient and more than enough to do all the work.
EXO.36.8	All the skilled men among them who were doing the work on the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twisted linen and blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, with cherubim [worked into them], the work of an embroiderer, Bezalel made them. 
EXO.36.9	Each curtain was twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide; all the curtains were one size. 
EXO.36.10	Bezalel joined five curtains one to another, and [the other] five curtains he joined one to another. 
EXO.36.11	He made loops of blue on the edge of the outermost curtain in the first set; he also did this on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the second set. 
EXO.36.12	He made fifty loops in the one curtain [of the first set] and fifty loops on the edge of the curtain which was in the second set; the loops were opposite one another. 
EXO.36.13	He made fifty gold hooks and joined the curtains together with the hooks, so that the tabernacle became a unit.
EXO.36.14	Then he made curtains of goats’ 
EXO.36.15	Each curtain was thirty cubits long and four cubits wide; the eleven curtains were of equal size. 
EXO.36.16	Bezalel joined five curtains by themselves and [the other] six curtains by themselves. 
EXO.36.17	He made fifty loops on the edge of the outermost curtain in the 
EXO.36.18	He made fifty bronze hooks to join the tent together into a unit. 
EXO.36.19	He made a [third] covering for the tent of rams’ 
EXO.36.20	Bezalel made boards of acacia wood for the upright framework of the tabernacle. 
EXO.36.21	Each board was ten cubits long and one and a half cubits wide. 
EXO.36.22	Each board had two tenons (dovetails), fitted to one another; he did this for all the boards of the tabernacle. 
EXO.36.23	And [this is how] he made the boards [for frames] for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side; 
EXO.36.24	and he made under the twenty boards forty silver sockets; two sockets under one board for its two tenons (dovetails), and two sockets under another board for its two tenons. 
EXO.36.25	For the other side of the tabernacle, the north side, he made twenty boards, 
EXO.36.26	and their forty silver sockets; two sockets under [the end of] each board. 
EXO.36.27	And for the rear of the tabernacle, to the west, he made six [frame] boards. 
EXO.36.28	And he made two boards for each corner of the tabernacle in the rear. 
EXO.36.29	They were separate below, but linked together at the top with one ring; thus he made both of them in both corners. 
EXO.36.30	There were eight boards with sixteen silver sockets, and under [the end of] each board two sockets.
EXO.36.31	Bezalel made bars of acacia wood, five for the [frame] boards of the one side of the tabernacle, 
EXO.36.32	and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle’s other side, and five bars for the boards at the rear side to the west. 
EXO.36.33	And he made the middle bar pass through [horizontally] halfway up the boards from one end to the other. 
EXO.36.34	He overlaid the boards and the bars with gold and made their rings of gold as holders for the bars.
EXO.36.35	Further, Bezalel made the veil of blue and purple and scarlet fabric, and fine twisted linen; he made it with cherubim, the work of an embroiderer. 
EXO.36.36	For the veil (partition curtain) he made four support poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold; their hooks were gold, and he cast for them four silver sockets. 
EXO.36.37	He made a screen (curtain) for the doorway of the tent, of blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, and fine twisted linen, the work of an embroiderer; 
EXO.36.38	and [he made] the five support poles with their hooks, and overlaid their [ornamental] tops and connecting rings with gold; but their five sockets were bronze.
EXO.37.1	Bezalel made the ark [of the covenant] of acacia wood—it was two and a half cubits long, and one and a half cubits wide, and one and a half cubits high. 
EXO.37.2	And he overlaid it with pure gold inside and out, and made a molding (border) of gold to go all around [the top of it]. 
EXO.37.3	He cast four rings of gold for it on its four feet, two rings on one side and two rings on the other side. 
EXO.37.4	He made carrying poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 
EXO.37.5	He put the carrying poles through the rings at the sides of the ark, to carry it. 
EXO.37.6	Bezalel made the mercy seat of pure gold; it was two and a half cubits long, and one and a half cubits wide. 
EXO.37.7	He made two cherubim of hammered gold; he made them at the two ends of the mercy seat, 
EXO.37.8	one cherub at one end and one cherub at the other end; he made the cherubim [of one piece] with the mercy seat at the two ends. 
EXO.37.9	The cherubim spread out their wings upward, covering 
EXO.37.10	Bezalel made the table [for the bread] of acacia wood; it was two cubits long, a cubit wide, and one and a half cubits high. 
EXO.37.11	He overlaid it with pure gold, and made a border of gold for it all around [its top]. 
EXO.37.12	He made a rim for it [just under the top] a hand width wide all around, and a border of gold around its rim. 
EXO.37.13	He cast four rings of gold for it and fastened the rings to the four corners that were at its four legs. 
EXO.37.14	Close by the rim were the rings, the holders for the poles [to pass through] to carry the table. 
EXO.37.15	Bezalel made the carrying poles of acacia wood to carry the table and overlaid them with gold. 
EXO.37.16	He made the utensils which were to be on the table, its dishes and its pans [for bread], its bowls and its jars for pouring drink offerings, of pure gold.
EXO.37.17	Then he made the lampstand (menorah) of pure gold. He made the lampstand of hammered work, its base and its [center] shaft; its cups, its 
EXO.37.18	There were six branches coming out of the sides of the lampstand, three branches from one side of 
EXO.37.19	three cups shaped like almond 
EXO.37.20	On 
EXO.37.21	and a calyx was under the 
EXO.37.22	Their calyxes and their branches were 
EXO.37.23	He made its seven lamps with its snuffers and its trays of pure gold. 
EXO.37.24	He made the lampstand and all its utensils from a talent of pure gold.
EXO.37.25	Then Bezalel made the incense altar of acacia wood; its top was a cubit square and it was two cubits high; the horns were 
EXO.37.26	He overlaid it with pure gold, its top, its sides all around and its horns; he also made a rim of gold around it. 
EXO.37.27	He made two rings of gold for it under its rim, on its two opposite sides, as holders for the poles [to pass through] to carry it. 
EXO.37.28	He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 
EXO.37.29	He also made the holy anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense of spices, the work of a perfumer.
EXO.38.1	Then Bezalel made the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood; its top was square, five cubits long and five cubits wide, and three cubits high. 
EXO.38.2	And he made its horns (horn-shaped projections) on the four corners of it; the horns were 
EXO.38.3	He made all the utensils 
EXO.38.4	He made for the altar a grating of bronze mesh under its rim, extending halfway up it. 
EXO.38.5	He cast four rings for the four corners of the bronze grating as holders for the carrying poles. 
EXO.38.6	And he made the carrying poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze. 
EXO.38.7	He put the poles through the rings on the sides of the altar, with which to carry it; he made it hollow with planks.
EXO.38.8	Bezalel made the basin and its base of bronze from the mirrors of the attending women who served 
EXO.38.9	Then he made the court: for the south side the curtains of the court were of fine twisted linen, a hundred cubits; 
EXO.38.10	their twenty support poles, and their twenty bronze sockets; the hooks of the support poles and their connecting rings were silver. 
EXO.38.11	And for the north side [of the court the curtains were also] a hundred cubits; their twenty support poles and their twenty bronze sockets; the hooks of the support poles and their connecting rings were silver. 
EXO.38.12	For the west side [of the court] there were curtains of fifty cubits with their ten support poles and their ten sockets; the hooks of the support poles and their connecting rings were silver. 
EXO.38.13	For the east side [the front of the courtyard, there were curtains of] fifty cubits. 
EXO.38.14	The curtains for one side 
EXO.38.15	and 
EXO.38.16	All the curtains around the court were of fine twisted linen. 
EXO.38.17	The sockets for the support poles were 
EXO.38.18	The screen (curtain) for the gate of the courtyard [on the east side] was the work of an embroiderer, in blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, and fine twisted linen; it was twenty cubits long and five cubits high, corresponding to the curtains of the court. 
EXO.38.19	Their four support poles and their four sockets were bronze; their hooks were silver, and silver overlaid their tops and their connecting rings. 
EXO.38.20	All the pegs for the tabernacle and the court were bronze.
EXO.38.21	This is the sum of the things for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the Testimony, as counted according to the command of Moses, for the work of the Levites, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 
EXO.38.22	Now Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made everything that the L
EXO.38.23	With him was Oholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver and a skillful craftsman and an embroiderer in blue and in purple and in scarlet fabric, and in fine linen.
EXO.38.24	All the gold that was used for the work, in all the building 
EXO.38.25	The silver from those of the congregation who were assembled 
EXO.38.26	a beka for each man (that is, half a shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary) for everyone who was counted, from twenty years old and upward, for 603,550 men. 
EXO.38.27	The hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary and the sockets of the veil (partition curtain); a hundred sockets for the hundred talents, a talent for a socket. 
EXO.38.28	Of the 1,775 
EXO.38.29	The bronze of the wave offering was seventy talents and 2,400 shekels. 
EXO.38.30	With it Bezalel made the sockets for the doorway of the Tent of Meeting, and the bronze altar and its bronze grating, and all the utensils of the altar, 
EXO.38.31	and the sockets of the court all around and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pegs of the tabernacle and all the pegs around the court.
EXO.39.1	Moreover, from the blue and purple and scarlet fabric, they made finely woven garments for serving 
EXO.39.2	Bezalel made the ephod of gold, and of blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, and fine twisted linen. 
EXO.39.3	Then Bezalel and Oholiab hammered the gold [into thin sheets] and cut it into threads to work into the blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, and into the fine linen, the work of a skilled craftsman. 
EXO.39.4	They made attaching shoulder pieces for the ephod; it was attached at its two [upper] edges. 
EXO.39.5	The skillfully woven sash with which to bind it, which was on the ephod [to hold it in place], was like its workmanship, of the same material: of gold and of blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, and fine twisted linen, just as the L
EXO.39.6	They made the onyx stones, set in settings of gold filigree; they were engraved as signets are engraved, with the names of [the twelve tribes of] the sons of Israel. 
EXO.39.7	And he put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod to be memorial stones (a remembrance) for the sons of Israel (Jacob), just as the L
EXO.39.8	Bezalel made the breastpiece, the work of a skillful craftsman, like the workmanship of the ephod: of gold and of blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, and fine twisted linen. 
EXO.39.9	It was square; they made the breastpiece folded double, a [hand’s] span long and a [hand’s] span wide when folded double. 
EXO.39.10	And they mounted four rows of stones on it. The first row was a row of ruby, topaz, and emerald; 
EXO.39.11	and the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire, and a diamond; 
EXO.39.12	and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; 
EXO.39.13	and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper; they were mounted in settings of gold filigree. 
EXO.39.14	The stones corresponded to the names of the sons of Israel; they were twelve [in all], corresponding to their names, engraved like a signet, each with its name, for the twelve tribes. 
EXO.39.15	And they made on the breastpiece twisted chains like cords of pure gold. 
EXO.39.16	They made two settings of gold filigree and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastpiece. 
EXO.39.17	Then they put the two twisted cords of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastpiece. 
EXO.39.18	They put the [other] two ends of the two cords on the two filigree settings, and put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front of it. 
EXO.39.19	They made two rings of gold and put them on the two ends of the breastpiece, on its inner edge which was next to the ephod. 
EXO.39.20	Furthermore, they made two [other] gold rings and attached them to the bottom of the two shoulder pieces of the ephod, at the front of it, close to the place where it is joined, above the woven sash of the ephod. 
EXO.39.21	They bound the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord, so that it would lie on the woven sash of the ephod, and so that the breastpiece would not come loose from the ephod, just as the L
EXO.39.22	Then Bezalel made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue; 
EXO.39.23	there was an opening [for the head] in the middle of the robe, like the opening in a coat of armor, with a hem around it, so that it would not be frayed 
EXO.39.24	On the hem of the robe they made pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, and fine twisted linen. 
EXO.39.25	They also made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates around the hem of the robe; 
EXO.39.26	a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, all [the way] around the hem of the robe, for service 
EXO.39.27	And they made tunics of finely woven linen for Aaron and his sons, 
EXO.39.28	and the turban of fine linen, and the ornamental caps of fine linen, and the linen undergarments of fine twisted linen, 
EXO.39.29	and the sash of fine twisted linen, and blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, the work of an embroiderer, just as the L
EXO.39.30	They made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote on it an inscription, like the engravings of a signet, “Holy to the L
EXO.39.31	They tied a blue cord to it, to fasten it on the turban above, just as the L
EXO.39.32	Thus all the work of the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting was finished; and the Israelites did according to all that the L
EXO.39.33	They brought the tabernacle to Moses [for him to inspect]: the tent and all its furnishings, its hooks, its [frame] boards, its bars, its support poles, its sockets 
EXO.39.34	and the covering of rams’ skins dyed red, and the covering of 
EXO.39.35	the ark of the Testimony, its carrying poles and the mercy seat; 
EXO.39.36	the table and all its utensils and the bread of the Presence (showbread); 
EXO.39.37	the pure 
EXO.39.38	the golden altar [of incense], the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and the [hanging] veil for the doorway of the tent; 
EXO.39.39	the bronze altar [of burnt offering] and its grating of bronze, its poles and all its utensils, the basin and its base; 
EXO.39.40	the curtains of the courtyard, its support poles and sockets, and the screen (curtain) for the courtyard gate, its cords and pegs, and all the utensils for the service of the tabernacle, for the Tent of Meeting [of God with His people];

LEV.8.24	He also brought Aaron’s sons forward and put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears, and the thumbs of their right hands, and the big toes of their right feet; and Moses sprinkled the

LEV.8.30	So Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron and his garments, and also on his sons and their garments with him; so Moses consecrated Aaron and his garments, and his sons and his sons’ garments with him.
LEV.8.31	Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, “Boil the meat at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting and eat it there together with the bread that is in the basket of the consecration (ordination) offering, just as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it.’ 
LEV.8.32	And what remains of the meat and of the bread you shall burn in the fire. 
LEV.8.33	You shall not go outside the doorway of the Tent of Meeting for seven days, until the days of your consecration (ordination) are ended; for it will take seven days to consecrate you. 
LEV.8.34	As has been done this day, so the L
LEV.8.35	You shall remain day and night for seven days at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting, doing what the Lord has required you to do, so that you will not die; for so I (Moses) have been commanded.”

LEV.9.12	Then he killed the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons handed the blood to him and he sprinkled it around on the altar. 
LEV.9.13	They brought the burnt offering to him piece by piece, with the head, and Aaron offered them up in smoke on the altar. 
LEV.9.14	He also washed the entrails and the legs, and offered them up in smoke with the burnt offering on the altar.
LEV.9.15	Then Aaron presented the people’s offering. He took the goat for the sin offering of the people, and killed it and offered it for sin, as 
LEV.9.16	He also presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the ordinance. 
LEV.9.17	Next Aaron presented the grain offering and took a handful of it and offered it up in smoke on the altar in addition to the burnt offering of the morning.
LEV.9.18	He also killed the bull and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings which was for the people; and Aaron’s sons handed the blood to him and he sprinkled it around on the altar, 
LEV.9.19	As for the portions of fat from the bull and from the ram—the fat tail, and the fat covering the internal organs, and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver— 
LEV.9.20	they now put the portions of fat on the breasts; and Aaron offered the fat up in smoke on the altar. 
LEV.9.21	But the breasts and the right thigh Aaron presented as a wave offering before the L
LEV.9.22	Then Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them, and came down [from the altar of burnt offering] after presenting the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings.

LEV.10.3	So Aaron, therefore, said nothing.

LEV.10.15	They shall bring the thigh presented by lifting up and the breast presented by waving, along with the offerings by fire of the fat, to present as a wave offering before the L

LEV.10.17	“Why did you not eat the sin offering in the holy place? For it is most holy; and God gave it to you to remove the guilt of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the L

NUM.13.6	from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh; 
NUM.13.7	from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph; 
NUM.13.8	from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea [that is, Joshua] the son of Nun; 
NUM.13.9	from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu; 
NUM.13.10	from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi; 
NUM.13.11	from the tribe of Joseph, that is, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi; 
NUM.13.12	from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli; 
NUM.13.13	from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael; 
NUM.13.14	from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi; 
NUM.13.15	from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. 
NUM.13.16	These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land; but Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua (the L
NUM.13.17	Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, “Go up this way into the Negev (the South country); then go up into the hill country. 
NUM.13.18	See what the land is like and whether the people who live there are strong or weak, few or many, 
NUM.13.19	and whether the land in which they live is good or bad, and whether the cities in which they live are [open] camps or fortifications, 
NUM.13.20	and what the land is, whether it is fat (productive) or lean, whether there is timber on it or not. Make an effort to get some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes.
NUM.13.21	So they went up and spied out the land from the Wilderness of Zin to Rehob [a town in Lebanon], at Lebo-hamath [in the far north]. 
NUM.13.22	When they had gone up into the Negev (the South country), they came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai the descendants of Anak were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
NUM.13.23	Then they came to the Valley of Eshcol (cluster of grapes), and from there cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes; and they carried it on a pole between two of them, with some of pomegranates and the figs. 
NUM.13.24	That place was called the Valley of Eshcol (cluster of grapes) because of the cluster of grapes which the sons of Israel cut down there.
NUM.13.25	When they returned from spying out the land, at the end of forty days, 
NUM.13.26	they came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the sons of Israel in the Wilderness of Paran at Kadesh, and brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the land’s fruit. 
NUM.13.27	They reported to Moses and said, “We went in to the land where you sent us; and it certainly does

NUM.13.29	[The people descended from] Amalek live in the land of the Negev (South country); the Hittite, the Jebusite, and the Amorite live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live by the [Dead] Sea and along the side of the Jordan.”
NUM.13.30	Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, “Let us go up at once and take possession of it; for we will certainly conquer it.” 
NUM.13.31	But the men who had gone up with him said, “We are not able to go up against the people [of Canaan], for they are too strong for us.” 
NUM.13.32	So they gave the Israelites a bad report about the land which they had spied out, saying, “The land through which we went, in spying it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants. And all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature. 
NUM.13.33	There we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak are part of the Nephilim); and we were like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their sight.”
NUM.14.1	Then all the congregation [of Israel] raised their voices and cried out, and the people wept that night. 
NUM.14.2	All the Israelites murmured [in discontent] against Moses and Aaron; and the whole congregation said to them, “Oh that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or that we had died in this wilderness! 
NUM.14.3	Why is the L
NUM.14.4	So they said one to another, “Let us appoint a [new] leader and return to Egypt.”
NUM.14.5	Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the Israelites. 
NUM.14.6	Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes [as a sign of grief], 
NUM.14.7	and they spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, “The land through which we passed as spies is an exceedingly good land.

NUM.14.24	But My servant Caleb, because he has a different spirit and has followed Me fully, I will bring into the land into which he entered, and his descendants shall take possession of it.

NUM.14.27	“How long 
NUM.14.28	Say to them, ‘As I live,’ says the L
NUM.14.29	your dead bodies will fall in this wilderness, even all who were numbered of you, your entire number from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against Me. 
NUM.14.30	Except for Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun, not one of you shall enter the land in which I swore [an oath] to settle you. 
NUM.14.31	But your children whom you said would become plunder, I will bring in, and they will know the land which you have despised 
NUM.14.32	But as for you, your dead bodies will fall in this wilderness.

NUM.14.38	But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive out of those men who went to spy out the land.
NUM.14.39	Moses spoke the Lord’s words to all the Israelites, and the people mourned greatly.

NUM.16.14	Indeed, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? We will not come up!”

NUM.16.48	He stood between the dead and the living, so that the plague was brought to an end. 
NUM.16.49	But those who died in the plague were 14,700, besides those who died because of Korah.

NUM.20.5	Why have you made us come up from Egypt, to bring us to this wretched place? It is not a place of grain or of figs or of vines or of pomegranates, and there is no water to drink.” 
NUM.20.6	Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the doorway of the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle) and fell on their faces [before the L

NUM.20.10	and Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly before the rock. Moses said to them, “Listen now, you rebels; must we bring you water out of this rock?” 
NUM.20.11	Then Moses raised his hand [in anger] and with his rod he struck the rock twice [instead of speaking to the rock as the L

NUM.20.14	Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of 
NUM.20.15	that our fathers (ancestors) went down to Egypt, and we lived there for a long time, and the Egyptians treated [both] us and our fathers badly. 
NUM.20.16	But when we cried out to the L
NUM.20.17	Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through a field or through a vineyard; we will not even drink water from a well. We will go along the 
NUM.20.18	But [the king of] Edom said to him, “You shall not pass through my territory, or I will come out against you with the sword.” 
NUM.20.19	Again, the Israelites said to him, “We will go by the highway [trade route], and if I and my livestock drink any of your water, then I will pay for it. Only let me pass through on foot, nothing else.” 
NUM.20.20	But the king of Edom said, “You shall not pass through [my territory].” And Edom came out against Israel with many people and a strong hand. 
NUM.20.21	Thus [the king of] Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory, so Israel turned away from him.
NUM.20.22	Now when they set out from Kadesh, the Israelites, the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor.
NUM.20.23	Then the L
NUM.20.24	“Aaron will be gathered to his people [in death]; for he shall not enter the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you [both] rebelled against My command at the waters of Meribah.

NUM.20.26	and strip Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son. So Aaron will be gathered 
NUM.20.27	So Moses did just as the L
NUM.20.28	After Moses stripped Aaron of his [priestly] garments and put them on Eleazar his son, Aaron died there on the mountain top. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. 
NUM.20.29	When all the congregation saw that Aaron had died, all the house of Israel wept (mourned) for him thirty days.
NUM.21.1	When the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the Negev (the South country) heard that Israel was coming by the way of Atharim [the route traveled by the spies sent out by Moses], he fought against Israel and took some of them captive. 
NUM.21.2	So Israel made a vow to the L

NUM.21.4	Then they set out from Mount Hor by the way of the [branch of the] Red Sea [called the Gulf of Aqabah], to go around the land of Edom; and the people became impatient, because [of the challenges] of the journey. 
NUM.21.5	So the people spoke against God and against Moses, “Why have you brought us out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, nor is there any water, and we loathe this miserable food.”
NUM.21.6	Then the L
NUM.21.7	So the people came to Moses, and said, “We have sinned, for we have spoken against the L
NUM.21.8	Then the L
NUM.21.9	So Moses made a serpent of bronze and put it on the pole, and it happened that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked to the bronze serpent, he lived.
NUM.21.10	Now the sons of Israel moved out and camped at Oboth. 
NUM.21.11	They journeyed on from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim, in the wilderness facing Moab, toward the sunrise. 
NUM.21.12	From there they set out and camped in the 
NUM.21.13	From there they journeyed on and camped on the other side of [the river] Arnon, which is in the wilderness that extends from the boundary of the Amorites; for [the river] Arnon is the boundary of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. 
NUM.21.14	That is why it is said in the 
NUM.21.14	“
NUM.21.14	And the 
NUM.21.15	And the slope of the wadis
NUM.21.15	That stretches toward the site of Ar
NUM.21.15	And leans to the border of Moab.”
NUM.21.16	From there 
NUM.21.17	Then Israel sang this song,
NUM.21.17	“Spring up, O well! Sing to it,
NUM.21.18	The well which the leaders dug,
NUM.21.18	Which the nobles of the people hollowed out
NUM.21.18	With the scepter and with their staffs.”
NUM.21.18	And from the wilderness 
NUM.21.19	and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth, 
NUM.21.20	and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah which looks down on the wasteland.
NUM.21.21	Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, saying, 
NUM.21.22	“Let me pass through your land; we will not turn away [from the road] into field or vineyard; we will not drink the water of the wells. We will go by the king’s highway until we have crossed your border.” 
NUM.21.23	But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border. Instead Sihon gathered all his people together and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz, and he fought against Israel. 
NUM.21.24	Then Israel struck the king of the Amorites with the edge of the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the Ammonites, for the boundary of the Ammonites was 
NUM.21.25	Israel took all these cities, and settled in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon and in all its towns. 
NUM.21.26	For Heshbon was the city of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken all his land out of his hand, as far as the Arnon. 
NUM.21.27	That is why those who use proverbs say,
NUM.21.27	“Come to Heshbon,
NUM.21.27	Let the city of Sihon be built and established.
NUM.21.28	For fire has gone out of Heshbon,
NUM.21.28	A flame from the city of Sihon;
NUM.21.28	It devoured Ar of Moab
NUM.21.28	And the lords of the heights of the Arnon.
NUM.21.29	Woe (judgment is coming) to you, Moab!
NUM.21.29	You are destroyed, O people of [the god] Chemosh!
NUM.21.29	Moab has given his sons as fugitives [that is, survivors of battle],
NUM.21.29	And his daughters into captivity
NUM.21.29	To Sihon king of the Amorites.
NUM.21.30	We have shot them down [with arrows];
NUM.21.30	Heshbon is destroyed as far as Dibon,
NUM.21.30	And we have laid them waste as far as Nophah,
NUM.21.30	Which reaches to Medeba.”
NUM.21.31	Thus Israel settled in the land of the Amorites. 
NUM.21.32	Now Moses sent

NUM.21.34	But the L
NUM.21.35	So the sons of Israel killed Og and his sons and all his people, until there was no survivor left to him; and they took possession of his land.
NUM.22.1	The Israelites journeyed, and camped in the plains of Moab, on the east side of the Jordan [River] across from Jericho.
NUM.22.2	And Balak [the king of Moab] the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. 
NUM.22.3	So Moab was terrified because of the people, for they were numerous. Moab was overcome with fear because of the sons of Israel. 
NUM.22.4	Moab said to the elders of Midian, “Now this horde will lick up all that is around us, just as the ox licks up the grass of the field.” And Balak the son of Zippor was the king of Moab at that time. 
NUM.22.5	So he sent messengers to 
NUM.22.6	Now please come, curse these people for me, for they are too powerful for me; perhaps I will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. For I know [your reputation] that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.”
NUM.22.7	So the elders of Moab and of Midian departed with 
NUM.22.8	Balaam said to them, “Spend the night here and I will bring word back to you as the L
NUM.22.9	God came to Balaam, and said, “Who are these men with you?” 
NUM.22.10	Balaam said to God, “Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent 
NUM.22.11	‘Hear this, the people who came out of Egypt cover the surface of the land; come now, curse them for me. Perhaps I may be able to fight against them and drive them out.’ ” 
NUM.22.12	God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them; you shall not curse the people [of Israel], for they are blessed.” 
NUM.22.13	Balaam got up in the morning, and said to the leaders of Balak, “Go back to your own land [of Moab], for the L
NUM.22.14	The leaders of Moab arose and went to Balak, and said, “Balaam refused to come with us.”
NUM.22.15	Then Balak again sent leaders, more numerous and [men who were] more distinguished than the first ones. 
NUM.22.16	They came to Balaam, and said to him, “Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, ‘I beg you, let nothing hinder you from coming to me. 
NUM.22.17	For I will give you a very great honor and I will do whatever you tell me; so please come, curse these people [of Israel] for me.’ ” 
NUM.22.18	Balaam answered the servants of Balak, “Even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything, either small or great, contrary to the command of the L
NUM.22.19	Now please, you also stay here tonight, and I will find out what else the L
NUM.22.20	God came to Balaam at night and said to him, “If the men have come to call you, get up and go with them, but you shall

NUM.22.22	But God’s anger was kindled because

NUM.22.30	The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden all your life until this day? Have I ever been accustomed to do so to you?” And he said, “No.”
NUM.22.31	Then the L
NUM.22.32	The Angel of the L
NUM.22.33	The donkey saw Me and turned away from Me these three times. If she had not turned away from Me, I would have certainly killed you now, and let her live.” 
NUM.22.34	Balaam said to the Angel of the L

NUM.22.36	When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, which is on the border at the Arnon [River], at the farthest end of the border. 
NUM.22.37	Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not urgently send 
NUM.22.38	So Balaam said to Balak, “Indeed I have come to you now, but am I able to say anything at all? The word that God puts in my mouth, that I shall speak.” 
NUM.22.39	And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth. 
NUM.22.40	Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent 
NUM.22.41	Then it came about in the morning that Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the high places of Baal; from there he saw a portion of the Israelites.
NUM.23.1	Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars for me here, and prepare for me seven bulls and seven rams here.” 
NUM.23.2	Balak did just as Balaam had said, and Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
NUM.23.3	Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stand beside your burnt offering and I will go. Perhaps the L
NUM.23.4	Now God met Balaam, who said to Him, “I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered a bull and a ram on each altar.” 
NUM.23.5	Then the L
NUM.23.6	Balaam returned to Balak, and behold, he was standing by his burnt sacrifice, he and all the leaders of Moab. 
NUM.23.7	Balaam took up his [first] discourse (oracle) and said:
NUM.23.7	“Balak, the king of Moab, has brought me from Aram (Syria),
NUM.23.7	from the mountains of the east, [saying,]
NUM.23.7	‘Come, curse [the descendants of] Jacob for me;

NUM.23.8	How shall I curse those whom God has not cursed?
NUM.23.8	Or how can I [violently] denounce those the L
NUM.23.9	For from the top of the rocks I see Israel,
NUM.23.9	And from the hills I look at him.

NUM.23.10	And let my end be like his!”
NUM.23.11	Then Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but here you have [thoroughly] blessed them instead!” 
NUM.23.12	Balaam answered, “Must I not be obedient 
NUM.23.13	Balak said to him, “Come with me, I implore you, to another place from where you can see them, although you will see only the nearest and not all of them; and curse them for me from there.” 
NUM.23.14	So he took Balaam to the field of Zophim to the top of [Mount] Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
NUM.23.15	Balaam said to Balak, “Stand here beside your burnt offering while I go to meet the L

NUM.23.18	“Rise up, O Balak, and hear;

NUM.23.19	God is not a man, that He should lie,

NUM.23.19	Or has He spoken and will He not make it good 
NUM.23.20	Behold, I have received

NUM.23.22	God brought them out of Egypt;

NUM.23.23	For there is no enchantment 
NUM.23.23	Nor is there any divination against Israel.
NUM.23.23	At the proper time it shall be said to Jacob
NUM.23.23	And to Israel, what has God done!
NUM.23.24	Behold, a people rises up like a lioness
NUM.23.24	And lifts itself up like a lion;
NUM.23.24	He will not lie down until he devours the prey
NUM.23.24	And drinks the blood of the slain.”
NUM.23.25	Then Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all!” 
NUM.23.26	But Balaam answered Balak, “Did I not say to you, ‘All that the L
NUM.23.27	Then Balak said to Balaam, “Please come; I will take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them for me from there.” 
NUM.23.28	So Balak brought Balaam to the top of [Mount] Peor, that overlooks the wasteland. 
NUM.23.29	And Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars for me here, and prepare for me seven bulls and seven rams here.” 
NUM.23.30	Balak did just as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
NUM.24.1	When Balaam saw that it pleased the L
NUM.24.2	And Balaam raised his eyes and he saw Israel living 
NUM.24.3	He took up his [third] discourse (oracle) and said:
NUM.24.3	“The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor,
NUM.24.3	And the oracle of the man whose eye is opened [at last, to see clearly the purpose and will of God],
NUM.24.4	The oracle of one who hears the words of God,
NUM.24.4	Who sees the vision of the Almighty,
NUM.24.4	Falling down, but having his eyes open 
NUM.24.5	How fair are your tents, O Jacob,
NUM.24.5	And your tabernacles, O Israel!
NUM.24.6	Like valleys that stretch out,
NUM.24.6	Like gardens beside the river,

NUM.24.6	Like cedars beside the waters.

NUM.24.8	And will crush their bones in pieces,
NUM.24.8	And shatter them with his arrows.

NUM.24.9	And as a lioness, who dares to rouse him?
NUM.24.9	Blessed [of God] is he who blesses you,
NUM.24.9	And cursed [of God] is he who curses you.”
NUM.24.10	Then Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, “I called you to curse my enemies, but behold, you have done nothing but bless them these three times. 
NUM.24.11	Therefore now flee to your place! I had intended to honor you greatly, but behold, the L
NUM.24.12	Balaam said to Balak, “Did I not tell your messengers whom you had sent to me,

NUM.24.14	And now, look, I am going to my people; come, I will advise you as to what this people [Israel] will do to your people [Moab] in the days to come.”
NUM.24.15	He took up his [fourth] discourse (oracle) and said:
NUM.24.15	“The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor,

NUM.24.19	And will destroy the remnant from the city.”
NUM.24.20	Balaam looked at Amalek and took up his [fifth] discourse (oracle) and said:
NUM.24.20	“Amalek was the first of the [neighboring] nations [to oppose the Israelites after they left Egypt],
NUM.24.20	But his end shall be

NUM.24.21	“Strong is your dwelling place,
NUM.24.21	And you set your nest in the cliff.
NUM.24.22	Nevertheless the Kenites will be consumed.
NUM.24.22	How long will Asshur (Assyria) keep you (Israel) captive?”
NUM.24.23	Then he took up his [seventh] discourse (oracle) and said:
NUM.24.23	“Alas, who can live unless God has ordained it?
NUM.24.24	But ships 
NUM.24.24	And shall afflict Asshur (Assyria) and

NUM.24.25	Then Balaam arose and departed and returned to his place, and Balak also went on his way.
NUM.25.1	Israel settled 
NUM.25.2	For they invited the Israelites to the sacrifices of their gods, and the Israelites ate [food offered to idols] and bowed down to Moab’s gods. 
NUM.25.3	So Israel joined themselves to Baal of Peor [in worship]. And the anger of the L

NUM.25.6	Then one of the Israelites came and presented to his relatives a Midianite woman, in the sight of Moses and the whole congregation of the Israelites, while they were weeping [over God’s judgment] at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle). 
NUM.25.7	When Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw this, he left the congregation and took a spear in his hand, 
NUM.25.8	and he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and pierced both of them through the body, the man of Israel and the woman. Then the plague on the Israelites stopped. 
NUM.25.9	Nevertheless, those [Israelites] who died in the plague numbered 24,000.

NUM.25.14	Now the name of the man of Israel who was killed with the Midianite woman was Zimri the son of Salu, a leader of a father’s household among the Simeonites. 
NUM.25.15	The name of the Midianite woman who was killed was Cozbi the daughter of Zur, who was the tribal head of a father’s household in Midian.

NUM.26.2	“Take a census of all the [males in the] congregation of the sons of Israel from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers’ households, all in Israel who are able to go to war.”

DEU.3.14	Jair the son (descendant) of Manasseh took all the region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, 
DEU.3.15	I gave Gilead to Machir [of Manasseh]. 
DEU.3.16	To the Reubenites and Gadites I gave 
DEU.3.17	the Arabah also, with the Jordan as its boundary, from Chinnereth (the Sea of Galilee) as far as the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea (Dead Sea), at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah on the east.

DEU.3.26	But the L

DEU.3.28	But command Joshua and encourage and strengthen him, for he shall go across and lead this people, and he will give them the land which you see as an inheritance.’ 
DEU.3.29	So we stayed in the Valley opposite Beth-peor.
DEU.4.1	“Now, O Israel, listen

DEU.4.43	Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau for the Reubenites, and Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites.
DEU.4.44	This is the law which Moses placed before the sons of Israel; 
DEU.4.45	these are the testimonies (legal provisions) and the statutes and the judgments which Moses spoke to the sons of Israel when they came out of Egypt, 
DEU.4.46	beyond the Jordan in the Valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the sons of Israel defeated when they came out from Egypt. 
DEU.4.47	They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who

DEU.32.9	Jacob (Israel) is the allotment of His inheritance.
DEU.32.10	He found him in a desert land,
DEU.32.10	In the howling wasteland of a wilderness;
DEU.32.10	He kept circling him, He took care of him,
DEU.32.10	He protected him as the 
DEU.32.11	As an eagle that protects its nest,
DEU.32.11	That flutters over its young,
DEU.32.11	He spread out His wings and took them,
DEU.32.11	He carried them on His pinions.
DEU.32.12	So the L
DEU.32.12	There was no foreign god with him.
DEU.32.13	He made him (Israel) ride on the high places of the earth,
DEU.32.13	And he ate the produce of the field;
DEU.32.13	And He made him suck honey from the rock,
DEU.32.13	And [olive] oil from the flinty rock,
DEU.32.14	Butter 
DEU.32.14	With fat of lambs,
DEU.32.14	And rams, the breed of Bashan, and goats,
DEU.32.14	With the finest of the wheat;
DEU.32.14	And you drank wine, the blood of grapes.
DEU.32.15	“But Jeshurun (Israel) became fat and kicked [at God].
DEU.32.15	You became fat, thick, sleek, 
DEU.32.15	Then he abandoned God who had made him,
DEU.32.15	And scorned the Rock of his salvation.
DEU.32.16	They provoked Him to jealousy with strange 
DEU.32.16	And with repulsive acts they provoked Him to anger.
DEU.32.17	They sacrificed to demons, not to God,
DEU.32.17	To gods whom they have not known,
DEU.32.17	New 
DEU.32.17	Whom your fathers never feared.

DEU.32.21	So I will make them jealous with those who are not a people;
DEU.32.21	I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
DEU.32.22	For a fire is kindled by My anger,
DEU.32.22	And it burns to the depths of Sheol (the place of the dead, the nether world),
DEU.32.22	It devours the earth with its yield,
DEU.32.22	And sets on fire the foundations of the mountains.

JOS.6.3	Now you shall march around the city, all the men of war circling the city once. You shall do this [once each day] for six days. 
JOS.6.4	Also, seven priests shall carry seven trumpets [made] of rams’ horns ahead of the ark; then on the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets. 
JOS.6.5	When they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall cry out with a great shout (battle cry); and the wall of the city will fall down in its place, and the people shall go up, each man [going] straight ahead [climbing over the rubble].”
JOS.6.6	So Joshua the son of Nun called for the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and have seven priests carry seven trumpets 
JOS.6.7	He said to the people, “Go forward! March around the city, and let the armed men go ahead of the ark of the L
JOS.6.8	And it was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets 
JOS.6.9	The armed men went in front of the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while the priests continued to blow the trumpets. 
JOS.6.10	But Joshua commanded the people, “You shall not shout [the battle cry] nor let your voice be heard nor let a word come out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout!” 
JOS.6.11	So Joshua had the ark of the L
JOS.6.12	Then Joshua got up early in the morning [on the second day], and the priests took up the ark of the L
JOS.6.13	The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets 
JOS.6.14	On the second day they marched around the city once, and returned to the camp; they did this for six days.
JOS.6.15	Then on the seventh day they got up early at daybreak and marched around the city in the same way seven times; only on that day they marched around the city 
JOS.6.16	And the seventh time, when the priests had blown the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, “Shout! For the L
JOS.6.17	The city and everything that is in it shall be under the ban [that is, designated to be destroyed as a form of tribute] to the L
JOS.6.18	But as for you, keep yourselves [away] from the things under the ban [which are to be destroyed], so that you do not covet 
JOS.6.19	All the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron are holy (consecrated) to the L
JOS.6.20	So the people shouted [the battle cry], and the priests blew the trumpets. When the people heard the sound of the trumpet, they raised a great shout and the wall [of Jericho] fell down, so that the sons of Israel went up into the city, every man straight ahead [climbing over the rubble], and they overthrew the city. 
JOS.6.21	Then they utterly destroyed everything that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox and sheep and donkey, with the edge of the sword.
JOS.6.22	But Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the prostitute’s house and bring the woman and all that she has out of there, as you have sworn to her.” 
JOS.6.23	So the young men, the spies, went in and brought out Rahab and her father and her mother and her brothers and everything that she had; they also brought out all her relatives and allowed them to stay outside the camp of Israel [at Gilgal during the time required for ceremonial cleansing]. 
JOS.6.24	Then they completely burned the city and everything that was in it. They put only the silver and the gold, and the articles of bronze and of iron, into the treasury of the house (tabernacle) of the L
JOS.6.25	So Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her father’s household and everything that she had; and she has lived among Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers (scouts) whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
JOS.6.26	Then Joshua made them take an oath at that time, saying, “Cursed before the L
JOS.6.27	So the L
JOS.7.1	But the sons of Israel acted unfaithfully 
JOS.7.2	Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and said to them, “Go up and spy out the land.” So the men went up and spied out Ai. 
JOS.7.3	Then they returned to Joshua and said to him, “Do not make all the people go up [to fight]; have 
JOS.7.4	So about three thousand men from the sons of Israel went up there, but they fled [in retreat] from the men of Ai. 
JOS.7.5	The men of Ai killed about thirty-six of Israel’s men, and chased them from the gate as far as [the bluffs of] Shebarim and struck them down as they descended [the steep pass], so the hearts of the people melted [in despair and began to doubt God’s promise] and became like water (disheartened).
JOS.7.6	Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell face downward on the ground before the ark of the L
JOS.7.7	Joshua said, “Alas, O Lord 
JOS.7.8	O Lord, what can I say now that [the army of] Israel has turned back [in retreat and fled] before their enemies? 
JOS.7.9	For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear about it, and will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. And what will You do for Your great name [to keep it from dishonor]?”
JOS.7.10	So the L
JOS.7.11	Israel has sinned; they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them [to keep]. They have even taken some of the things under the ban, and they have both stolen and 
JOS.7.12	That is why the 
JOS.7.13	Rise up! Consecrate the people and say, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, for thus says the L
JOS.7.14	In the morning you shall come forward by your tribes. And it shall be that the tribe which the L
JOS.7.15	It shall be that the one who is chosen with the things under the ban shall be [killed and his body] burned with fire, he and all that belongs to him, because he has transgressed the covenant of the L
JOS.7.16	So Joshua got up early in the morning and had Israel come forward by tribes, and the tribe of Judah was chosen [by lot]. 
JOS.7.17	He had the families of Judah come forward, and the family of the Zerahites was chosen; and he had the family of the Zerahites come forward man by man, and Zabdi was chosen. 
JOS.7.18	He brought his household forward man by man; and Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was chosen. 
JOS.7.19	Then Joshua said to Achan, “My son, I implore you, give glory to the L
JOS.7.20	So Achan answered Joshua and said, “In truth, I have sinned against the L
JOS.7.21	when I saw among the spoils [in Jericho] a 
JOS.7.22	So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and they saw the stolen objects hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath. 
JOS.7.23	And they took them from the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the sons of Israel, and 
JOS.7.24	Then Joshua and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the [royal] robe, the bar of gold, 
JOS.7.25	Joshua said, “Why have you brought disaster on us? The L
JOS.7.26	Then they piled up over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day. Then the L
JOS.8.1	Now the L
JOS.8.2	You shall do [the same] to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king; [except that] you shall take only its spoil and its cattle as plunder for yourselves. Set up an ambush for the city behind it [on the west side].”
JOS.8.3	So Joshua set out with all the people of war to go up against Ai; then Joshua chose thirty thousand valiant men, and sent them out at night. 
JOS.8.4	He commanded them, saying, “Listen closely, you are going to lie in wait 
JOS.8.5	Then I and all the people who are with me will approach the city. And when they come out to meet us [for battle] as [they did] the first time, we will run away from them. 
JOS.8.6	They will come out after us until we have lured them away from the city, because they will say, ‘They are running from us as [they did] before.’ So we will run from them. 
JOS.8.7	Then you will emerge from the ambush and take possession of the city, for the L
JOS.8.8	When you have taken the city, you shall set it on fire; you shall do [exactly] as the L
JOS.8.9	So Joshua sent them off, and they went to the place for the ambush and stayed [hidden] between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua spent that night among the people [in Gilgal].
JOS.8.10	Now Joshua got up early in the morning and assembled the people, and went up with the elders of Israel before the people to Ai. 
JOS.8.11	Then all the fighting men who were with him went up and advanced and arrived in front of the city, and camped on the north side of Ai. Now there was a ravine between them and Ai. 
JOS.8.12	And Joshua took about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city. 
JOS.8.13	So they stationed the people, all the army—the main encampment that was north of the city, and their rear guard on the west side of the city—and Joshua spent that night in the valley. 
JOS.8.14	Now when the king [and the people] of Ai saw it, the men of the city hurried and got up early and went out to meet Israel in battle, the king and all his people at the appointed [time and] place before the desert plain (the Arabah). But he did not know that there was an ambush against him [waiting] behind the city [on the west side]. 
JOS.8.15	So Joshua and all Israel pretended to be defeated by them, and ran toward the wilderness. 
JOS.8.16	Then all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were lured away from the city. 
JOS.8.17	Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who had not gone out after Israel; so they left the city open 
JOS.8.18	Then the L
JOS.8.19	The [men in] ambush emerged quickly from their [hiding] place, and when Joshua stretched out his hand they ran and entered the city and captured it, and quickly set the city on fire. 
JOS.8.20	When the men of Ai turned back and looked, behold, the smoke of the city was ascending toward the sky, 
JOS.8.21	When Joshua and all Israel saw that the [men in] ambush had taken the city and that the smoke of the city was ascending, they turned back and struck down the men of Ai. 
JOS.8.22	Then the others came out of the city to confront the men of Ai [as they returned], so that they were 
JOS.8.23	But they took the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.
JOS.8.24	When Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field in the wilderness where they pursued them, and they had all fallen by the edge of the sword until they were destroyed, then all Israel returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword. 
JOS.8.25	And all who fell that day, both men and women, were twelve thousand, all the people of Ai. 
JOS.8.26	For Joshua did not withdraw his hand with which he stretched out the spear until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. 
JOS.8.27	Israel took only the livestock and the spoil of that city as plunder for themselves, according to the word of the L
JOS.8.28	So Joshua burned Ai and made it a 
JOS.8.29	He 
JOS.8.30	Then Joshua built an altar to the L
JOS.8.31	just as Moses the servant of the L
JOS.8.32	And there, in the presence of the sons of Israel, Joshua wrote on the stones a copy of the Law of Moses which 
JOS.8.33	All Israel, the stranger as well as the native born [among them], with their elders and officers and their judges, stood on either side of the ark before the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the L
JOS.8.34	Then afterward Joshua read all the words of the law, the blessing and curse, according to all that is written in the Book of the Law. 
JOS.8.35	There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded which Joshua did not read before the entire assembly of Israel, including the women and the children and the foreigners who were living among them.
JOS.9.1	Now when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan, in the hill country and in the lowland [at the western edge of the hills of Judea], and all along the coast of the Great [Mediterranean] Sea toward Lebanon, the Hittite and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, heard of this [army and its victories over Jericho and Ai], 
JOS.9.2	they gathered together with 
JOS.9.3	But when the people of Gibeon [the Hivites] heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, 
JOS.9.4	they too acted craftily 
JOS.9.5	and worn-out and patched sandals on their feet, and worn-out clothes; and all their supply of food was dry and had turned to crumbs. 
JOS.9.6	They went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the men of Israel, “We have come from a far country; so now, make a covenant (treaty) with us.” 
JOS.9.7	But the men of Israel said to the Hivites, “Perhaps you are living within our land; how then can we make a covenant (treaty) with you?” 
JOS.9.8	They said to Joshua, “We are your servants.” Then Joshua said to them, “Who are you, and where do you come from?” 
JOS.9.9	They said to him, “Your servants have come from a country that is very far away because of the fame of the L
JOS.9.10	and everything that He did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon the king of Heshbon and to Og the king of Bashan who 
JOS.9.11	So our elders and all the residents of our country said to us, ‘Take provisions for the journey and go to meet the sons of Israel and say to them, “We are your servants; now make a covenant (treaty) with us.” ’ 
JOS.9.12	This bread of ours was hot (fresh) when we took it along as our provision from our houses on the day we left to come to you; now look, it is dry and has turned to crumbs. 
JOS.9.13	These wineskins which we filled were new, and look, they are split; our clothes and our sandals are worn out because of the very long journey [that we had to make].” 
JOS.9.14	So the men [of Israel] took some of their own provisions [and offered them in friendship], and [foolishly] did not ask for the counsel of the L
JOS.9.15	Joshua made peace with them and made a covenant (treaty) with them, to let them live; and the leaders of the congregation [of Israel] swore 
JOS.9.16	It happened that three days after they had made a covenant (treaty) with them, the Israelites heard that they were [actually] their neighbors and that they were living among them. 
JOS.9.17	Then the sons of Israel set out and came to their cities on the third day. Now the cities [of the Hivites] were Gibeon and Chephirah and Beeroth and Kiriath-jearim. 
JOS.9.18	But the sons of Israel did not strike them because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the L
JOS.9.19	But all the leaders said to the whole congregation, “We have sworn to them by the L
JOS.9.20	This [is what] we will do to them: we will let them live, so that the wrath [of God] does not come upon us for [violating] the oath which we have sworn to them.” 
JOS.9.21	The leaders said to them, “Let them live [as our slaves].” So they became the cutters 
JOS.9.22	Joshua called the [Hivite] men and said, “Why did you deceive us, saying, ‘We 
JOS.9.23	Now therefore, you are cursed, and you shall always be slaves, both cutters 
JOS.9.24	They replied to Joshua and said, “Because your servants were told in no uncertain terms that the L
JOS.9.25	Now look, we are in your hands; do to us as it seems good and right in your sight.” 
JOS.9.26	So that is what he did to them; he rescued them from the hands of the Israelites and they did not kill them. 
JOS.9.27	Now on that day Joshua made them cutters 
JOS.10.1	When Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured Ai, and had utterly destroyed it—as he had done to Jericho and its king, so he had done to Ai and its king—and that the residents of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were [living] among them, 
JOS.10.2	he [and his people] feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty. 
JOS.10.3	So Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent 
JOS.10.4	“Come up to me and help me, and let us attack Gibeon [with a combined army], because it has made peace with Joshua and with the sons (people) of Israel.” 
JOS.10.5	Then the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered together and went up, they with all their armies, and they camped by Gibeon and fought against it.
JOS.10.6	So the men of Gibeon sent 
JOS.10.7	So Joshua 
JOS.10.8	The L
JOS.10.9	So Joshua came upon them suddenly, [surprising them] by marching [uphill] all night from Gilgal. 
JOS.10.10	And the L
JOS.10.11	As they fled before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, the L
JOS.10.12	Then Joshua spoke to the L
JOS.10.12	“Sun, stand still at Gibeon,
JOS.10.12	And moon, in the Valley of Aijalon.”
JOS.10.13	So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped,
JOS.10.13	Until the nation [of Israel] took vengeance upon their enemies.
JOS.10.13	Is it not written in the Book of Jashar? So the sun stood still in the middle of the sky and was in no hurry to go down for about a whole day. 
JOS.10.14	There has not been a day like that before it or after it, when the L
JOS.10.15	Then 
JOS.10.16	Now these five [Amorite] kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah. 
JOS.10.17	And Joshua was told, “The five kings have been found and are hidden in the cave at Makkedah.” 
JOS.10.18	Joshua said, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and assign men by it to guard them, 
JOS.10.19	but do not stay there yourselves; pursue your enemies and attack them from the rear. Do not allow them to enter their cities, for the L
JOS.10.20	Now when Joshua and the sons of Israel had finished striking the Amorites dead in a very great defeat, until they were wiped out, and the surviving remnant among them had entered the fortified cities, 
JOS.10.21	all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace. No one 
JOS.10.22	Then Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave and bring out to me those five [Amorite] kings from the cave.” 
JOS.10.23	They did so, and brought these five [Amorite] kings out of the cave to him—the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon. 
JOS.10.24	When they brought these kings out to Joshua, Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and told the commanders of the men of war who had gone with him, “Come up close, put your feet on the necks of these kings.” So they came forward and put their feet on the necks [of the five kings]. 
JOS.10.25	Joshua said to them, “Do not fear or be dismayed (intimidated)! Be strong and courageous, for this is what the L
JOS.10.26	Then afterward Joshua struck them [with his sword] and put them to death, and he hung them on five trees; and they 
JOS.10.27	At sunset Joshua gave a command, and they took the bodies down from the trees and threw them into the cave where the kings had hidden themselves, and placed large stones over the mouth of the cave, [where they remain] to this very day.
JOS.10.28	Now Joshua captured Makkedah on that day, and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword; he utterly destroyed it and 
JOS.10.29	Then Joshua and all Israel with him went on from Makkedah to Libnah, and fought against Libnah. 
JOS.10.30	The L
JOS.10.31	And Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Libnah to Lachish, and they camped by it and fought against it. 
JOS.10.32	The L
JOS.10.33	Then Horam king of Gezer went up to help Lachish, and Joshua struck him and his people down until he had left him no survivor.
JOS.10.34	And Joshua and all Israel with him went on from Lachish to Eglon, and they camped by it and fought against it. 
JOS.10.35	They captured it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword; and on that day he utterly destroyed every person who was in it, just as he had done to Lachish.
JOS.10.36	Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron, and they fought against it 
JOS.10.37	and captured it and struck it and its king and all its cities and all the persons who were in it with the edge of the sword. He left no survivor, just as he had done to Eglon. He utterly destroyed it and every person who was in it.
JOS.10.38	Then Joshua and all Israel with him returned to Debir, and fought against it. 
JOS.10.39	He captured it with its king and all its cities, and they struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed every person who was in it. He left no survivor. Just as he had done to Hebron, so Joshua did to Debir and its king, as he had done also to Libnah and its king.
JOS.10.40	So Joshua struck all the land, the hill country, the Negev (South country) and the lowland and the slopes [that descend to the Dead Sea] and all their kings. He left no survivor, but he utterly destroyed all who breathed, just as the L
JOS.10.41	Joshua struck them from Kadesh-barnea even as far as Gaza, and all the country of Goshen even as far as Gibeon. 
JOS.10.42	Joshua captured all these kings and their land at one time, because the L
JOS.10.43	So Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at Gilgal.
JOS.11.1	Then when Jabin king of Hazor heard [of Israel’s other victories] he sent 
JOS.11.2	and to the kings who were in the north, in the hill country, and in the Arabah [the plain] south of Chinnereth (the Sea of Galilee) and in the lowland and on the hills of Dor on the west; 
JOS.11.3	to the Canaanite in the east and in the west, and to the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the hill country, and the Hivite at the foot of [Mount] Hermon in the land of Mizpeh. 
JOS.11.4	They went out, they and all their armies with them, as many people as the sand on the seashore, with very many horses and chariots. 
JOS.11.5	So all these kings met and they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.
JOS.11.6	Then the L
JOS.11.7	So Joshua and all the people of war with him came against them suddenly by the waters of Merom, and attacked them. 
JOS.11.8	The L
JOS.11.9	Joshua did to them as the L
JOS.11.10	At that time Joshua turned back and captured Hazor and struck its king dead with the sword; for Hazor previously was the head of all these kingdoms. 
JOS.11.11	They struck all the people who were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them; there was no one left who breathed. And he set fire to Hazor. 
JOS.11.12	Joshua captured all the cities of these kings, and all their kings, and he struck them with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them, just as Moses the servant of the L
JOS.11.13	But Israel did not burn any of the cities that stood [walled and fortified] on their mounds, except Hazor alone, which Joshua burned. 
JOS.11.14	The sons of Israel took as their plunder all the spoil of these cities and the cattle; but they struck every man with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them. They left no one 
JOS.11.15	Just as the L
JOS.11.16	So Joshua took all this land: the hill country, all the Negev (South country), all the land of Goshen, the lowland, the Arabah [plain], the hill country of Israel and its lowland 
JOS.11.17	from Mount Halak, that rises toward Seir [in the south], even as far as Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon at the foot of Mount Hermon [in the north]. He captured all their kings and struck them and put them to death. 
JOS.11.18	Joshua waged war with all these kings 
JOS.11.19	There was no city that made peace with the Israelites except the Hivites living in Gibeon; they took all 
JOS.11.20	For it was [the purpose] of the L
JOS.11.21	Then Joshua came at that time and cut off the 
JOS.11.22	There were no Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel; only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod [of Philistia] some remained. 
JOS.11.23	So Joshua took the whole land [of Canaan], according to all that the L
JOS.12.1	Now these are the kings of the land whom the sons of Israel defeated, and whose land they possessed beyond the Jordan toward the east, from the valley of the [river] Arnon to Mount Hermon, and all the Arabah [plain] to the east: 
JOS.12.2	Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the [river] Arnon, both the middle of the valley and half of Gilead, and as far as the brook Jabbok, [which is] the border of the sons of Ammon; 
JOS.12.3	and the Arabah [plain] as far as the Sea of Chinnereth (Galilee) eastward, and as far as the sea of the Arabah, the Salt (Dead) Sea, eastward toward Beth-jeshimoth, and southward to the foot of the slopes of [Mount] Pisgah; 
JOS.12.4	and the territory of Og king of Bashan, one of the remnant of the Rephaim, who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, 
JOS.12.5	and ruled over Mount Hermon and Salecah and all of Bashan to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and over half of Gilead,

JOS.12.7	These are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the sons of Israel defeated on the west side of the Jordan, from Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir. Joshua gave their land to the tribes of Israel as a possession according to their divisions, 
JOS.12.8	in the hill country, in the lowland (foothills), in the Arabah [plain], on the slopes [descending to the Dead Sea], and in the wilderness, and in the Negev (South country)—the [lands of the] Hittite, the Amorite and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite: 
JOS.12.9	the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one; 
JOS.12.10	the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; 
JOS.12.11	the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one; 
JOS.12.12	the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one; 
JOS.12.13	the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one; 
JOS.12.14	the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one; 
JOS.12.15	the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one; 
JOS.12.16	the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one; 
JOS.12.17	the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one; 
JOS.12.18	the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one; 
JOS.12.19	the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one; 
JOS.12.20	the king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one; 
JOS.12.21	the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one; 
JOS.12.22	the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one; 
JOS.12.23	the king of Dor in the heights of Dor, one; the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one; 
JOS.12.24	the king of Tirzah, one: in all, thirty-one kings.
JOS.13.1	Now Joshua was 
JOS.13.2	This is the land that remains: all the regions of the Philistines and all those of the Geshurites; 
JOS.13.3	from the Shihor [waterway] which is east of Egypt [at the southern end of Canaan], northward to the border of Ekron (all of it regarded as Canaanite); the five rulers of the Philistines: the Gazite, Ashdodite, the Ashkelonite, the Gittite, the Ekronite; and the 
JOS.13.4	in the south, all the land of the Canaanite, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, as far as Aphek, to the border of the Amorite; 
JOS.13.5	and the land of the Gebalite, and all Lebanon, toward 
JOS.13.6	As for all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, even all the Sidonians, I will drive them out before Israel; only allot the land to Israel as an inheritance just as I have commanded you. 
JOS.13.7	So now, divide this land [west of the Jordan] as an inheritance for the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.”
JOS.13.8	With the other half-tribe [of Manasseh], the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance which Moses gave them beyond the Jordan eastward, just as Moses the servant of the L
JOS.13.9	from Aroer on the edge of the valley of the [river] Arnon, and the city in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba, as far as Dibon; 
JOS.13.10	and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, as far as the border of the Ammonites; 
JOS.13.11	and Gilead, and the territory of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan as far as Salecah; 
JOS.13.12	the entire kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei—he alone was left of the remnant of the Rephaim [giants]—for Moses had struck them and dispossessed them. 
JOS.13.13	But the sons of Israel did not dispossess the Geshurites or the Maacathites; for Geshur and Maacath live among Israel to this day. 
JOS.13.14	It was only to the tribe of Levi that Moses gave no [territory as an] inheritance; the offerings by fire to the L
JOS.13.15	So Moses gave 
JOS.13.16	Their territory was from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the [river] Arnon, and the city which is in the middle of the valley and all the plain by Medeba; 
JOS.13.17	with Heshbon, and all its cities which are on the plain: Dibon and Bamoth-baal and Beth-baal-meon, 
JOS.13.18	and Jahaz and Kedemoth and Mephaath, 
JOS.13.19	and Kiriathaim and Sibmah and Zereth-shahar on the hill of the valley, 
JOS.13.20	and Beth-peor and the slopes of Pisgah and Beth-jeshimoth, 
JOS.13.21	even all the cities of the plain and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck down along with the leaders of Midian, Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land. 
JOS.13.22	The sons of Israel also killed Balaam the son of Beor, the diviner (soothsayer), with the sword among [the rest of] their slain. 
JOS.13.23	The border of the sons of Reuben was the Jordan. This was the inheritance of the sons of Reuben according to their families, with their cities and villages.
JOS.13.24	Moses also gave 
JOS.13.25	Their territory was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the sons of Ammon, as far as Aroer east of Rabbah; 
JOS.13.26	and from Heshbon as far as Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim as far as the border of Debir; 
JOS.13.27	and in the valley, Beth-haram and Beth-nimrah and Succoth and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, with the Jordan as a border, as far as the 
JOS.13.28	This is the inheritance of the sons of Gad according to their families, with their cities and their villages.
JOS.13.29	Moses also gave 
JOS.13.30	Their region extended from Mahanaim, all Bashan, the entire kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities; 
JOS.13.31	also half of Gilead, with Ashtaroth and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan; these were for the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh, for half of the sons of Machir according to their families (clans).
JOS.13.32	These are 
JOS.13.33	But to the tribe of Levi, Moses did not give an inheritance; the L
JOS.14.1	Now these are 
JOS.14.2	by the lot of their inheritance, as the L
JOS.14.3	For Moses had given an inheritance to the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan; but he did not give [any territory as] an inheritance to the Levites among them. 
JOS.14.4	For the sons of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim, and no portion was given in the land to the Levites except cities in which to live, with their pasture lands for their livestock and for their property. 
JOS.14.5	The Israelites did just as the L
JOS.14.6	Then the [tribe of the] sons of Judah approached Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know the word which the L
JOS.14.7	I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the L
JOS.14.8	My brothers (fellow spies) who went up with me made the heart of the people melt with fear; but I followed the L
JOS.14.9	So Moses swore [an oath to me] on that day, saying, ‘Be assured that the land on which your foot has walked will be an inheritance to you and to your children always, because you have followed the L
JOS.14.10	And now, look, the L
JOS.14.11	I am still as strong today as I was the day Moses sent me; as my strength was then, so is my strength now, for war and for going out and coming in. 
JOS.14.12	So now, give me this hill country about which the L
JOS.14.13	So Joshua blessed him and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as an inheritance. 
JOS.14.14	Therefore, Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he followed the L
JOS.14.15	The name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba [city of Arba]; 
JOS.15.1	Now the lot (allotment) for the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families reached [southward to] the border of Edom, southward to the wilderness of Zin at its most southern part. 
JOS.15.2	Their southern border was from the lower end of the Salt (Dead) Sea, from the bay that turns southward. 
JOS.15.3	Then it proceeded southward to the ascent of Akrabbim and continued along to Zin, and then went by the south of Kadesh-barnea and continued along to Hezron, and went up to Addar and turned about to Karka. 
JOS.15.4	It continued along to Azmon and proceeded to the 
JOS.15.5	The eastern border was the Salt (Dead) Sea, as far as the mouth of the Jordan. The northern border was from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan. 
JOS.15.6	Then the border went up to Beth-hoglah, and continued along north of Beth-arabah, and the border went up to the [landmark of the] stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. 
JOS.15.7	The border went up to Debir from the Valley of Achor, and turned northward toward Gilgal which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the valley; and the border continued on to the waters of En-shemesh and ended at En-rogel. 
JOS.15.8	Then the border went up by the Valley of Ben-hinnom (son of Hinnom) at the southern slope of the Jebusite [city] (that is, Jerusalem); and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the Valley of Hinnom to the west, which is at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim. 
JOS.15.9	Then the border extended from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah and proceeded to the cities of Mount Ephron; then the border curved to Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim). 
JOS.15.10	The border went around west from Baalah to Mount Seir, and passed along to the northern slope of Mount Jearim (that is, Chesalon), and went down to Beth-shemesh and then continued on through Timnah. 
JOS.15.11	The border proceeded to the slope [of the hill] of Ekron northward, then curved to Shikkeron and continued to Mount Baalah and proceeded to Jabneel. Then the border ended at the [Mediterranean] sea. 
JOS.15.12	The western border was at the Great Sea, with its coastline. This is the border around the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families.
JOS.15.13	Now to Caleb the son of Jephunneh Joshua gave a portion among the sons of Judah, as the L
JOS.15.14	So Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak: Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai, the children of Anak. 
JOS.15.15	Then he went up from there against the people of Debir; Debir was formerly named Kiriath-sepher. 
JOS.15.16	Caleb said, “I will give Achsah my daughter as wife to the man who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it.” 
JOS.15.17	And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s brother, captured it; so he gave him Achsah his daughter as a wife. 
JOS.15.18	Now it came about that when Achsah came 
JOS.15.19	Achsah answered, “Give me a blessing; since you have given me the [dry] land of the Negev (South country), give me springs of water, too.” So he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
JOS.15.20	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families (clans).
JOS.15.21	The cities of the tribe of the sons of Judah in the extreme south toward the border of Edom were Kabzeel and Eder and Jagur, 
JOS.15.22	and Kinah and Dimonah and Adadah, 
JOS.15.23	and Kedesh and Hazor and Ithnan, 
JOS.15.24	Ziph and Telem and Bealoth, 
JOS.15.25	and Hazor-hadattah and Kerioth-hezron (that is, Hazor),

JOS.15.27	and Hazar-gaddah and Heshmon and Beth-pelet, 
JOS.15.28	and Hazar-shual and Beersheba and Biziothiah, 
JOS.15.29	Baalah and Iim and Ezem, 
JOS.15.30	and Eltolad and Chesil and Hormah, 
JOS.15.31	and Ziklag and Madmannah and Sansannah, 
JOS.15.32	and Lebaoth and Shilhim and Ain and Rimmon; in all twenty-nine cities with their villages.
JOS.15.33	In the lowland: Eshtaol and Zorah and Ashnah, 
JOS.15.34	and Zanoah and En-gannim, Tappuah and Enam, 
JOS.15.35	Jarmuth and Adullam, Socoh and Azekah, 
JOS.15.36	and Shaaraim and Adithaim and Gederah and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages.
JOS.15.37	Zenan and Hadashah and Migdal-gad, 
JOS.15.38	and Dilean and Mizpeh and Joktheel, 
JOS.15.39	Lachish and Bozkath and Eglon, 
JOS.15.40	and Cabbon and Lahmas and Chitlish, 
JOS.15.41	and Gederoth, Beth-dagon and Naamah and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages.
JOS.15.42	Libnah and Ether and Ashan, 
JOS.15.43	and Iphtah and Ashnah and Nezib, 
JOS.15.44	and Keilah and Achzib and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages.
JOS.15.45	Ekron, with its 
JOS.15.46	from Ekron even to the sea, all that were beside Ashdod, with their villages;
JOS.15.47	Ashdod, with its towns and its villages; Gaza, with its towns and its villages; as far as the Brook of Egypt (Wadi el-Arish) and the Great [Mediterranean] Sea with its coastline.
JOS.15.48	In the hill country: Shamir and Jattir and Socoh, 
JOS.15.49	and Dannah and Kiriath-sannah (that is, Debir), 
JOS.15.50	and Anab and Eshtemoh and Anim, 
JOS.15.51	and Goshen and Holon and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages.
JOS.15.52	Arab and Dumah and Eshan, 
JOS.15.53	and Janum and Beth-tappuah and Aphekah, 
JOS.15.54	and Humtah and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), and Zior; nine cities with their villages.
JOS.15.55	Maon, Carmel and Ziph and Juttah, 
JOS.15.56	and Jezreel and Jokdeam and Zanoah, 
JOS.15.57	Kain, Gibeah and Timnah; ten cities with their villages.
JOS.15.58	Halhul, Beth-zur and Gedor, 
JOS.15.59	and Maarath and Beth-anoth and Eltekon; six cities with their villages.
JOS.15.60	Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), and Rabbah; two cities with their villages.
JOS.15.61	In the wilderness [that slopes downward toward the Dead Sea]: Beth-arabah, Middin and Secacah, 
JOS.15.62	and Nibshan and the 
JOS.15.63	But as for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the [tribe of the] sons of Judah were not able to drive them out; so the Jebusites live with the sons of Judah in Jerusalem to this day.
JOS.16.1	Then the lot (allotment) for the sons of Joseph went from the Jordan Valley at Jericho to the waters of Jericho on the east into the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill country to Bethel. 
JOS.16.2	Then it went from Bethel to Luz, and continued to Ataroth, the border of the Archites. 
JOS.16.3	It went down westward to the territory of the Japhletites, as far as the outskirts of lower Beth-horon, then to Gezer, and it ended at the sea.
JOS.16.4	The sons of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, received their inheritance. 
JOS.16.5	Now this was the territory of the sons of Ephraim according to their families: on the east side the border of their inheritance was Ataroth-addar, as far as upper Beth-horon. 
JOS.16.6	Then the border went westward at Michmethath on the north, and turned eastward to Taanath-shiloh and continued beyond it to the east of Janoah. 
JOS.16.7	It went down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah, touched Jericho and ended at the Jordan. 
JOS.16.8	The border continued from Tappuah westward to the Brook Kanah, and it ended at the [Mediterranean] sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim according to their families (clans), 
JOS.16.9	with the cities which were set apart for the sons of Ephraim within the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages. 
JOS.16.10	But they did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites live among Ephraim to this day, and they became forced laborers.
JOS.17.1	Now this was the lot (allotment) for the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph. To Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, were allotted Gilead and Bashan, because he was a man of war. 
JOS.17.2	So 
JOS.17.3	But Zelophehad the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, only daughters; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah. 
JOS.17.4	They came before Eleazar the priest and before Joshua the son of Nun and before the leaders and said, “The L
JOS.17.5	So ten portions fell to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan [on the east side of the river], 
JOS.17.6	because the daughters of [Zelophehad, a descendant of] Manasseh had received an inheritance among his [other] sons [whose inheritance went to their male descendants]. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.
JOS.17.7	The territory of Manasseh reached from Asher to Michmethath which was east of Shechem; then the border went southward to the inhabitants of En-tappuah. 
JOS.17.8	The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but [the city of] Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the sons of Ephraim. 
JOS.17.9	Then the border went down to the brook of Kanah, south of the brook (these cities 
JOS.17.10	The land on the south side 
JOS.17.11	Also, in Issachar and in Asher, Manasseh had Beth-shean and its towns and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; the third is Napheth. 
JOS.17.12	But the sons of Manasseh were not able to [drive out the inhabitants and] take possession of these cities, because the Canaanites persisted in living in that land. 
JOS.17.13	When the Israelites became strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out completely.
JOS.17.14	The sons of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, “Why have you given us only one lot and one portion as an inheritance, when we are a numerous people whom the L
JOS.17.15	Then Joshua replied, “If you are a numerous people, go up to the forest and clear ground for yourselves there in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim, since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you.” 
JOS.17.16	The sons of Joseph said, “The hill country is not enough for us, and all the Canaanites who live in the valley have iron chariots, both those who are in Beth-shean and its towns and those in the Valley of Jezreel.” 
JOS.17.17	Joshua said to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and to Manasseh, “You are a numerous people and have great power; you shall not have 
JOS.17.18	but the hill country shall be yours. For though it is a forest, you shall clear it and possess it to its farthest borders; for you shall drive out the Canaanites, even though they have iron chariots and though they are strong.”
JOS.18.1	Then the whole congregation of the Israelites assembled at Shiloh [in the tribal territory of Ephraim], and set up the Tent of Meeting there; and the land was subdued before them.
JOS.18.2	There remained among the Israelites 
JOS.18.3	So Joshua asked them, “How long will you put off entering to take possession of the land which the L
JOS.18.4	Provide for yourselves three men from each tribe so that I may send them, and that they may go through the land and write a description of it with regard to their [tribal] inheritance; then they shall return to me. 
JOS.18.5	They shall divide it into seven parts; [the tribe of] Judah shall remain in its territory on the south, and the 
JOS.18.6	You shall describe the land in seven divisions, and bring

JOS.18.9	So the men set out and passed through the land, and described it by cities in seven divisions in a book; and they came back to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh. 
JOS.18.10	Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the L
JOS.18.11	Now the lot (allotment) of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin came up according to their families, and the territory of their lot fell between [the tribes of] the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph. 
JOS.18.12	On the north side their border began at the Jordan, then it went up the slope of Jericho on the north, and up through the hill country westward, and it ended at the Beth-aven wilderness. 
JOS.18.13	Then the border continued southward toward Luz, to the slope of Luz (that is, Bethel); then the border went down to Ataroth-addar, by the hill that lies south of lower Beth-horon. 
JOS.18.14	The border changed course [from there] and turned around on the western side southward, from the hill that lies to the south opposite Beth-horon; it ended at Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), a city of [the tribe of] the sons of Judah. This 
JOS.18.15	The southern side was from the edge of Kiriath-jearim, and the border went on westward and went to the source of the waters of Nephtoah. 
JOS.18.16	Then the border went down to the edge of the hill overlooking the Valley of Ben-hinnom (son of Hinnom), which is at the north end of the Valley of Rephaim; and it descended to the Valley of Hinnom, south to the slope of the Jebusite, and went on down to En-rogel. 
JOS.18.17	Then it turned toward the north and went on to En-shemesh and on to Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. 
JOS.18.18	It continued to the north to the side opposite [Beth-] Arabah and went down to the Arabah. 
JOS.18.19	The border continued along to the north of the slope of Beth-hoglah; and the border ended at the northern bay of the Salt (Dead) Sea, at the south end of the Jordan. This was the southern border. 
JOS.18.20	And the Jordan River was its border on the east side. This was the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin, according to their families and according to its borders all around.
JOS.18.21	Now the cities of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho and Beth-hoglah and Emek-keziz, 
JOS.18.22	and Beth-arabah and Zemaraim and Bethel, 
JOS.18.23	and Avvim and Parah and Ophrah, 
JOS.18.24	and Chephar-ammoni and Ophni and Geba; twelve cities with their villages; 
JOS.18.25	Gibeon and Ramah and Beeroth, 
JOS.18.26	and Mizpeh and Chephirah and Mozah, 
JOS.18.27	and Rekem and Irpeel and Taralah, 
JOS.18.28	and Zelah, Haeleph and the Jebusite (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah, Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of [the tribe of] the sons of Benjamin according to their families (clans).
JOS.19.1	Then the second lot fell to Simeon, to the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their families (clans), and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the sons of Judah. 
JOS.19.2	So they had as their inheritance Beersheba or Sheba and Moladah, 
JOS.19.3	and Hazar-shual and Balah and Ezem, 
JOS.19.4	and Eltolad and Bethul and Hormah, 
JOS.19.5	and Ziklag and Beth-marcaboth and Hazar-susah, 
JOS.19.6	and Beth-lebaoth and Sharuhen; thirteen cities with their villages; 
JOS.19.7	Ain, Rimmon and Ether and Ashan; four cities with their villages; 
JOS.19.8	and all the villages which were around these cities as far as Baalath-beer, Ramah of the Negev (South country). This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their families. 
JOS.19.9	The inheritance of the sons of Simeon 
JOS.19.10	The third lot came up for [the tribe of] the sons of Zebulun according to their families. The territory of their inheritance extended to Sarid. 
JOS.19.11	Then its border went up westward and on to Maralah, and reached to Dabbesheth and reached to the brook east of Jokneam. 
JOS.19.12	Then it turned from Sarid east toward the sunrise as far as the border of Chisloth-tabor, and it proceeded to Daberath and on up to Japhia. 
JOS.19.13	From there it continued east toward the sunrise to 
JOS.19.14	The border circled it on the north to Hannathon, ending at the Valley of Iphtahel. 
JOS.19.15	Included were Kattah and Nahalal and Shimron and Idalah and Bethlehem; twelve cities with their villages. 
JOS.19.16	This was the inheritance of the sons of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages.
JOS.19.17	The fourth lot fell to [the tribe of] Issachar, to the sons of Issachar according to their families. 
JOS.19.18	Their territory included: Jezreel and Chesulloth and Shunem,

JOS.19.20	and Rabbith and Kishion and Ebez,

JOS.19.22	The border reached to Tabor and Shahazumah and Beth-shemesh, and their border ended at the Jordan; sixteen cities with their villages. 
JOS.19.23	This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Issachar according to their families, the cities and their villages.
JOS.19.24	The fifth lot fell to the tribe of the sons of Asher according to their families. 
JOS.19.25	Their territory was Helkath and Hali and Beten and Achshaph, 
JOS.19.26	and Allammelech and Amad and Mishal; and on the west it reached to Carmel and to Shihor-libnath. 
JOS.19.27	Then it turned eastward to Beth-dagon and reached Zebulun and the Valley of Iphtahel northward to Beth-emek and Neiel, and continued in the north to Cabul, 
JOS.19.28	and Ebron and Rehob and Hammon and Kanah, as far as Great Sidon. 
JOS.19.29	Then the border turned to Ramah, [reaching] to the fortified city of Tyre; and it turned to Hosah, and it ended at the [Mediterranean] sea at the region of Achzib. 
JOS.19.30	Included were Ummah, and Aphek and Rehob; twenty-two cities with their villages. 
JOS.19.31	This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.
JOS.19.32	The sixth lot fell to [the tribe of] the sons of Naphtali according to their families. 
JOS.19.33	Their border ran from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim and Adami-nekeb and Jabneel, as far as Lakkum, and it ended at the Jordan. 
JOS.19.34	Then the border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor and went from there to Hukkok; and it reached Zebulun on the south and reached Asher on the west, and to Judah toward the east at the Jordan. 
JOS.19.35	The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath and Chinnereth, 
JOS.19.36	and Adamah and Ramah and Hazor,

JOS.19.39	This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their villages.
JOS.19.40	The seventh lot fell to the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their families. 
JOS.19.41	The territory of their inheritance included Zorah and Eshtaol and Ir-shemesh,

JOS.19.47	The territory of the sons of Dan 
JOS.19.48	This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their families (clans), these cities with their villages.
JOS.19.49	When they had finished dividing the land for inheritance by its borders, the Israelites gave an inheritance among them to Joshua the son of Nun. 
JOS.19.50	According to the command of the L
JOS.19.51	These are the inheritances which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the households of the tribes of the sons of Israel distributed by lot in Shiloh before the L

JOS.20.6	He shall live in that city until he has stood before the congregation for judgment [and

JOS.20.9	These were the appointed cities for all the Israelites and for the stranger sojourning (living temporarily) among them, so that whoever killed any person unintentionally may flee there, and not die by the hand of the blood avenger until he had stood before the congregation [for judgment].

JOS.21.4	The [first] lot (allotment) came out for the families of the Kohathites. So those 
JOS.21.5	The rest of the sons of Kohath received ten cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Ephraim and from the tribe of Dan and from the half-tribe of Manasseh.
JOS.21.6	The sons of Gershon received thirteen cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Issachar and from the tribe of Asher and from the tribe of Naphtali and from the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.
JOS.21.7	The sons of Merari according to their families received twelve cities from the tribe of Reuben and from the tribe of Gad and from the tribe of Zebulun.
JOS.21.8	The sons of Israel gave by lot to the Levites these cities with their pasture lands, as the L
JOS.21.9	They gave these cities which are mentioned here by name from the tribe of the sons of Judah and from the tribe of the sons of Simeon; 
JOS.21.10	and they were for the sons of Aaron, one of the families of the Kohathites, of the sons of Levi, because the lot fell to them first. 
JOS.21.11	They gave them [the city of] Kiriath-arba, 
JOS.21.12	But the fields of the city and its villages they had given to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as his property.
JOS.21.13	So to the sons of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron, the city of refuge for anyone who committed manslaughter, with its pasture lands, and Libnah with its pasture lands, 
JOS.21.14	and Jattir with its pasture lands and Eshtemoa with its pasture lands, 
JOS.21.15	and Holon with its pasture lands and Debir with its pasture lands, 
JOS.21.16	and Ain with its pasture lands and Juttah with its pasture lands 
JOS.21.17	From the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its pasture lands, and Geba with its pasture lands, 
JOS.21.18	Anathoth with its pasture lands and Almon with its pasture lands; four cities. 
JOS.21.19	All the cities of the sons of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their pasture lands.
JOS.21.20	Then the cities from the tribe of Ephraim were allotted to the families of the sons of Kohath, the Levites, 
JOS.21.21	They gave them Shechem, the city of refuge for anyone who committed manslaughter, with its pasture lands, in the hill country of Ephraim, and Gezer with its pasture lands, 
JOS.21.22	and Kibzaim with its pasture lands and Beth-horon with its pasture lands; four cities. 
JOS.21.23	From the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with its pasture lands, Gibbethon with its pasture lands, 
JOS.21.24	Aijalon with its pasture lands, Gath-rimmon with its pasture lands; four cities. 
JOS.21.25	From the half-tribe of Manasseh, 
JOS.21.26	All the cities with their pasture lands for the families of the rest of the sons of Kohath 
JOS.21.27	To the sons of Gershon, one of the families of the Levites, 
JOS.21.28	From the tribe of Issachar, 
JOS.21.29	Jarmuth with its pasture lands, and En-gannim with its pasture lands; four cities. 
JOS.21.30	From the tribe of Asher, 
JOS.21.31	Helkath with its pasture lands and Rehob with its pasture lands; four cities. 
JOS.21.32	From the tribe of Naphtali, 
JOS.21.33	All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their pasture lands.
JOS.21.34	To the families of the sons of Merari, the rest of the Levites, 
JOS.21.35	Dimnah with its pasture lands and Nahalal with its pasture lands; four cities. 
JOS.21.36	From the tribe of Reuben, 
JOS.21.37	Kedemoth with its pasture lands and Mephaath with its pasture lands; four cities. 
JOS.21.38	From the tribe of Gad, 
JOS.21.39	Heshbon with its pasture lands and Jazer with its pasture lands; four cities in all. 
JOS.21.40	All [these were] the cities of the sons of Merari according to their families, the rest of the families of the Levites; and their lot was twelve cities.
JOS.21.41	All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the property of the sons of Israel were forty-eight cities with their pasture lands. 
JOS.21.42	These cities each had its surrounding pasture lands; so it was with all these cities.
JOS.21.43	So the L

JOS.21.45	Not one of the good promises which the L
JOS.22.1	Then Joshua called the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, 
JOS.22.2	and said to them, “You have kept all that Moses the servant of the L
JOS.22.3	You have not deserted your brothers these many days to this day, but have [carefully] kept the obligation of the commandment of the L
JOS.22.4	And now the L
JOS.22.5	Only be very careful 
JOS.22.6	So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents.
JOS.22.7	Now to the one-half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given 
JOS.22.8	and he said to them, “Return to your tents with great riches and with very much livestock, with silver, gold, bronze, iron, and with very many clothes; divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers (fellow tribesmen).” 
JOS.22.9	So the sons (descendants) of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned 
JOS.22.10	When they came to the region of the Jordan which is in the land of Canaan, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an altar there by the Jordan, an altar that was great to behold. 
JOS.22.11	And the [other] sons of Israel heard it said, “Look, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an 
JOS.22.12	When the sons of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the Israelites gathered at Shiloh to make war against them.
JOS.22.13	Then the sons of Israel sent Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest to the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead, 
JOS.22.14	and with him ten leaders, one leader from each father’s household from each of the tribes of Israel; and each one was the head of his father’s household among the thousands of Israel. 
JOS.22.15	They came to the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead, and they said to them, 
JOS.22.16	“This is what the entire congregation of the L
JOS.22.17	Is the wrongdoing (idolatry) of Peor not enough for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day, even though the affliction [in which twenty-four thousand died] came on the congregation of the L
JOS.22.18	that you would turn away this day from following the L
JOS.22.19	If, however, the land of your possession is unclean, then cross into the land of the possession of the L
JOS.22.20	Did not Achan the son of Zerah act unfaithfully in the things under the ban, and [as a result God’s] wrath came on the entire congregation of Israel? And that man did not perish alone in his wrongdoing.’ ”
JOS.22.21	Then the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered and said to the heads of the families of Israel, 
JOS.22.22	“The Mighty One, God, the L
JOS.22.23	If we have built an altar for ourselves to turn away from following the L
JOS.22.24	But in truth we have done this out of concern, for a reason, saying, ‘In time to come your sons (descendants) may say to our sons, “What 
JOS.22.25	For the L
JOS.22.26	“So we said, ‘Let us prepare 
JOS.22.27	but to be a witness between us and you and between the generations after us, that we are to perform the service of the L
JOS.22.28	So we said, ‘If your descendants should say this to us or to our descendants in time to come, then we can reply, “See the copy of the altar of the L
JOS.22.29	Far be it from us that we should rebel against the L
JOS.22.30	So when Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the congregation and heads of the families of Israel who were with him, heard the words which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the sons of Manasseh spoke, it 
JOS.22.31	Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the sons of Manasseh, “Today we know that the L
JOS.22.32	Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest and the leaders returned from the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad, from the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the sons of Israel, and brought back word to them. 
JOS.22.33	The report 
JOS.22.34	The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad called the altar 
JOS.23.1	A long time after that, when the L
JOS.23.2	that Joshua called all Israel, their elders and their heads and their judges and their officers, and said to them, “I am old and advanced in years. 
JOS.23.3	And you have seen all that the L
JOS.23.4	See, I have allotted to you these nations that remain as an inheritance for your tribes, with all the nations which I have cut off, from the Jordan [on the east] to the Great [Mediterranean] Sea toward the setting sun. 
JOS.23.5	The L
JOS.23.6	Be steadfast 
JOS.23.7	so that you do not associate with these nations which remain among you, or mention the name of their gods, or make anyone swear [an oath by them], or serve them, or bow down to them. 
JOS.23.8	But you are to cling to the L
JOS.23.9	For the L
JOS.23.10	One of your men puts to flight a thousand, for the L
JOS.23.11	So be very careful 
JOS.23.12	For if you ever turn back and cling to the rest of these nations, these that are left among you, and intermarry with them, so that you associate with them and they with you, 
JOS.23.13	know 
JOS.23.14	“Now behold, today I am going the way of all the earth, and you know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one word of all the good words which the L
JOS.23.15	It shall come about that just as every good word which the L

JOS.24.1	Then Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers; they presented themselves before God. 
JOS.24.2	Joshua said to all the people, “This is what the L
JOS.24.3	Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the [Euphrates] River and led him through all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his descendants, and I gave him Isaac. 
JOS.24.4	To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau, and to Esau I gave [the hill country of] Mount Seir to possess; but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt. 
JOS.24.5	Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt by what I did in its midst; and afterward I brought you out. 
JOS.24.6	Then I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea. 
JOS.24.7	When they cried out to the L
JOS.24.8	Then I brought you into the land of the Amorites who lived on the other side of the Jordan, and they fought with you; and I gave them into your hand, and you took possession of their land and I destroyed them before you. 
JOS.24.9	Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel, and he sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you. 
JOS.24.10	But I would not listen to Balaam. Therefore he had to bless you, so I saved you from Balak’s hand. 
JOS.24.11	You crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho; and the citizens of Jericho fought against you, as did the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Girgashite, the Hivite and the Jebusite; and so I gave them into your hand. 
JOS.24.12	I sent the hornet [that is, the terror of you] before you, which drove the two kings of the Amorites out before you; but it was not by your sword or by your bow. 
JOS.24.13	I gave you a land for which you did not labor, and cities which you did not build, and you live in them; you eat from vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant.’
JOS.24.14	“Now, therefore, fear the L
JOS.24.15	If it is unacceptable in your sight to serve the L
JOS.24.16	The people answered, “Far be it from us to abandon (reject) the L
JOS.24.17	for the L
JOS.24.18	The L
JOS.24.19	Then Joshua said to the people, “You will not be able to serve the L
JOS.24.20	If you do abandon (reject) the L
JOS.24.21	The people said to Joshua, “No, but we will serve [only] the L
JOS.24.22	Joshua then said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen for yourselves the L
JOS.24.23	“Now then, remove the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your hearts toward the L
JOS.24.24	The people said to Joshua, “We will serve the L
JOS.24.25	So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made for them a statute and an ordinance at Shechem. 
JOS.24.26	And Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God. Then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak that was in [the courtyard of] the sanctuary of the L
JOS.24.27	Joshua then said to all the people, “Look, this stone shall serve as a witness against us, for it has heard all the words of the L
JOS.24.28	Then Joshua sent the people away, each to [the territory of] his inheritance.
JOS.24.29	It happened after these things that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the L
JOS.24.30	They buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash.
JOS.24.31	Israel served the L
JOS.24.32	Now they buried the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up from Egypt, at Shechem, in the plot of land which Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money; and it became the inheritance of the sons of Joseph. 
JOS.24.33	And Eleazar [the priest], the son of Aaron died; and they buried him at Gibeah [on the hill] of Phinehas his son, which had been given to him in the hill country of Ephraim.
JDG.1.1	Now it came about after the death of Joshua, that the 
JDG.1.2	And the L
JDG.1.3	And [the tribe of the sons of] Judah said to [the tribe of the sons of] Simeon his brother, “Come up with me into my allotted territory, so that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your allotted territory.” So Simeon went with him. 
JDG.1.4	Then Judah went up, and the L
JDG.1.5	Then they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek and fought against him, and they struck down in defeat the Canaanites and the Perizzites. 
JDG.1.6	But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his big toes. 
JDG.1.7	Adoni-bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to gather up 
JDG.1.8	Then the sons of Judah fought against [Jebusite] Jerusalem and 
JDG.1.9	Afterward the sons of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, in the Negev (South country) and in the lowland. 
JDG.1.10	So Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba); and they defeated Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai.
JDG.1.11	From there [the tribe of] Judah went against the inhabitants of Debir (the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher [city of books and scribes]). 
JDG.1.12	And Caleb said, “Whoever attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will even give him my daughter Achsah as a wife.” 
JDG.1.13	Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, captured it; so he gave him his daughter Achsah as a wife. 
JDG.1.14	When she came 
JDG.1.15	She said to him, “Give me a blessing; since you have given me the land of the Negev (South country), give me springs of water, too.” So Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
JDG.1.16	The sons of [
JDG.1.17	Then [the warriors of the tribe of] Judah went with [the warriors of the tribe of] Simeon his brother, and they struck the Canaanites living in Zephath and utterly destroyed it. So the city was called Hormah (destruction). 
JDG.1.18	Also [the warriors of] Judah captured Gaza with its territory and Ashkelon with its territory and Ekron with its territory. 
JDG.1.19	The L
JDG.1.20	Then they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said, and he drove out from there the three sons of Anak. 
JDG.1.21	But the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; so the Jebusites have lived with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
JDG.1.22	The 
JDG.1.23	The house of Joseph spied out Bethel (now the name of the city was formerly Luz). 
JDG.1.24	The spies saw a man coming out of the city and they said to him, “Please show us the entrance to the city and we will treat you kindly.” 
JDG.1.25	So he showed them the entrance to the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and all his family go free. 
JDG.1.26	The man went into the 
JDG.1.27	But [the tribe of] Manasseh did not take possession of Beth-shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; so the Canaanites remained in that land. 
JDG.1.28	It happened when Israel became strong, that they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out completely.
JDG.1.29	Neither did [the warriors of] Ephraim drive out the Canaanites who were living in Gezer; so the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.
JDG.1.30	[The warriors of the tribe of] Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or of Nahalol; so the Canaanites lived among them and were put to forced labor.
JDG.1.31	[The warriors of the tribe of] Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Ahlab, or of Achzib, or of Helbah, or of Aphik, or of Rehob. 
JDG.1.32	So the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, because they did not drive them out.
JDG.1.33	Neither did [the warriors of] Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but they lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; and the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became forced labor for them.
JDG.1.34	Then the 
JDG.1.35	yet the Amorites persisted in living on Mount Heres (the mountain of the sun), in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim; but when the power of the house (descendants) of Joseph became strong 
JDG.1.36	The border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from

JDG.2.7	The people served the L

JDG.2.9	And they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. 
JDG.2.10	Also, all [the people of] that generation were gathered to their fathers [in death]; and another generation arose after them who did not know (recognize, understand) the L
JDG.2.11	Then the Israelites did evil in the sight of the L

JDG.3.3	 the five lords (governors) of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon to the entrance of Hamath. 
JDG.3.4	They were [allowed to remain] for the testing of Israel, to determine whether Israel would listen to 
JDG.3.5	And the Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites; 
JDG.3.6	and they took their daughters for themselves as wives and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their [pagan] gods.
JDG.3.7	And the Israelites did evil in the sight of the L
JDG.3.8	So the anger of the L
JDG.3.9	But when the Israelites cried out to the L
JDG.3.10	The Spirit of the L
JDG.3.11	And the land was at rest [from oppression for] forty years. Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
JDG.3.12	Now the Israelites again did evil in the sight of the L
JDG.3.13	And Eglon gathered to him the sons of Ammon and Amalek, and went and struck down Israel [in defeat], and they took possession of the City of Palm Trees (Jericho). 
JDG.3.14	And the Israelites served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years.
JDG.3.15	But when the Israelites cried out to the L
JDG.3.16	Now Ehud made for himself a sword a

JDG.3.18	And when Ehud had finished presenting the

JDG.3.20	Ehud came to him as he was sitting alone in his [private] cool upper chamber, and Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you.” And the king got up from his seat. 
JDG.3.21	Then Ehud reached out with his left hand and took the sword from his right thigh, and plunged it into Eglon’s belly. 
JDG.3.22	And the hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, because Ehud did not draw the sword out of his belly; and the refuse came out. 
JDG.3.23	Then Ehud went out into the vestibule and shut the doors of the upper chamber behind him, and locked 
JDG.3.24	When Ehud departed, Eglon’s servants came. And when they saw that the doors of the upper room were locked, they said, “He is only

JDG.3.26	Now Ehud escaped while they lingered, and he passed beyond the sculptured stones and escaped to Seirah. 
JDG.3.27	When he had arrived, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the sons of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he was in front of them. 
JDG.3.28	And he said to them, “Pursue 
JDG.3.29	They struck down at that time about ten thousand Moabite men, all strong, courageous men; not a man escaped. 
JDG.3.30	So Moab was subdued

JDG.4.4	Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time. 
JDG.4.5	She used to sit [to hear and decide disputes] under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the Israelites came up to her for judgment. 
JDG.4.6	Now she sent 
JDG.4.7	I will draw out Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his infantry to meet you at the river Kishon, and I will hand him over to you.’ ” 
JDG.4.8	Then Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.” 
JDG.4.9	She said, “I will certainly go with you; nevertheless, 
JDG.4.10	And Barak summoned [the fighting men of the tribes of] Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and ten thousand men went up 
JDG.4.11	Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, from the sons of Hobab the 
JDG.4.12	When someone told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor, 
JDG.4.13	Sisera called together all his chariots, nine hundred iron chariots, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth-hagoyim to the river Kishon. 
JDG.4.14	Deborah said to Barak, “Arise! For this is the day when the L

JDG.4.16	But Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth-hagoyim, and the entire army of Sisera fell by the sword; not even one man was left.
JDG.4.17	But Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. 
JDG.4.18	Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, “Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me! Have no fear.” So he turned aside to her [and went] into the tent, and she covered him with a rug. 
JDG.4.19	And he said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink because I am thirsty.” And she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink; then she covered him. 
JDG.4.20	And he said to her, “Stand at the door of the tent, and if any man comes and asks you, ‘Is there anyone here?’ tell him, ‘No.’ ” 
JDG.4.21	But Jael, Heber’s wife, took a tent peg and a hammer in her hand, and came up quietly to him and drove the peg through his temple, and it went through into the ground; for he was sound asleep and exhausted. So he died. 
JDG.4.22	And behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking.” And he entered [her tent] with her, and behold Sisera lay dead with the tent peg in his temple.
JDG.4.23	So on that day God subdued 
JDG.4.24	And the hand of the sons of Israel pressed down heavier and heavier on Jabin king of Canaan, until they had destroyed him.
JDG.5.1	Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,
JDG.5.2	“For the leaders who took the lead in Israel,
JDG.5.2	For the people who volunteered [for battle],

JDG.5.5	The mountains quaked at the presence of the L
JDG.5.6	“In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath,
JDG.5.6	In the days of Jael, the highways were deserted,
JDG.5.6	And travelers went by roundabout ways.
JDG.5.7	The villagers ceased 
JDG.5.7	Until I, Deborah, arose,
JDG.5.7	Until I arose, a mother in Israel.
JDG.5.8	They chose new gods;
JDG.5.8	Then war was in the gates.
JDG.5.8	Was there a shield or spear seen

JDG.5.15	As Issachar, so was Barak;
JDG.5.15	Into the valley they rushed at his heels;
JDG.5.15	Among the divisions of Reuben
JDG.5.15	There were great searchings of heart.
JDG.5.16	Why [Reuben] did you linger among the

JDG.5.16	Among the divisions of Reuben
JDG.5.16	There were great searchings of heart.
JDG.5.17	Gilead remained beyond the Jordan;
JDG.5.17	And why did Dan live as an alien on ships?
JDG.5.17	Asher sat [still] on the seacoast,
JDG.5.17	And remained by its landings.
JDG.5.17	[These did not come to battle for God’s people.]
JDG.5.18	But Zebulun was a people who risked their lives to the [point of] death;
JDG.5.18	Naphtali also, on the heights of the field.
JDG.5.19	“The kings came and fought;
JDG.5.19	Then the kings of Canaan fought

JDG.5.19	Spoils of silver they did not obtain.
JDG.5.20	From the heavens the stars fought,

JDG.5.25	She brought him curds in a magnificent bowl.
JDG.5.26	She reached out her [left] hand for the tent peg,
JDG.5.26	And her right hand for the workmen’s hammer.
JDG.5.26	Then she struck Sisera, she smashed his head;
JDG.5.26	And she shattered and pierced his temple.
JDG.5.27	He bowed, he fell, he lay [still] at her feet;
JDG.5.27	At her feet he bowed, he fell;
JDG.5.27	Where he bowed, there he fell dead.
JDG.5.28	“Out of the window she looked down and lamented (cried out in a shrill voice),
JDG.5.28	The mother of Sisera through the lattice,
JDG.5.28	‘Why is his chariot delayed in coming?
JDG.5.28	Why have the hoofbeats of his chariots delayed?’
JDG.5.29	Her wise ladies answered her,
JDG.5.29	Indeed, she repeated her words to herself,
JDG.5.30	‘Are they not finding and dividing the spoil?
JDG.5.30	A maiden (concubine) or two for every man;
JDG.5.30	A spoil of dyed garments for Sisera,

JDG.5.30	Two pieces of dyed garments embroidered for the neck of the plunderer?’
JDG.5.31	So let all Your enemies perish, O L
JDG.5.31	But let those who love Him be like the rising of the sun in its might.”
JDG.5.31	And the land was at rest for forty years.
JDG.6.1	Then the Israelites did evil in the sight of the L
JDG.6.2	The [powerful] hand of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of Midian the sons of Israel made for themselves the dens (hideouts) which were in the mountains, and the caves and the [mountain] strongholds. 
JDG.6.3	For it was whenever Israel had sown [their seed] that the Midianites would come up with the Amalekites and the people of the east and go up against them. 
JDG.6.4	So they would camp against them and destroy the crops of the land as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance in Israel as well as no sheep, ox, or donkey. 
JDG.6.5	For they would come up with their livestock and their tents, and they would come in as numerous as locusts; both they and their camels were innumerable. So they came into the land to devastate it. 
JDG.6.6	So Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites, and the Israelites cried out to the L
JDG.6.7	Now it came about when they cried out to the L
JDG.6.8	that the L
JDG.6.9	And I rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you and gave you their land, 
JDG.6.10	and I said to you, “I am the L

JDG.6.15	But Gideon said to Him, “Please Lord, how am I to rescue Israel? Behold, my family is the least [significant] in Manasseh, and I am the youngest (smallest) in my father’s house.” 
JDG.6.16	The L
JDG.6.17	Gideon replied to Him, “If I have found any favor in Your sight, then show me a sign that it is You who speaks with me. 
JDG.6.18	Please do not depart from here until I come back to You, and bring my offering and place it before You.” And He said, “I will wait until you return.”
JDG.6.19	Then Gideon went and prepared a young goat and unleavened bread from an ephah of flour. The meat he put in a basket and the broth in a pot, and he brought 
JDG.6.20	The Angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and unleavened bread and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth [over them].” And he did so. 
JDG.6.21	Then the Angel of the L
JDG.6.22	When Gideon realized [without any doubt] that He was the Angel of the L

JDG.6.24	Then Gideon built an altar there to the L
JDG.6.25	Now on that same night the L
JDG.6.26	and build an altar to the L
JDG.6.27	Then Gideon took ten men of his servants and did just as the L
JDG.6.28	Early the next morning when the men of the city got up, they discovered that the altar of Baal was torn down, and the Asherah which was beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar which had been built. 
JDG.6.29	So they said to one another, “Who has done this thing?” When they searched about and inquired, they were told, “Gideon the son of Joash did it.” 
JDG.6.30	Then the men of the city said to Joash, “Bring out your son, so that he may be executed, because he has torn down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah which was beside it.” 
JDG.6.31	But Joash said to all who stood against him, “Will you 
JDG.6.32	Therefore on that day he named Gideon Jerubbaal, 
JDG.6.33	Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the east assembled together; and they crossed over [the Jordan] and camped in the Valley of Jezreel. 
JDG.6.34	So the Spirit of the L
JDG.6.35	He sent messengers throughout [the tribe of] Manasseh, and the fighting men were also called together to follow him; and he sent messengers to [the tribes of] Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they came up to meet them.
JDG.6.36	Then Gideon said to God, “If You are going to rescue Israel through me, as You have spoken, 
JDG.6.37	behold, I will put a fleece of [freshly sheared] wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece, and it is dry on all the ground [around it], then I will know that You will rescue Israel through me, as You have said.” 
JDG.6.38	And it was so. When he got up early the next morning and squeezed the dew out of the fleece, he wrung from it a bowl full of water. 
JDG.6.39	Then Gideon said to God, “Do not let your anger burn against me, so that I may speak once more. Please let me make a test once more with the fleece; now let only the fleece be dry, and let there be dew on all the ground.” 
JDG.6.40	God did so that night; for it was dry only on the fleece, and there was dew on all the ground [around it].
JDG.7.1	Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him got up early and camped beside the spring of Harod; and the camp of Midian was north of them by the hill of Moreh in the valley.
JDG.7.2	Then the L
JDG.7.3	So now, proclaim in the hearing of the people, ‘Whoever is afraid and trembling, let him turn back and leave Mount Gilead.’ ” So twenty-two thousand men returned [home], but ten thousand remained.
JDG.7.4	Then the L
JDG.7.5	So he brought the people down to the water, and the L
JDG.7.6	Now the number of those who lapped [the water], putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men, but all the rest of the people kneeled down to drink water. 
JDG.7.7	And the L
JDG.7.8	So the three hundred men took people’s provisions [for the journey] and their trumpets [made of rams’ horns] in their hands. And Gideon sent [away] all the 
JDG.7.9	Now on that same night the L
JDG.7.10	But if you are afraid to go down [by yourself], go with Purah your servant down to the camp, 
JDG.7.11	and you will hear what they say; and afterward 
JDG.7.12	Now the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the sons of the east were lying [camped] in the valley, as countless as locusts; and their camels were without number, as numerous as the sand on the seashore. 
JDG.7.13	When Gideon arrived, 
JDG.7.14	And his friend replied, “This [dream] is nothing less than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel. God has given Midian and the entire camp into his hand.”
JDG.7.15	When Gideon heard the account of the dream and its interpretation, he bowed down in worship. Then he returned to the camp of Israel and said, “Arise, for the L
JDG.7.16	He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put trumpets and empty pitchers into the hands of all of them, with torches inside the pitchers. 
JDG.7.17	And he said to them, “Look at me, then do likewise. When I come to the edge of the camp, do just as I do. 
JDG.7.18	When I and all who are with me blow the trumpet (ram’s horn), then all around the camp you also blow the trumpets and shout, ‘For the L
JDG.7.19	So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the edge of the camp at the beginning of the 
JDG.7.20	When three companies blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers, they held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow, and they shouted, “A sword for the L
JDG.7.21	Then each stood in his place around the camp; and the entire [Midianite] army ran, crying out as they fled. 
JDG.7.22	When Gideon’s men blew the three hundred trumpets, the L
JDG.7.23	The men of Israel were summoned together from [the tribes of] Naphtali and Asher and all Manasseh, and they pursued Midian.
JDG.7.24	Then Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of [the tribe of] Ephraim, saying, “Come down against the Midianites and take [control of] the waters before them [thereby cutting off the Midianites], as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan [River].” So all the men of Ephraim were assembled together and they took 
JDG.7.25	Then the men of Ephraim took the two leaders of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and they killed Zeeb at the wine press of Zeeb, and pursued Midian; and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon from across the Jordan.
JDG.8.1	And the men of [the tribe of] Ephraim said to Gideon, “What is this thing that you have done to us, not calling us when you went to fight with Midian?” And they quarreled with him vehemently. 
JDG.8.2	But he said to them, “What have I done now [that is so significant] in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning (leftovers) 
JDG.8.3	God has given the leaders of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb into your hands; and what was I able to do in comparison with you?” Then their anger toward him subsided when he made this statement.
JDG.8.4	So Gideon came to the Jordan and crossed over [the river], he and the three hundred men who were with him—exhausted, yet [still] pursuing [the enemy]. 
JDG.8.5	He said to the men of Succoth, “Please give loaves of bread to the people who are following me since they are exhausted, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.” 
JDG.8.6	But the leaders of Succoth said, “Are Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hands, that we should give bread to your army?” 
JDG.8.7	Gideon said, “For that [response], when the L
JDG.8.8	He went from there up to Penuel and spoke similarly to them; and the men of Penuel answered him just as the men of Succoth had answered. 
JDG.8.9	So Gideon said also to the men of Penuel, “When I come again in peace, I will tear down this tower.”
JDG.8.10	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their armies, about fifteen thousand [fighting] men, all who were left of the entire army of the sons of the east; for a hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had fallen. 
JDG.8.11	Gideon went up by the route of those who lived in tents to the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and he attacked their camp when the camp was unsuspecting. 
JDG.8.12	When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and terrified the entire army.
JDG.8.13	Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres. 
JDG.8.14	He captured a young man of Succoth and questioned him. And 
JDG.8.15	He came to the men of Succoth and said, “Look here, Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me, saying, ‘Are Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are exhausted?’ ” 
JDG.8.16	He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briars, and with them he 
JDG.8.17	He tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.
JDG.8.18	Then Gideon said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tabor?” And they replied, “They were like you, each one of them resembled the son of a king.” 
JDG.8.19	He said, “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the L
JDG.8.20	So [to humiliate them] Gideon said to Jether his firstborn, “Stand up, and kill them!” But the youth did not draw his sword, because he was afraid, for he was still [just] a boy. 
JDG.8.21	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Rise up yourself and strike us; for as the man is, so is his strength.” So Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescent amulets that were on their camels’ necks.
JDG.8.22	Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule [as king] over us, both you and your son, also your son’s son, for you have rescued us from the hand of Midian.” 
JDG.8.23	But Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; the L
JDG.8.24	And Gideon said to them, “I would make a request of you, that each one of you give me an earring from his spoil.” For the Midianites had gold earrings, because they were 
JDG.8.25	They answered, “We will certainly give them 
JDG.8.26	And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was 
JDG.8.27	Gideon made [all the golden earrings into] an ephod [a sacred, high priest’s garment], and put it in his city of Ophrah, and all Israel 
JDG.8.28	So Midian was subdued 
JDG.8.29	Jerubbaal (Gideon) the son of Joash went and lived in his own house. 
JDG.8.30	Now Gideon had seventy sons born to him, because he had many wives. 
JDG.8.31	And his 
JDG.8.32	Gideon the son of Joash died at a good advanced age and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
JDG.8.33	Then it came about, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the Israelites again played the prostitute with the Baals, and made Baal-berith their god. 
JDG.8.34	And the Israelites did not remember the L
JDG.8.35	nor did they show kindness to the family of Jerubbaal (
JDG.9.1	Now Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal (Gideon) went to Shechem to his mother’s relatives, and said to them and to the whole clan of the household of his mother’s father, 
JDG.9.2	“Speak now in the hearing of all the leaders of Shechem, ‘Which is better for you, that seventy men, all of the sons of Jerubbaal rule over you, or that one man rule over you?’ Also, remember that I am your 
JDG.9.3	So his mother’s relatives spoke all these words concerning him so that all the leaders of Shechem could hear; and their hearts were inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, “He is our relative.” 
JDG.9.4	And they gave him seventy 
JDG.9.5	Then he went to his father’s house at Ophrah and murdered his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men, [in a public execution] on one stone. But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left 
JDG.9.6	All the men of Shechem and all of 
JDG.9.7	When they told Jotham, he went and stood at the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted to them, “Hear me, O men of Shechem, so that God may hear you. 
JDG.9.8	Once the trees went forth to anoint a king over them, and they said to the olive tree, ‘Reign over us!’ 
JDG.9.9	But the olive tree said to them, ‘Should I give up my fatness by which God and men are honored, and go to wave over the trees?’ 
JDG.9.10	Then the trees said to the fig tree, ‘You come and reign over us!’ 
JDG.9.11	But the fig tree said to them, ‘Should I give up my sweetness and my good fruit, and go to wave over the trees?’ 
JDG.9.12	Then the trees said to the vine, ‘You come and reign over us.’ 
JDG.9.13	And the vine replied, ‘Should I give up my new wine, which makes God and men happy, and go to wave over the trees?’ 
JDG.9.14	Then all the trees said to the bramble, ‘You come and reign over us.’ 
JDG.9.15	So the bramble said to the trees, ‘If in truth you are anointing me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon.’
JDG.9.16	“Now then, if you acted in truth and integrity when you made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have dealt with him as he deserved— 
JDG.9.17	for my father fought for you and risked his life and rescued you from the hand of Midian; 
JDG.9.18	but you have risen against my father’s house today and have murdered his sons, seventy men, on one stone, and have made Abimelech, son of his maidservant, king over the people of Shechem, because he is your relative— 
JDG.9.19	if then you have acted in truth and integrity with Jerubbaal and his house this day, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you. 
JDG.9.20	But if not, may fire come out from Abimelech and devour the people of Shechem and Beth-millo; and may fire come out from the people of Shechem and Beth-millo, and devour Abimelech.” 
JDG.9.21	Then Jotham escaped and fled, and went to Beer and lived there because of Abimelech his brother.
JDG.9.22	Abimelech ruled over Israel for three years. 
JDG.9.23	Then God sent an 
JDG.9.24	so that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal (Gideon) might come [on the guilty], and that their [innocent] blood might be laid on Abimelech their brother, who had killed them, and on the leaders of Shechem, who strengthened his hands (encouraged him) to kill his brothers. 
JDG.9.25	The leaders of Shechem set men in ambush against Abimelech on the mountaintops, and they robbed all who passed by them along the road; and it was reported to Abimelech.
JDG.9.26	Now Gaal the son of Ebed came with his relatives, and moved into Shechem; and the leaders of Shechem trusted him. 
JDG.9.27	They went out into the field, gathered the grapes of their vineyard and trod them, and held a festival; and they entered the house of their god, and they ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech. 
JDG.9.28	Gaal the son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not [merely] the son of Jerubbaal and is Zebul not his lieutenant? Serve the men of Hamor the father (founder) of Shechem. Why then should we serve Abimelech? 
JDG.9.29	If only this people were under my authority! Then I would remove Abimelech and say to him, ‘Increase [the size of] your army and come out [to fight].’ ”
JDG.9.30	When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger burned. 
JDG.9.31	He sent messengers to Abimelech secretly, saying, “Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his relatives have come to Shechem; and they are stirring up the city against you. 
JDG.9.32	Now then, get up during the night, you and the people who are with you, and set up an ambush in the field. 
JDG.9.33	Then in the morning, at sunrise, you will get up early and rush upon 
JDG.9.34	So Abimelech and all the people who were with him got up during the night, and set up an ambush against Shechem, in four companies. 
JDG.9.35	Now Gaal the son of Ebed came out and stood in the entrance of the city gate; then Abimelech and the people who were with him got up from the ambush. 
JDG.9.36	When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Look, people are coming down from the mountaintops.” But Zebul said to him, “You are 
JDG.9.37	Gaal spoke again and said, “Look! People are coming down from the highest part of the land, and one company is coming by way of the sorcerers’ oak tree.” 
JDG.9.38	Then Zebul said to Gaal, “Where is your [boasting] mouth now, you who said, ‘Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?’ Is this not the people whom you despised? Go out now and fight with them!” 
JDG.9.39	So Gaal went out ahead of the leaders of Shechem and fought with Abimelech. 
JDG.9.40	Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him; and many fell wounded as far as the entrance of the gate. 
JDG.9.41	Then Abimelech stayed at Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his relatives so that they could not remain in Shechem.
JDG.9.42	The next day the people went out to the field, and it was reported to Abimelech. 
JDG.9.43	So he took his people and divided them into three companies, and set an ambush in the field; and he looked and saw the people coming out of the city. And he rose up against them and struck them down. 
JDG.9.44	Then Abimelech and the company with him advanced forward and stood in the entrance of the city gate; the two other companies attacked all who were in the field and killed them. 
JDG.9.45	Abimelech fought against the city that entire day. He took the city and killed the people who were in it; he demolished the city and 
JDG.9.46	When all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem heard about it, they entered the inner chamber (stronghold) of the 
JDG.9.47	Abimelech was told that all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem were assembled together. 
JDG.9.48	So Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a branch from the trees, picked it up, and laid it on his shoulder. And he said to the people with him, “What you have seen me do, hurry and do just as I have done.” 
JDG.9.49	So everyone of the people also cut down his branch and followed Abimelech, and they put 
JDG.9.50	Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and camped against Thebez and took it. 
JDG.9.51	But there was a strong (fortified) tower in the center of the city, and all the men and women with all the leaders of the city fled to it and shut themselves in; and they went up on the roof of the tower. 
JDG.9.52	So Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it, and approached the entrance of the tower to burn it down with fire. 
JDG.9.53	But a certain woman threw an upper millstone [down] on Abimelech’s head and crushed his skull. 
JDG.9.54	Then he called quickly to the young man who was his armor bearer, and said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me, so that it will not be said of me, ‘A woman killed him.’ ” So the young man pierced him through, and he died. 
JDG.9.55	When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, each departed to his home. 
JDG.9.56	In this way God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech, which he had done to his father [Jerubbaal] by killing his seventy brothers. 
JDG.9.57	Also God repaid all the wickedness of the men of Shechem on their heads, and the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal (Gideon) came upon them.
JDG.10.1	After Abimelech died, Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, arose to save Israel; and he lived in Shamir, in the hill country of Ephraim. 
JDG.10.2	Tola judged Israel for twenty-three years; then he died and was buried in Shamir.
JDG.10.3	After him, Jair the Gileadite arose, and he judged Israel for twenty-two years. 
JDG.10.4	He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys, and they had thirty towns in the land of Gilead that are called Havvoth-jair (towns of Jair) to this day. 
JDG.10.5	And Jair died and was buried in Kamon.
JDG.10.6	Then the Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the L

JDG.10.9	The Ammonites crossed the Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin, and the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was greatly distressed.
JDG.10.10	Then the Israelites cried out to the L
JDG.10.11	The L
JDG.10.12	Also when the Sidonians, the Amalekites, and the Maonites oppressed 
JDG.10.13	Yet you have abandoned (rejected) Me and served other gods; therefore I will no longer rescue you. 
JDG.10.14	Go, cry out to the gods you have chosen; let them rescue you in your time of distress.” 
JDG.10.15	The Israelites said to the L
JDG.10.16	So they removed the foreign gods from among them and served the L
JDG.10.17	Then the Ammonites were assembled together and they camped in Gilead. And the sons of Israel assembled and camped at Mizpah. 
JDG.10.18	The people, the leaders of Gilead (Israel) said to one another, “Who is the man who will begin to fight against the Ammonites? He shall become head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”
JDG.11.1	Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a brave warrior, but he was the son of a prostitute. Gilead was the father of Jephthah. 
JDG.11.2	Gilead’s wife bore him sons, and when his wife’s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out and said to him, “You shall not have an inheritance in our father’s house, because you are the son of another woman.” 
JDG.11.3	Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob; and worthless 
JDG.11.4	Now it happened after a while that the Ammonites fought against Israel. 
JDG.11.5	When the Ammonites fought against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob; 
JDG.11.6	and they said to Jephthah, “Come and be our leader, so that we may fight against the Ammonites.” 
JDG.11.7	But Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “Did you not hate me and drive me from the house of my father? Why have you come to me now when you are in trouble?” 
JDG.11.8	The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “This is why we have turned to you now: that you may go with us and fight the Ammonites and become head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.” 
JDG.11.9	So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “If you take me back [home] to fight against the Ammonites and the L
JDG.11.10	The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “The L
JDG.11.11	So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and leader over them. And Jephthah 
JDG.11.12	Now Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites, saying, “What is [the problem] between you and me, that you have come against me to fight in my land?” 
JDG.11.13	The Ammonites’ king replied to the messengers of Jephthah, “It is because Israel took away 
JDG.11.14	But Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the Ammonites, 
JDG.11.15	and they said to him, “This is what Jephthah says: ‘Israel did not take the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites. 
JDG.11.16	For when they came up from Egypt, Israel walked through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh; 
JDG.11.17	then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, “Please let us pass through your land,” but the king of Edom would not listen. Also they sent 
JDG.11.18	Then they went through the wilderness and went around the land of Edom and the land of Moab, and came to the east side of the land of Moab, and they camped on the other side of the [river] Arnon; but they did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was the [northern] boundary of Moab. 
JDG.11.19	Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon, and Israel said to him, “Please let us pass through your land to our place.” 
JDG.11.20	But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory; so Sihon gathered together all his people and camped at Jahaz and fought against Israel. 
JDG.11.21	The L
JDG.11.22	They took possession of all the territory of the Amorites, from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok, and from the wilderness [westward] as far as the Jordan. 
JDG.11.23	And now the L

JDG.11.25	Now are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever go to war against them? 
JDG.11.26	While Israel lived in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities along the banks of the Arnon for three hundred years, why did you not recover your lost lands during that time? 
JDG.11.27	So I have not sinned against you, but you are doing me wrong by making war against me; may the L
JDG.11.28	But the king of the Ammonites disregarded the message of Jephthah, which he sent to him.
JDG.11.29	Then the Spirit of the L
JDG.11.30	Jephthah made a vow to the L
JDG.11.31	then whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the Ammonites, it shall be the L
JDG.11.32	Then Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites to fight with them; and the L
JDG.11.33	And from Aroer to the entrance of Minnith he struck them, twenty cities, and as far as Abel-keramim (brook by the vineyard), with a very great defeat. So the Ammonites were subdued 
JDG.11.34	Then Jephthah came to his house at Mizpah, and this is what he saw: his daughter coming out to meet him with tambourines and with dancing. And she was his only child; except for her he had no son or daughter. 
JDG.11.35	And when he saw her, he tore his clothes [in grief] and said, “Alas, my daughter! You have brought me great disaster, and you are the cause of ruin to me; for I have 
JDG.11.36	And she said to him, “My father, you have made a vow to the L
JDG.11.37	And she said to her father, “Let this 
JDG.11.38	And he said, “Go.” So he sent her away for two months; and she left with her companions, and wept over her virginity on the mountains. 
JDG.11.39	At the end of two months she returned to her father, who did to her as he had vowed; and she had no relations with a man. It became a custom in Israel, 
JDG.11.40	that the daughters of Israel went yearly to tell the story of the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year.
JDG.12.1	The men of [the tribe of] Ephraim were summoned [to action], and they crossed over to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, “Why did you cross over to fight with the Ammonites without calling us to go with you? [For that] we will burn your house down upon you.” 
JDG.12.2	And Jephthah said to them, “My people and I were in a major conflict with the Ammonites, and when I called you [for help], you did not rescue me from their hand. 
JDG.12.3	So when I saw that you were not coming to help me, I took my life in my hands and crossed over against the Ammonites, and the L
JDG.12.4	Then Jephthah assembled all the men of Gilead and fought with [the tribe of] Ephraim; and the men of Gilead defeated Ephraim, because they had said, “You Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim, in the midst of [the tribes of] Ephraim and Manasseh.” 
JDG.12.5	And the Gileadites took the 
JDG.12.6	they said to him, “Then say ‘Shibboleth.’ ” And he said, “Sibboleth,” for he could not 
JDG.12.7	Jephthah judged Israel for six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in 
JDG.12.8	And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. 
JDG.12.9	He had thirty sons, and thirty daughters whom he gave in marriage outside 
JDG.12.10	Then Ibzan died and was buried at Bethlehem.
JDG.12.11	After him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged Israel for ten years. 
JDG.12.12	Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
JDG.12.13	Now after him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel. 
JDG.12.14	He had forty sons and thirty grandsons who rode on seventy donkeys; and he judged Israel for eight years. 
JDG.12.15	Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried at Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
JDG.13.1	Now Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the L
JDG.13.2	And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was infertile and had no

JDG.13.5	For behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a son. No razor shall come upon his head, for the boy shall be a 
JDG.13.6	Then the woman went and told her husband, saying, “A Man of God came to me and his appearance was like the appearance of the Angel of God, very awesome. I did not ask Him where he came from, and he did not tell me his name. 
JDG.13.7	But He said to me, ‘Behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a son, and now you shall not drink wine or [any other] intoxicating drink, nor eat anything [ceremonially] unclean, for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from birth to the day of his death.’ ”
JDG.13.8	Then Manoah pleaded with the L
JDG.13.9	And God listened to the voice of Manoah; and the Angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field, but Manoah her husband was not with her. 
JDG.13.10	So the woman ran quickly and told her husband, “Behold, the Man who came to me the other day has appeared to me.” 
JDG.13.11	Then Manoah got up and followed his wife, and came to the Man and said to him, “Are you the Man who spoke to this woman?” He said, “I am.” 
JDG.13.12	And Manoah said, “Now when your words come 
JDG.13.13	The Angel of the L
JDG.13.14	She may not eat anything that comes from the vine nor drink wine or [any other] intoxicating drink, nor eat anything [ceremonially] unclean. She shall observe everything that I commanded her.”
JDG.13.15	Then Manoah said to the Angel of the L
JDG.13.16	The Angel of the L
JDG.13.17	Manoah said to the Angel of the L
JDG.13.18	But the Angel of the L
JDG.13.19	So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering and offered it on the rock to the L

JDG.13.21	The Angel of the L
JDG.13.22	So Manoah said to his wife, “We will certainly die, because we have seen God.” 
JDG.13.23	But his [sensible] wife said to him, “If the L
JDG.13.24	So the woman [in due time] gave birth to a son and named him Samson; and the boy grew and the L
JDG.13.25	And the Spirit of the L
JDG.14.1	Samson went down to Timnah and at Timnah he saw a woman, one of the daughters of the Philistines. 
JDG.14.2	So he went back and told his father and his mother, “I saw a woman in Timnah, one of the daughters of the Philistines; now get her for me as a wife.” 
JDG.14.3	But his father and mother said to him, “Is there no woman among the daughters of your relatives, or among all our people, that you must go to take a wife from the uncircumcised (pagan) Philistines?” And Samson said to his father, “Get her for me, because she 
JDG.14.4	His father and mother did not know that it was of the L
JDG.14.5	Then Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother [to arrange the marriage], and they came as far as the vineyards of Timnah; and 
JDG.14.6	The Spirit of the L
JDG.14.7	So he went down and talked with the woman; and she looked pleasing to Samson. 
JDG.14.8	When he returned later to take her, he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion; and behold, a swarm of bees and honey were in the body of the lion. 
JDG.14.9	So he scraped the honey out into his hands and went on, eating as he went. When he came to his father and mother, he gave them 
JDG.14.10	His father went down to the woman, and Samson prepared a feast there, for that was the customary thing for young men to do. 
JDG.14.11	When the people saw him, they brought thirty companions (wedding attendants) to be with him.
JDG.14.12	Then Samson said to them, “Let me now ask you a riddle; if you can tell me what it is within the seven days of the feast, and solve it, then I will give you thirty linen tunics (undergarments) and thirty changes of [outer] clothing. 
JDG.14.13	But if you are unable to tell me [the answer], then you shall give me thirty linen tunics (undergarments) and thirty changes of [outer] clothing.” And they said to him, “Ask your riddle, so that we may hear it.” 
JDG.14.14	So he said to them,
JDG.14.14	“Out of the eater came something to eat,
JDG.14.14	And out of the strong came something sweet.”
JDG.14.14	And they could not solve the riddle in three days.
JDG.14.15	Then on the fourth day they said to Samson’s wife, “Persuade your husband to tell us [through you] the [answer to the] riddle, or we will burn you and your father’s household with fire. Have you invited us to make us poor? Is this not 
JDG.14.16	So Samson’s wife wept before him and said, “You only hate me, you do not love me; you have asked my countrymen a riddle, and have not told [the answer] to me.” And he said to her, “Listen, I have not told my father or my mother [either], so [why] should I tell you?” 
JDG.14.17	However Samson’s wife wept before him seven days while their [wedding] feast lasted, and on the seventh day he told her because she pressed him so hard. Then she told the [answer to the] riddle to her countrymen. 
JDG.14.18	So the men of the city said to Samson on the seventh day before sundown,
JDG.14.18	“What is sweeter than honey?
JDG.14.18	What is stronger than a lion?”
JDG.14.18	And he said to them,
JDG.14.18	“If you had not plowed with 
JDG.14.18	You would not have solved my riddle.”
JDG.14.19	Then the Spirit of the L
JDG.14.20	But Samson’s wife was 
JDG.15.1	But after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife with a young goat [as a gift of reconciliation]; and he said, “I will go in to my wife in 
JDG.15.2	Her father said, “I really thought you utterly hated her; so I gave her to your companion. Is her younger sister not more beautiful than she? Please take her [as your wife] instead.” 
JDG.15.3	Samson said to them, “This time I shall be blameless in regard to the Philistines when I do them harm.” 
JDG.15.4	So Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches and turning 
JDG.15.5	When he had set the torches ablaze, he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and he burned up the heap of sheaves and the standing grain, along with the vineyards and olive groves. 
JDG.15.6	Then the Philistines said, “Who did this?” And they were told, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he took Samson’s wife and gave her to his [chief] companion [at the wedding feast].” So the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire. 
JDG.15.7	Samson said to them, “If this is the way you act, be certain that I will take revenge on you, and [only] after that I will stop.” 
JDG.15.8	Then he struck them 
JDG.15.9	Then the [army of the] Philistines came up and camped in [the tribal territory of] Judah, and overran Lehi (Jawbone). 
JDG.15.10	The men of Judah said, “Why have you come up against us?” And they answered, “We have come up to bind Samson, in order to do to him as he has done to us.” 
JDG.15.11	Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam and said to Samson, “Have you not known that the Philistines are rulers over us? What is this that you have done to us?” He said to them, “As they did to me, so I have done to them.” 
JDG.15.12	They said to him, “We have come down to bind you, so that we may hand you over to the Philistines.” And Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you will not 
JDG.15.13	So they said to him, “No, we will [only] bind you securely and place you into their hands; but we certainly will not kill you.” So they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock [of Etam].
JDG.15.14	When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him. And the Spirit of the L
JDG.15.15	He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, so he reached out his hand and took it and killed a thousand men with it. 
JDG.15.16	Then Samson said,
JDG.15.16	“With the jawbone of a donkey,
JDG.15.16	Heaps upon heaps,
JDG.15.16	With the jawbone of a donkey
JDG.15.16	I have struck down a thousand men.”
JDG.15.17	When he finished speaking, he threw the jawbone from his hand; and he named that place Ramath-lehi (hill of the jawbone). 
JDG.15.18	Then Samson was very thirsty, and he called out to the L
JDG.15.19	So God split open the hollow place that was at Lehi, and water came out of it. When Samson drank, his spirit (strength) returned and he was revived. Therefore he named it En-hakkore (spring which is calling), which is at Lehi to this day. 
JDG.15.20	And Samson judged Israel in the days of [occupation by] the Philistines for twenty years.
JDG.16.1	Then Samson went to Gaza and saw a prostitute there, and went in to her. 
JDG.16.2	The Gazites 
JDG.16.3	But Samson lay [resting] until midnight, then at midnight he got up and took hold of the doors of the city gate and the two door-posts, and pulled them up, [security] bar and all, and he put them on his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the hill which is opposite Hebron.
JDG.16.4	After this he fell in love with a [Philistine] woman [living] in the Valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. 
JDG.16.5	So the [five] lords (governors) of the Philistines came to her and said to her, “Persuade him, and see where his great strength 
JDG.16.6	So Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me where your great strength lies and with what you may be bound and subdued.” 
JDG.16.7	Samson said to her, “If they bind me with seven fresh cords (
JDG.16.8	Then the Philistine lords brought her seven fresh cords that had not been dried, and she bound him with them. 
JDG.16.9	Now she had men lying in ambush in an inner room. And she said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” And he broke the cords as a 
JDG.16.10	Then Delilah said to Samson, “See now, you have mocked me and told me lies; now please tell me [truthfully] how you may be bound.” 
JDG.16.11	He said to her, “If they bind me tightly with new ropes that have not been used, then I will become weak and be like any [other] man.” 
JDG.16.12	So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” And the men lying in ambush were in the inner room. But he snapped the ropes off his arms like [sewing] thread.
JDG.16.13	Then Delilah said to Samson, “Until now you have mocked me and told me lies; tell me [truthfully] with what you may be bound.” And he said to her, “If you weave the seven braids of my hair with the web 
JDG.16.14	So while he slept, Delilah took the seven locks (braids) of his hair and wove them into the web
JDG.16.15	Then she said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times and have not told me where your great strength lies.” 
JDG.16.16	When she pressured him day after day with her words and pleaded with him, he was annoyed to death. 
JDG.16.17	Then [finally] he told her everything that was in his heart and said to her, “A razor has never been used on my head, for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother’s womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will leave me, and I will become weak and be like any [other] man.”
JDG.16.18	Then Delilah realized that he had told her everything in his heart, so she sent and called for the Philistine lords, saying, “Come up this once, because he has told me everything in his heart.” Then the Philistine lords came up to her and brought the money [they had promised] in their hands. 
JDG.16.19	She made Samson sleep on her knees, and she called a man and had him shave off the seven braids of his head. Then she began to abuse Samson, and his strength left him. 
JDG.16.20	She said, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” And he awoke from his sleep and said, “I will go out as I have time after time and shake myself free.” For Samson did not know that the L
JDG.16.21	Then the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza and bound him with [two] bronze chains; and he was 
JDG.16.22	But the hair of his head began to grow again after it had been shaved off.
JDG.16.23	Now the Philistine lords gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to celebrate, for they said,
JDG.16.23	“Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hands!”
JDG.16.24	When the people saw Samson, they praised their god, for they said,
JDG.16.24	“Our god has handed over our enemy to us,
JDG.16.24	The ravager of our country,
JDG.16.24	Who has killed many of us.”
JDG.16.25	Now when they were in high spirits, they said, “Call for Samson, so that he may amuse us.” So they called Samson out of the prison, and he entertained them. They made him stand between the pillars. 
JDG.16.26	Then Samson said to the boy who held him by the hand, “Let me feel the pillars on which the [roof of the] house rests, so that I may lean against them.” 
JDG.16.27	Now the house was full of men and women; all the Philistine lords were there, and on the flat roof were about three thousand men and women who looked on while Samson was entertaining them.
JDG.16.28	Then Samson called to the L
JDG.16.29	Samson took hold of the two middle [support] pillars on which the house rested, and braced himself against them, one with his right hand and the other with his left. 
JDG.16.30	And Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” And he stretched out with all his might [collapsing the support pillars], and the house fell on the lords and on all the people who were in it. So the dead whom he killed at his death were more than those whom he had killed during his life. 
JDG.16.31	Then his brothers and his father’s entire [tribal] household came down, took him, and brought him up; and they buried him in the tomb of Manoah his father, [which was] between Zorah and Eshtaol. So Samson had judged Israel for twenty years.
JDG.17.1	There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Micah. 
JDG.17.2	And he said to his mother, “The eleven hundred 
JDG.17.3	He returned the eleven hundred 
JDG.17.4	So when he returned the silver to his mother, she took two hundred 
JDG.17.5	Now the man Micah had a house of gods (shrine), and he made an ephod and teraphim and dedicated 
JDG.17.6	In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.
JDG.17.7	Now there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, from the family [of the tribe] of Judah, who was a 
JDG.17.8	Then the man left the town of Bethlehem in Judah, to stay wherever he could find 
JDG.17.9	Micah said to him, “Where do you come from?” And he said to him, “I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to stay wherever I can find 
JDG.17.10	And Micah said to him, “Live here with me and be a father and a [personal] priest to me, and I will give you ten 
JDG.17.11	The Levite agreed to live with the man, and the young man became to Micah like one of his sons. 
JDG.17.12	So Micah dedicated (installed) the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in the house of Micah. 
JDG.17.13	Then Micah said, “Now I know that the L
JDG.18.1	In those days there was no king in Israel; and in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking an inheritance [of land] for themselves to live in, for until then an 
JDG.18.2	So the sons of Dan sent from the total number of their [extended] family five brave men from Zorah and Eshtaol, to scout the land and to explore it; and they said to them, “Go, explore the land.” They came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there. 
JDG.18.3	When they passed near Micah’s house, they recognized the voice of the young man, the Levite, and they turned aside there and said to him, “Who brought you here? And what are you doing in this place? And what do you have here?” 
JDG.18.4	And he said to them, “Micah has done this and that for me, and he has hired me and I have become his priest.” 
JDG.18.5	And they said to him, “Please ask of God, so that we may know whether our journey on which we are going will be successful.” 
JDG.18.6	The priest said to them, “Go in peace; the journey on which you are going is acceptable to the L
JDG.18.7	Then the five men went on and came to Laish and saw the people who were there, [how they were] living securely in the style of the Sidonians, quiet and peaceful; and there was no oppressive magistrate in the land humiliating 
JDG.18.8	The five men came back [home] to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol, and their brothers said to them, “What 
JDG.18.9	They said, “Arise, let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good (fertile). Will you sit still 
JDG.18.10	When you enter, you will come to people [feeling] safe and secure with a spacious land [widely extended on all sides]; for God has given it into your hands—a place where there is no lack of anything that is on the earth.”
JDG.18.11	Then from the [tribal] family of the Danites, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, six hundred men armed with weapons of war set out. 
JDG.18.12	They went up and camped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. Therefore they have called that place 
JDG.18.13	They went on from there to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah’s house.
JDG.18.14	Then the five men who had gone to scout the country of Laish said to their relatives, “Do you know that there are in these houses an ephod, teraphim, an image [of silver-plated wood], and a cast image [of solid silver]? Now therefore, consider what you should do.” 
JDG.18.15	So they turned in that direction and came to the house of the young Levite, at the home of Micah, and asked him how he was doing. 
JDG.18.16	Now the six hundred men armed with their weapons of war, who were of the sons of Dan, stood at the entrance of the gate. 
JDG.18.17	Now the five men who had gone to scout the land went up and entered the house and took the image [of silver-plated wood], the ephod, the teraphim, and the cast image [of solid silver], while the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war. 
JDG.18.18	When these [five men] went into Micah’s house and took the [plated] image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the cast image, the priest asked them, “What are you doing?” 
JDG.18.19	They said to him, “Keep quiet, put your hand over your mouth and come with us, and be a father and a priest to us. Is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man, or to be a priest to a tribe and family in Israel?” 
JDG.18.20	The priest’s heart was glad [to hear that], and he took the ephod, the teraphim, and the image, and went among the people.
JDG.18.21	So they turned and left, and they put the children, the livestock, and the valuables 
JDG.18.22	When they had gone some distance from the house of Micah, the men who were [living] in the houses near Micah’s house assembled [as a militia] and overtook the sons of Dan. 
JDG.18.23	They shouted to the Danites, who turned and said to Micah, “What is your 
JDG.18.24	He said, “You have taken away my gods which I have made, and the priest, and have gone away; what else do I have left? How can you say to me, ‘What is your 
JDG.18.25	The sons of Dan said to him, “Do not let your voice [of complaint] be heard among us, or else angry men will assault you and you will lose your life, along with the lives of [everyone in] your household.” 
JDG.18.26	Then the Danites went on their way; and Micah saw that they were too strong for him, so he turned and went back to his house.
JDG.18.27	They took the [idolatrous] things that Micah had made, and his priest, and they came to Laish, to a people who were quiet and secure; and they struck them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire. 
JDG.18.28	And there was no one to rescue them because it was far from Sidon and they had no dealings with anyone. It was in the valley which belongs to Beth-rehob. And they rebuilt the city and lived in it. 
JDG.18.29	They named the city Dan, after Dan their forefather who was born to Israel (Jacob); however, the original name of the city was Laish. 
JDG.18.30	The [tribe of] the sons of Dan set up the image [of silver-plated wood] for themselves; and Jonathan the son of Gershom, the son of 
JDG.18.31	So they set up for themselves Micah’s [silver-plated wooden] image which he had made, 
JDG.19.1	Now it happened in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that a certain Levite living [as an alien] in the most remote part of the hill country of Ephraim, who took a 
JDG.19.2	But his concubine was unfaithful to him, and left him and went to her father’s house in Bethlehem of Judah, and stayed there for a period of four months. 
JDG.19.3	Then her husband arose and went after her to speak kindly 
JDG.19.4	So his father-in-law, the girl’s father, detained him; and he stayed there with him for three days. So they ate and drank, and he lodged there. 
JDG.19.5	On the fourth day they got up early in the morning, and the Levite prepared to leave; but the girl’s father said to his son-in-law, “Strengthen yourself with a piece of bread, and afterward go your way.” 
JDG.19.6	So both men sat down and ate and drank together; and the girl’s father said to the man, “Please be willing to spend the night and enjoy yourself.” 
JDG.19.7	Then the man got up to leave, but his father-in-law urged him [strongly to remain]; so he spent the night there again. 
JDG.19.8	On the fifth day he got up early in the morning to leave, but the girl’s father said, “Please strengthen yourself, and wait until the end of the day.” So both of them ate. 
JDG.19.9	When the man and his concubine and his servant got up to leave, his father-in-law, the girl’s father, said to him, “Behold, now the day has drawn to a close; please spend the night. Look, now the day comes to an end; spend the night here and celebrate, enjoy yourself. Then tomorrow you may get up early for your journey and go 
JDG.19.10	But the man was not willing to stay the night; so he got up and left and came to 
JDG.19.11	When they were near Jebus, the day was almost gone, and the servant said to his master, “Please come and let us turn aside into this Jebusite city and spend the night in it.” 
JDG.19.12	But his master said to him, “We will not turn aside into a city of foreigners who are not of the sons (descendants) of Israel. We will go on as far as Gibeah.” 
JDG.19.13	And he said to his servant, “Come and let us approach one of 
JDG.19.14	So they passed by and went on their way, and the sun set on them near Gibeah, which belongs to [the tribe of] Benjamin, 
JDG.19.15	and they turned aside there to go in and spend the night in Gibeah. And the Levite went in and sat down in the open square of the city, because no man invited them into his house to spend the night.
JDG.19.16	Then behold, 
JDG.19.17	When he looked up, he saw the traveler [and his companions] in the city square; and the old man said, “Where are you going, and where do you come from?” 
JDG.19.18	The Levite replied, “We are passing through from Bethlehem [in the territory] of Judah to the most remote part of the hill country of Ephraim; I am from there. I went to Bethlehem of Judah, but I am 
JDG.19.19	Yet we have both straw and feed for our donkeys, and also bread and wine for me, and for 
JDG.19.20	Then the old man said, “Peace be to you. Only 
JDG.19.21	So he brought him into his house and fed the donkeys; and they washed their feet and ate and drank.
JDG.19.22	While they were 
JDG.19.23	Then the man, the master of the house, went out and said to them, “No, my fellow citizens, please do not act so wickedly. Since this man has come to my house [as my guest], do not commit this sacrilege. 
JDG.19.24	Here is my virgin daughter and this man’s concubine. I will bring them out now; abuse 
JDG.19.25	But the men would not listen to him. So the man took the Levite’s concubine and brought her outside to them; and they had relations with her and abused her all night until morning; and when daybreak came, they let her go. 
JDG.19.26	At daybreak the woman came and collapsed at the door of the man’s house where her master was, until it was [fully] light.
JDG.19.27	When her master got up in the morning and opened the doors of the house and went out to go on his way, he saw his concubine lying at the door of the house, and her hands were on the threshold. 
JDG.19.28	He said to her, “Get up, and let us go.” But there was no answer [for she had died]. Then he put her [body] on the donkey; and the man left and went home. 
JDG.19.29	When he arrived at his house, he took a knife, and taking hold of his [dead] concubine, he cut her [corpse] limb by limb into twelve pieces, and sent her [body parts] throughout all the territory of Israel. 
JDG.19.30	All who saw 
JDG.20.1	Then all the sons of Israel from Dan [in the north] to Beersheba [in the south], including the land of Gilead came out, and the congregation assembled as one man to the L
JDG.20.2	The chiefs of all the people of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand men on foot who drew the sword. 
JDG.20.3	(Now the Benjamites [in whose territory the crime was committed] heard that the [other tribes of the] sons of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) And the sons of Israel said, “How did this evil thing happen?” 
JDG.20.4	So the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, replied, “I had come with my concubine to spend the night in Gibeah, [a town] which belongs to [the tribe of] Benjamin. 
JDG.20.5	But the men of Gibeah rose up against me and surrounded the house at night because of me. They intended to kill me, but instead they raped my concubine [so brutally] that she died. 
JDG.20.6	So I took my concubine and cut her [corpse] in pieces and sent her [body parts] throughout the land of the inheritance of Israel; for the men of Gibeah have committed a lewd and disgraceful act in Israel. 
JDG.20.7	Now then, all you sons of Israel, all of you, give your advice and counsel here [regarding what should be done].”
JDG.20.8	Then all the people stood [unified] as one man, saying, “None of us will go to his tent, and none of us will return to his home [until this is settled]. 
JDG.20.9	But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah; 
JDG.20.10	and we will take ten men out of a hundred throughout the tribes of Israel, and a hundred out of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand to bring provisions for the men, so that when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, they may punish them for all the despicable acts which they have committed in Israel.” 
JDG.20.11	So all the men of Israel assembled against the city, united as one man.
JDG.20.12	Then the tribes of Israel sent men through the entire tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What is this evil thing that has been done among you? 
JDG.20.13	Now therefore, turn over the men [involved], the 
JDG.20.14	Then the [tribe of the] sons of Benjamin gathered from the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the [other] sons of Israel. 
JDG.20.15	And the Benjamites assembled out of their cities at that time twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who assembled seven hundred chosen men. 
JDG.20.16	Out of all these people were seven hundred choice 
JDG.20.17	Then the men of Israel, other than Benjamin, assembled four hundred thousand men who drew the sword; all of these were men of war.
JDG.20.18	The men of Israel arose and went up to 
JDG.20.19	Then the [fighting men of the] sons of Israel arose in the morning and camped against Gibeah. 
JDG.20.20	The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin, and assembled in battle formation against them at Gibeah. 
JDG.20.21	The sons of Benjamin came out of Gibeah and struck to the ground on that day twenty-two thousand [fighting] men of Israel. 
JDG.20.22	But the people, the [fighting] men of Israel, took courage 
JDG.20.23	The sons of Israel went up and wept before the L
JDG.20.24	So the sons of Israel came against the sons of Benjamin the second day. 
JDG.20.25	And [the fighting men from the tribe of] Benjamin went out of Gibeah against them the second day and again struck to the ground the sons of Israel, eighteen thousand men, all of whom were swordsmen. 
JDG.20.26	Then all the sons of Israel and all the people went up and came to Bethel and wept; and they sat there before the L
JDG.20.27	And the sons of Israel inquired of the L
JDG.20.28	and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, 
JDG.20.29	So Israel set men in ambush around Gibeah. 
JDG.20.30	The [fighting men of the] sons of Israel went up against the sons of Benjamin on the third day and placed themselves in battle formation against Gibeah as at other times. 
JDG.20.31	The Benjamites went out against 
JDG.20.32	And the Benjamites said, “They are defeated before us, as at the first.” But the sons of Israel said, “Let us flee and lure them away from the city to the highways.” 
JDG.20.33	Then all the men of Israel got up from their places and placed themselves in battle formation at Baal-tamar; and the men of Israel [who were] in ambush rushed from their place in the plain of Maareh-geba. 
JDG.20.34	When the ten thousand choice [fighting] men from all Israel came against Gibeah, the battle was hard 
JDG.20.35	And the L
JDG.20.36	So the Benjamites realized that they were defeated. Then men of Israel gave ground to the Benjamites, because they relied on the men in ambush whom they had placed against Gibeah. 
JDG.20.37	Then the men in ambush quickly rushed and attacked Gibeah; and the men in ambush also deployed and struck the entire city with the edge of the sword. 
JDG.20.38	Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in ambush was that they would make a great cloud of smoke rise from the city. 
JDG.20.39	So the men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike and kill about thirty men of Israel, for they said, “Certainly they are defeated before us as in the first battle!” 
JDG.20.40	But when the [signal] cloud began to rise out of the city in a column of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them; and behold, the entire city went up 
JDG.20.41	When the men of Israel turned back 
JDG.20.42	Therefore, they turned their backs before the men of Israel [and fled] toward the direction of the wilderness, but the battle followed 
JDG.20.43	They surrounded [the men of] Benjamin, pursued them relentlessly, and overtook them opposite Gibeah toward the east. 
JDG.20.44	Thus eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell, all of these brave 
JDG.20.45	The survivors [of Benjamin] turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and Israel caught five thousand of them on the roads and overtook them at Gidom and killed two thousand of them. 
JDG.20.46	So all of Benjamin who fell that day were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword, all of them brave 
JDG.20.47	But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon and stayed at the rock of Rimmon for four months. 
JDG.20.48	The men of Israel turned back against [the tribe of] the sons of Benjamin and struck them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city [of Gibeah] and the livestock and all that they found. They also set on fire all the [surrounding] towns which they found.
JDG.21.1	Now the men of Israel had sworn [an oath] at Mizpah, “None of us shall give his daughter in marriage to [a man of] Benjamin.” 
JDG.21.2	So the people came to Bethel and sat there before God until evening, and lifted up their voices and wept bitterly. 
JDG.21.3	They said, “O L
JDG.21.4	And the next day the people got up early and built an altar there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
JDG.21.5	Then the sons of Israel said, “Which one from all the tribes of Israel did not come up in the assembly to the L
JDG.21.6	And the sons of Israel felt sorry [and had compassion] for their brother Benjamin and said, “One tribe has been cut off from Israel today. 
JDG.21.7	What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since we have sworn [an oath] by the L
JDG.21.8	And they said, “Which one is there of the tribes from Israel that did not come up to Mizpah to the L
JDG.21.9	For when the people were assembled, behold, there was not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there. 
JDG.21.10	And the congregation sent twelve thousand of the most courageous men there, and commanded them saying, “Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the sword, including the women and the children. 
JDG.21.11	And this is the thing that you shall do; you shall utterly destroy every male and every woman who 
JDG.21.12	And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known a man intimately; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
JDG.21.13	Then the whole congregation sent 
JDG.21.14	So [the survivors of] Benjamin returned at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had kept alive from the women of Jabesh-gilead; but there were not enough [to provide wives] for them. 
JDG.21.15	And the people were sorry [and had compassion] for [the survivors of the tribe of] Benjamin because the L
JDG.21.16	Then the elders of the congregation said, “What shall we do for wives for those [men] who are left, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?” 
JDG.21.17	They said, “
JDG.21.18	But we cannot give them wives from our daughters.” For the sons of Israel had sworn [an oath], “Cursed is he who gives a wife to [a man from the tribe of] Benjamin.”
JDG.21.19	So they said, “Listen, there is the yearly feast of the L
JDG.21.20	So they instructed the sons of Benjamin, saying, “Go, set an ambush in the vineyards, 
JDG.21.21	and watch; if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then you shall come out of the vineyards and each of you shall catch his wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of [the tribe of] Benjamin. 
JDG.21.22	When their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, we shall say to them, ‘Give them to us voluntarily, because we did not take a wife for each man 
JDG.21.23	So the sons of [the tribe of] Benjamin did as instructed and took wives according to their number, from the dancers whom they carried away. Then they went and returned to their inheritance, and rebuilt the towns and lived in them. 
JDG.21.24	The sons of Israel departed from there at that time, each man to his tribe and family, and each man went from there to his inheritance.
JDG.21.25	In those days [when the judges governed] there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.
RUT.1.1	In the days when the judges governed [Israel], there was a famine in the land [of Canaan]. And a certain man of Bethlehem in Judah went to live temporarily in the 
RUT.1.2	The man’s name was Elimelech and his wife’s name was Naomi and his two sons were named Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They went to the country of Moab and stayed there. 
RUT.1.3	Then Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died, and she was left [a widow] with her two sons. 
RUT.1.4	They took wives from the Moabite women; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other was Ruth. They lived there about ten years; 
RUT.1.5	and then both Mahlon and Chilion also died, so the woman [Naomi] was left without her two sons and her husband.
RUT.1.6	Then she set out with her daughters-in-law to return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in Moab how the L
RUT.1.7	So she left the place where she was living, her two daughters-in-law with her, and they started on the way back to the land of Judah. 
RUT.1.8	But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go back, each of you return to your mother’s house. May the L
RUT.1.9	May the L
RUT.1.10	And they said to her, “No, we will go with you to your people [in Judah].” 
RUT.1.11	But Naomi said, “Go back, my daughters, why should you go with me? Do I still have sons in my womb that may become your husbands? 
RUT.1.12	Go back, my daughters, go, for I am too old to have a husband. If I said I have hope, and if I actually had a husband tonight and even gave birth to sons, 
RUT.1.13	would you wait until they were grown? Would you go without marrying? No, my daughters; for it is much more 
RUT.1.14	Then they wept aloud again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law [goodbye], but Ruth clung to her.
RUT.1.15	Then Naomi said, “Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; turn back 
RUT.1.16	But Ruth said, “Do not urge me to leave you or to turn back from following you; for where you go, I will go, and where you lodge, I will lodge. Your people will be my people, and your God, my God. 
RUT.1.17	Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May the L
RUT.1.18	When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she said nothing more.
RUT.1.19	So the two of them went on until they came to Bethlehem. And when they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole city was 
RUT.1.20	She said to them, “Do not call me Naomi (sweetness); call me Mara (bitter), for the Almighty has caused me great grief 
RUT.1.21	I left full [with a husband and two sons], but the L
RUT.1.22	So Naomi returned from the country of Moab, and with her Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law. And they arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.
RUT.2.1	Now Naomi had a relative of her husband, a man of great wealth 
RUT.2.2	And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Please let me go to the field and 
RUT.2.3	So Ruth went and picked up the leftover grain in a field after the reapers; and she happened to stop at the plot of land belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. 
RUT.2.4	It was then that Boaz came back from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, “The L
RUT.2.5	Then Boaz said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers, “Whose young woman is this?” 
RUT.2.6	The servant in charge of the reapers answered, “She is the young Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab. 
RUT.2.7	And she said, ‘Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the 
RUT.2.8	Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen carefully, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field or leave this one, but stay here close by my maids. 
RUT.2.9	Watch which field they reap, and follow behind them. I have commanded the servants not to touch you. And when you are thirsty, go to the [water] jars and drink from what the servants draw.” 
RUT.2.10	Then she kneeled face downward, bowing to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your eyes that you should notice me, when I am a foreigner?” 
RUT.2.11	Boaz answered her, “I have been made fully aware of everything that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father and mother and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you did not know before. 
RUT.2.12	May the L
RUT.2.13	Then she said, “Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, for you have comforted me and have spoken kindly to your maidservant, though I am not as one of your maidservants.”
RUT.2.14	At mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come over here and eat some bread and dip your bread in the vinegar.” So she sat beside the reapers; and he served her roasted grain, and she ate until she was satisfied and she had some left [for Naomi]. 
RUT.2.15	When she got up to glean, Boaz ordered his servants, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not insult her. 
RUT.2.16	Also you shall purposely pull out for her some stalks [of grain] from the sheaves and leave them so that she may collect them, and do not rebuke her.”
RUT.2.17	So she gleaned in the field until evening. Then she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an 
RUT.2.18	She picked it up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. Ruth also took out and gave to Naomi what she had saved after she [had eaten and] was satisfied. 
RUT.2.19	Her mother-in-law said to her, “Where did you glean today? Where did you work? Blessed be the man who took notice of you.” So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked and said, “The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz.” 
RUT.2.20	Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed of the L
RUT.2.21	Then Ruth the Moabitess said, “He also said to me, ‘Stay close to my servants until they have harvested my entire crop.’ ” 
RUT.2.22	Naomi said to Ruth, “It is good, my daughter, for you to go out [to work] with his maids, so that others do not assault you in another field.” 
RUT.2.23	So she stayed close to the maids of Boaz, gleaning until the end of the barley and wheat harvests. And she lived with her mother-in-law.
RUT.3.1	Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to Ruth, “My daughter, shall I not look for 
RUT.3.2	Now Boaz, with whose maids you were [working], is he not our relative? See now, he is winnowing barley at the threshing floor tonight. 
RUT.3.3	So wash and anoint yourself [with olive oil], then put on your [
RUT.3.4	When he lies down, notice the place where he is lying, and 
RUT.3.5	Ruth answered her, “I will do everything that you say.”
RUT.3.6	So she went down to the threshing floor and did just as her mother-in-law had told her. 
RUT.3.7	When Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was happy, he went to lie down at the end of the stack of grain. Then Ruth came secretly, and uncovered his feet and lay down. 
RUT.3.8	In the middle of the night the man was startled and he turned over, and found a woman lying at his feet. 
RUT.3.9	So he said, “Who are you?” And she answered, “I am Ruth your maid. Spread the hem of your garment over me, for you are a close relative 
RUT.3.10	Then he said, “May you be blessed by the L
RUT.3.11	Now, my daughter, do not be afraid. I will do for you whatever you ask, since all my people in the city know that you are a woman of excellence. 
RUT.3.12	It is true that I am your close relative 
RUT.3.13	Spend the night [here], and in the morning if he will redeem you, fine; let him do it. But if he does not wish to redeem you, then, as the L
RUT.3.14	So she lay at his feet until the morning, but got up before anyone could recognize another; Boaz said, “
RUT.3.15	He also said, “Give me the shawl you are wearing and hold it out.” So Ruth held it and he measured out six measures of barley [into it] and placed it on her. And she went into the city. 
RUT.3.16	When she came home, her mother-in-law said, “How did it go, my daughter?” And Ruth told her everything that the man had done for her. 
RUT.3.17	She said, “He gave me these six measures of barley, and he said to me, ‘Do not go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.’ ” 
RUT.3.18	Then Naomi said, “Sit 
RUT.4.1	Then Boaz went up to the city gate [where business and legal matters were settled] and sat down, and then the close relative (redeemer) of whom Boaz had spoken came by. He said to him, “Come over here, 
RUT.4.2	Then Boaz took ten men from the elders of the city and said, “Sit down here.” And they sat down. 
RUT.4.3	He said to the closest relative (redeemer), “Naomi, who has returned from the country of Moab, must sell the plot of land which belonged to our brother Elimelech. 
RUT.4.4	So I thought to let you hear of it, saying, ‘Buy it in the presence of those sitting here, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if not, then tell me, so that I may know; for there is no one besides you to redeem it, and I am [next of kin] after you.’ ” And he said, “I will redeem it.” 
RUT.4.5	Then Boaz said, “The day that you buy the field from Naomi, you must also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of the deceased, to restore the name of the deceased to his inheritance.” 
RUT.4.6	The closest relative (redeemer) said, “I cannot redeem it for myself, because [by marrying a Moabitess] I would 
RUT.4.7	Now formerly in Israel this was the custom concerning redeeming and exchanging 
RUT.4.8	So, when the closest relative (redeemer) said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself,” he pulled off his sandal [and gave it to Boaz to confirm the agreement]. 
RUT.4.9	Then Boaz said to the elders and to all the people, “You are witnesses this day that I have bought everything that was Elimelech’s and everything that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s from the hand of Naomi. 
RUT.4.10	I have also acquired Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, to be my wife to restore the name of the deceased to his inheritance, so that the name of the deceased will not be cut off from his brothers or from the gate of his birthplace. You are witnesses today.” 
RUT.4.11	All the people at the gate and the elders said, “We are witnesses. May the L
RUT.4.12	Further, may your house be like the house of Perez whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring which the L
RUT.4.13	So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife. And he went in to her, and the L
RUT.4.14	Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed is the L
RUT.4.15	May he also be to you one who restores life and sustains your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.”

RUT.4.17	The neighbor women gave him a name, saying, “A son (grandson) has been born to Naomi.” They named him Obed (worshiper). He is the father of Jesse, the father of David [the ancestor of Jesus Christ].
RUT.4.18	Now these are the descendants of Perez: Perez was the father of Hezron,

1SA.1.3	This man went up from his city

1SA.1.5	But to Hannah he would give a double portion, because he loved Hannah, but the L

1SA.2.14	then he would thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; everything that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is what they did in Shiloh to all [the sacrifices of] the

1SA.2.22	Now Eli was very old; and he heard about everything that his sons were doing to all [the people of] Israel, and how they were lying with the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle). 
1SA.2.23	Eli said to them, “Why do you do such things, the evil things that I hear from all these people? 
1SA.2.24	No, my sons; for the report that I keep hearing from the passers-by among the L
1SA.2.25	If one man does wrong 
1SA.2.26	But the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor both with the L
1SA.2.27	Then a man of God (prophet) came to Eli and said to him, “Thus says the L

1SA.3.1	Now the boy Samuel was attending to the service of the L
1SA.3.2	Yet it happened at that time, as Eli was lying down in his own place (now his eyesight had begun to grow dim and he could not see 
1SA.3.3	and the [oil] lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the L
1SA.3.4	that the L
1SA.3.5	He ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But Eli said, “I did not call you; lie down again.” So he went and lay down. 
1SA.3.6	Then the L
1SA.3.7	Now Samuel did not yet know [or personally experience] the L
1SA.3.8	So the L
1SA.3.9	So Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down, and it shall be that if He calls you, you shall say, ‘Speak, L

1SA.3.14	Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the sinful behavior of Eli’s house (family) shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever.”
1SA.3.15	So Samuel lay down until morning. Then he opened the doors of the L
1SA.3.16	But Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son.” And he answered, “Here I am.” 
1SA.3.17	Then Eli said, “What is it that He said to you? Please do not hide it from me. May God do the same to you, and more also, if you hide from me anything of all that He said to you.” 
1SA.3.18	So Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing from him. And Eli said, “It is the L
1SA.3.19	Now Samuel grew; and the L

1SA.4.2	The Philistines assembled in battle formation to meet Israel, and when the battle was over, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men on the battlefield. 
1SA.4.3	When the people (soldiers) came into the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has the L
1SA.4.4	So the people sent 
1SA.4.5	So it happened that as the ark of the covenant of the L
1SA.4.6	When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, “What 
1SA.4.7	The Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come into the camp.” And they said, “Woe [disaster is coming] to us! For nothing like this has happened before. 
1SA.4.8	Woe to us! Who will rescue us from the hand of these mighty 
1SA.4.9	Take courage, and be men, O Philistines, so that you do not become servants to the Hebrews, as they have been servants to you; act like men and fight!”
1SA.4.10	So the Philistines fought; Israel was defeated and every man fled to his tent. It was a very great defeat, for thirty thousand foot soldiers of Israel fell. 
1SA.4.11	Also the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were killed.
1SA.4.12	Now a man [from the tribe] of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh that same day with his clothes torn and dust on his head [as signs of mourning over the disaster]. 
1SA.4.13	When he arrived, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road, keeping watch, because his heart was anxious about the ark of God. When the man arrived to report [the news] in the city, everyone in the city cried out [to God, for help]. 
1SA.4.14	When Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he asked, “What is the noise of this uproar?” And the man came hurriedly and told Eli. 
1SA.4.15	Now Eli was ninety-eight years old; his eyes were dim so that he could not see. 
1SA.4.16	The man said to Eli, “I have come from the battle line. Indeed, I escaped from the battle line today.” Eli said, “How did things go, my son?” 
1SA.4.17	The messenger replied, “Israel has fled before the Philistines and there has also been a great slaughter among the people. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been taken.” 
1SA.4.18	When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell off the seat backwards by the side of the [city] gate. His neck was broken and he died, for he was old and heavy. He had judged Israel for forty years.
1SA.4.19	Now his daughter-in-law, Phinehas’ wife, was pregnant, and was about to give birth; so when she heard the news that the ark of God had been taken and that her father-in-law and her husband had died, she kneeled down and gave birth, because her [labor] pains began. 
1SA.4.20	And about the time of her death [following the sudden birth] the women attending her said to her, “Do not be afraid, for you have given birth to a son.” But she did not answer or pay any attention. 
1SA.4.21	And she named the boy 
1SA.4.22	She said, “The glory has left Israel, for the ark of God has been taken.”
1SA.5.1	Then the Philistines took the ark of God, and they brought it from Ebenezer to 
1SA.5.2	They took the ark of God and brought it into the house of Dagon and set it beside [the image of] Dagon [their chief idol]. 
1SA.5.3	When the people of Ashdod got up early the next day, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the L
1SA.5.4	But when they got up early the next morning, behold, Dagon had [again] fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the L
1SA.5.5	This is the reason neither the priests of Dagon nor any who enter Dagon’s house step on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.
1SA.5.6	Then the hand of the L
1SA.5.7	When the men of Ashdod saw what had happened, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for His hand is heavy on us and on Dagon our god.” 
1SA.5.8	So they sent 
1SA.5.9	But it happened that after they had taken it 
1SA.5.10	So they sent the ark of God to 
1SA.5.11	So they sent 
1SA.5.12	The men who had not died were stricken with tumors and the cry of the city [for help] went up to heaven.
1SA.6.1	Now the ark of the L
1SA.6.2	And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners (seers), saying, “What shall we do with the ark of the L
1SA.6.3	They said, “If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty [without a gift]; but be sure to return [it] to Him [together with] a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why His hand is not removed from you.” 
1SA.6.4	Then they said, “What shall the guilt offering be which we shall return to Him?” They answered, “
1SA.6.5	So you shall make replicas of your tumors and of your mice that ravage the land, and give glory to the God of Israel; perhaps He will lighten His hand [of judgment] on you and your gods and your land. 
1SA.6.6	Why then do you harden your hearts [allowing pride to cause your downfall] just as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He had severely dealt with them 
1SA.6.7	Now then, make a new cart and prepare two 
1SA.6.8	Then take the ark of the L
1SA.6.9	But watch, 
1SA.6.10	And the men did so, and took two milk cows and hitched them to the cart, and corralled their calves at home. 
1SA.6.11	They put the ark of the L
1SA.6.12	And the cows went straight toward Beth-shemesh along the highway, lowing as they went, and did not turn away to the right or the left. And the Philistine lords (governors) followed them to the border of Beth-shemesh.
1SA.6.13	Now 
1SA.6.14	The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh and stopped there. A large stone was there; and the men split up the wood of the cart [for firewood] and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the L
1SA.6.15	The Levites had taken down the ark of the L
1SA.6.16	When the five lords of the Philistines saw what happened, they returned to Ekron that day.
1SA.6.17	These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to the L
1SA.6.18	also the golden mice, 
1SA.6.19	The L
1SA.6.20	The men of Beth-shemesh said, “Who is able to stand before the L
1SA.6.21	So they sent messengers to the residents of Kiriath-jearim, saying, “The Philistines have returned the ark of the L
1SA.7.1	So the men of Kiriath-jearim came and took up the ark of the Lord and brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and they consecrated Eleazar his son to care for the ark of the Lord. 
1SA.7.2	And from that day the ark remained in Kiriath-jearim for a very long time, for it was twenty years [until the reign of King David]; and all the house of Israel lamented (wailed) 
1SA.7.3	Then Samuel said to all the house of Israel, “If you are returning to the L
1SA.7.4	So the Israelites removed the Baals and the Ashtaroth and served the L
1SA.7.5	Samuel said, “Gather all Israel together at Mizpah and I will pray to the L
1SA.7.6	So they gathered at Mizpah, and drew water and poured it out before the L
1SA.7.7	Now when the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, the lords (governors) of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the Israelites heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines. 
1SA.7.8	And the sons of Israel said to Samuel, “Do not cease to cry out to the L
1SA.7.9	So Samuel took a nursing lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the L
1SA.7.10	As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines approached for the battle against Israel. Then the L
1SA.7.11	And the men of Israel came out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and struck them down as far as [the territory] below Beth-car.
1SA.7.12	Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and he named it Ebenezer (stone of help), saying, “Thus far the L
1SA.7.13	So the Philistines were subdued and they did not come anymore into Israelite territory. And the hand of the L
1SA.7.14	The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath; and Israel recovered the cities’ territory from the Philistines. Also there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
1SA.7.15	Now Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 
1SA.7.16	He used to go annually on a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and he judged Israel in all these places. 
1SA.7.17	Then he would return to Ramah, because his home was there; and there he judged Israel, and there he built an altar to the L
1SA.8.1	And it came about when Samuel was old that he appointed his sons as judges over Israel. 
1SA.8.2	Now the name of his firstborn was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judging in Beersheba. 
1SA.8.3	His sons, however, did not walk in his ways, but turned aside after dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice.
1SA.8.4	Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah 
1SA.8.5	and said to him, “Look, you have grown old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint us a king to judge us [and rule over us] like all the other nations.” 
1SA.8.6	But their demand 
1SA.8.7	The L
1SA.8.8	Like all the deeds which they have done since the day that I brought them up from Egypt even to this day—in that they have abandoned (rejected) Me and served other gods—so they are doing to you also. 
1SA.8.9	So now listen to their voice; only solemnly warn them and tell them the ways of the king who will reign over them.”
1SA.8.10	So Samuel told all the words of the L
1SA.8.11	He said, “These will be the ways of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them for himself to his chariots and among his horsemen and they will run before his chariots. 
1SA.8.12	He will appoint them for himself to be commanders over thousands and over fifties, and 
1SA.8.13	He will take your daughters to be perfumers, cooks, and bakers. 
1SA.8.14	He will take the best of your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, and give them to his servants. 
1SA.8.15	He will take a tenth of your grain and of your vineyards and give it to his officers and to his servants. 
1SA.8.16	He will take your male servants and your female servants and your best young men and your donkeys and use them for his work. 
1SA.8.17	He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves shall be his servants. 
1SA.8.18	Then you will cry out on that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the L
1SA.8.19	Nevertheless, the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel, and they said, “No, but there shall be a king over us, 
1SA.8.20	so that we too may be like all the nations [around us], that our king may judge [and govern] us and go out before us and fight our battles.” 
1SA.8.21	Samuel had heard all the words of the people and repeated them 
1SA.8.22	And the L
1SA.9.1	There was a man of [the tribe of] Benjamin whose name was Kish the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of influence 
1SA.9.2	Kish had a son named Saul, a choice and handsome man; among the sons of Israel there was not a man more handsome than he. From his shoulders and up he was [a head] taller than any of the people.
1SA.9.3	Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, had wandered off 
1SA.9.4	And they passed through the hill country of Ephraim and the land of Shalishah, but did not find 
1SA.9.5	When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, let us return, otherwise my father will stop 
1SA.9.6	The servant said to him, “Look here, in this city there is a man of God, and the man is held in honor; everything that he says comes true. Now let us go there; perhaps he can advise us about our journey [and tell us where we should go].” 
1SA.9.7	Then Saul said to his servant, “But look, if we go [to see him], what shall we bring to the man? For the bread from our sacks is gone and there is no gift to bring to the man of God. What do we have [to offer]?” 
1SA.9.8	The servant replied again to Saul, “Here in my hand I have a quarter of a shekel of silver; I will give that to the man of God, and he will advise us as to [where we should go on] our journey [to find the donkeys].” 
1SA.9.9	(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he would say, “Come, let us go to the seer”; for 
1SA.9.10	Saul said to his servant, “Well said; come, let us go.” So they went to the city where the man of God was living.
1SA.9.11	As they went up the hill to the city, they met some young women going out to draw water, and said to them, “Is the seer (prophet) here?” 
1SA.9.12	They answered them, “He is; look, he is ahead of you. Hurry now, for he has come into the city today because the people have a sacrifice on the high place today. 
1SA.9.13	As you enter the city you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat, for the people will not eat until he comes, because he must ask the blessing on the sacrifice; afterward, those who are invited will eat. So go up now, for about now you will find him.” 
1SA.9.14	So they went up to the city. And as they came into the city, there was Samuel coming out toward them to go up to the high place.
1SA.9.15	Now a day before Saul came, the L
1SA.9.16	“About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him as leader over My people Israel; and he will save My people from the hand of the Philistines. For I have looked upon [the distress of] My people, because their cry [for help] has come to Me.” 
1SA.9.17	When Samuel saw Saul, the L
1SA.9.18	Then Saul approached Samuel in the [city] gate and said, “Please tell me where the seer’s house is.” 
1SA.9.19	Samuel answered Saul, “I am the seer. Go on ahead of me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today; and in the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is on your mind. 
1SA.9.20	As for your donkeys which were lost three days ago, do not be concerned about them, for they have been found. And for whom are all things that are desirable in Israel? Are they not for you and for all your father’s household (family)?” 
1SA.9.21	Saul replied, “Am I not a Benjamite, of 
1SA.9.22	Then Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall [at the high place] and gave them a place [to sit] at the head of the persons—about thirty men—who were invited [while the rest ate outside]. 
1SA.9.23	Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the [priests’] portion that I gave you, regarding which I told you, ‘Set it aside.’ ” 
1SA.9.24	Then the cook lifted up the leg (thigh) with 
1SA.9.25	When they came down from the high place into the city, Samuel spoke with Saul on the

1SA.9.27	As they were going down to the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us so that he may pass by but you stand still now so that I may proclaim the word of God to you.”
1SA.10.1	Then Samuel took the flask of oil and poured it on Saul’s head, kissed him, and said, “Has the L
1SA.10.2	When you leave me today, you will meet two men beside Rachel’s tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah; they will say to you, ‘The donkeys you went to look for have been found. And your father has stopped caring about them and is worried about you, saying, “What shall I do about my son?” ’ 
1SA.10.3	Then you will go on further from there, and you will come to the terebinth tree of Tabor, and three men going up to [sacrifice to] God at Bethel will meet you there, one carrying three young goats, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a jug of wine. 
1SA.10.4	They will greet you and give you two 
1SA.10.5	After that you will come to 
1SA.10.6	Then the Spirit of the L
1SA.10.7	When these signs come to you, do for yourself whatever 
1SA.10.8	You shall go down ahead of me to Gilgal; and behold, I will be coming down to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice peace offerings. You shall wait seven days until I come to you and show you what you must do.”
1SA.10.9	Then it happened when Saul turned his back to leave Samuel, God changed his heart; and all those signs came to pass that day. 
1SA.10.10	When they came to the hill [Gibeah], behold, a group of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came on him mightily, and he prophesied [under divine guidance] among them. 
1SA.10.11	Now when all who knew Saul previously saw that he actually prophesied now [by inspiration] with the prophets, the people said one to another, “What has happened to [Saul, who is nobody but] the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?” 
1SA.10.12	And a man from there answered, “But who is the father of the others?” So it became a proverb, “Is Saul also among the prophets?” 
1SA.10.13	When Saul had finished prophesying, he went to the high place [of worship].
1SA.10.14	Saul’s uncle said to him and to his servant, “Where did you go?” And Saul said, “To look for the donkeys. And when we saw that they were nowhere to be found, we went to Samuel [for help].” 
1SA.10.15	Saul’s uncle said, “Please tell me, what did Samuel say to you?” 
1SA.10.16	And Saul said to his uncle, “He told us plainly that the donkeys had been found.” But he did not tell him about the matter of the kingdom which Samuel had mentioned.
1SA.10.17	Then Samuel called the people together to the L
1SA.10.18	and he said to Israel, “Thus says the L
1SA.10.19	But today you have rejected your God, who Himself saves you from all your disasters and distresses; yet you have said, ‘No! Set a king over us.’ Now then, present yourselves before the L
1SA.10.20	And when Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, the tribe of Benjamin was chosen by lot. 
1SA.10.21	Then he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families, and the family of Matri was chosen by lot. And Saul the son of Kish was chosen by lot; but when they looked for him, he could not be found. 
1SA.10.22	So they inquired further of the L
1SA.10.23	So they ran and took him from there, and when he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward. 
1SA.10.24	Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see him whom the L
1SA.10.25	Then Samuel told the people the 
1SA.10.26	Saul also went home to Gibeah; and the 
1SA.10.27	But some 
1SA.11.1	Now Nahash the 
1SA.11.2	But Nahash the Ammonite told them, “I will make 
1SA.11.3	The elders of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Give us seven days so that we may send messengers throughout the territory of Israel. Then, if there is no one to save us, we will come out [and surrender] to you.” 
1SA.11.4	Then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and told the news to the people; and all the people raised their voices and wept aloud.
1SA.11.5	Now Saul was coming out of the field behind the oxen, and he said, “What is 
1SA.11.6	The Spirit of God came upon Saul mightily when he heard these words, and he became extremely angry. 
1SA.11.7	He took a team of oxen and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, “Whoever does not come out to follow Saul and Samuel, the same shall be done to his oxen.” Then fear of the L
1SA.11.8	He assembled 
1SA.11.9	They said to the messengers who had come, “You shall say to the men of Jabesh-gilead: ‘Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you will have 
1SA.11.10	So the men of Jabesh said [to Nahash the Ammonite], “Tomorrow we will come out to you [to surrender], and you may do to us whatever seems good to you.” 
1SA.11.11	The next morning Saul put the men into three companies; and they entered the [Ammonites’] camp during the [darkness of the early] morning watch and killed the Ammonites until the heat of the day; and the survivors were scattered, and no two of them were left together.
1SA.11.12	The people said to Samuel, “Who is the one who said, ‘Shall Saul reign over us?’ Bring the men, and we will put them to death.” 
1SA.11.13	But Saul said, “No man shall be put to death this day, for today the L
1SA.11.14	Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go to Gilgal and there restore the kingdom.” 
1SA.11.15	So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the L
1SA.12.1	Then Samuel said to all Israel, “Behold, I have listened to your voice in everything that you have said to me and have appointed a king over you. 
1SA.12.2	And now, here is the king walking before you. As for me, I am old and gray, and here are my sons with you. I have walked before you from my childhood to this day. 
1SA.12.3	Here I am; testify against me before the L
1SA.12.4	They said, “You have not exploited us or oppressed us or taken anything at all from a man’s hand.” 
1SA.12.5	Samuel said to them, “The L
1SA.12.6	Then Samuel said to the people, “It is the L
1SA.12.7	Now then, take your stand, so that I may plead 
1SA.12.8	When Jacob [and his sons] had come into Egypt [and later when the Egyptians oppressed them] and your 
1SA.12.9	But when they forgot the L
1SA.12.10	They cried out to the L
1SA.12.11	Then the L
1SA.12.12	But when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites had come against you, you said to me, ‘No, but a king shall reign over us’—although the L
1SA.12.13	Now therefore, here is [Saul] the king whom you have chosen, and for whom you asked; behold, the L
1SA.12.14	If you will fear the L
1SA.12.15	But if you do not listen to the L
1SA.12.16	So now, take your stand and see this great thing which the L
1SA.12.17	Is it not [the beginning of the] wheat harvest today? I will call to the L
1SA.12.18	So Samuel called to the L
1SA.12.19	Then all the people said to Samuel, “Pray to the L
1SA.12.20	Samuel said to the people, “Do not be afraid. You have [indeed] done all this evil; yet do not turn away from following the L
1SA.12.21	You must not turn away, for 
1SA.12.22	The L
1SA.12.23	Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the L
1SA.12.24	Only fear the L
1SA.12.25	But if you still do evil, both you and your king will be swept away [to destruction].”
1SA.13.1	Saul was 
1SA.13.2	Saul chose for himself 3,000 men of Israel; of whom 2,000 were with him in Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel, while 1,000 were with Jonathan at Gibeah of Benjamin. But he sent the rest of the people away, each one to his own tent. 
1SA.13.3	Jonathan attacked 
1SA.13.4	All Israel heard that Saul had defeated the Philistine garrison, and also that Israel had become despicable to the Philistines. And the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.
1SA.13.5	Now the Philistines gathered to fight against Israel, 30,000 chariots and 6,000 horsemen, and troops in multitude, like sand on the seashore. They came up and camped at Michmash, east of Beth-aven. 
1SA.13.6	When the men of Israel saw that they were in a tight situation (for their troops were hard-pressed), they hid in caves, in thickets, in cellars, and in [dry] cisterns (pits). 
1SA.13.7	Also 
1SA.13.8	Now Saul waited seven days, according to the appointed time which Samuel had set, but Samuel had not come to Gilgal; and the people were scattering away from Saul. 
1SA.13.9	So Saul said, “Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings.” And 
1SA.13.10	As soon as he finished offering the burnt offering, 
1SA.13.11	But Samuel said, “What have you done?” Saul said, “Since I saw that the people were scattering away from me, and that you did not come within the appointed time, and that the Philistines were assembling at Michmash, 
1SA.13.12	therefore, I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not asked for the L
1SA.13.13	Samuel said to Saul, “You have acted foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of the L
1SA.13.14	But now your kingdom shall not endure. The L
1SA.13.15	Then Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul assembled 
1SA.13.16	Saul and his son Jonathan and the people with them were staying in Geba of Benjamin, while the Philistines camped at Michmash. 
1SA.13.17	And the raiding party came from the Philistine camp in three companies: one company turned toward Ophrah, to the land of Shual, 
1SA.13.18	another company turned toward Beth-horon, and another toward the border overlooking the Valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
1SA.13.19	Now no 
1SA.13.20	So all [the men of] Israel went down to the Philistines, each to get his plowshare, pick, axe, or sickle sharpened. 
1SA.13.21	The fee [for sharpening] was a pim (two-thirds of a shekel) for the plowshares, the picks, the pitchforks, and the axes, and to straighten the goads (cattle prods). 
1SA.13.22	So it came about on the day of battle that 
1SA.13.23	And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass at Michmash.
1SA.14.1	One day Jonathan the son of Saul said to his young armor bearer, “Come, let us go over to the Philistine garrison on the other side.” But he did not tell his father. 
1SA.14.2	Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in Migron; and with him were about six hundred men, 
1SA.14.3	and Ahijah the son of Ichabod’s brother Ahitub the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the L
1SA.14.4	Between the passes by which Jonathan sought to cross over to get to the Philistine garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side and a rocky crag on the other side; one [crag] was named Bozez, and the other, Seneh. 
1SA.14.5	The one crag was on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.
1SA.14.6	Jonathan said to his young armor bearer, “Come, let us cross over to the garrison of these uncircumcised men; it may be that the L
1SA.14.7	And his armor bearer said to him, “Do everything that is in your heart (mind); here I am with you 
1SA.14.8	Jonathan said, “See now, we are going to cross over to the [Philistine] men and reveal ourselves to them. 
1SA.14.9	If they say to us, ‘Wait until we come to you,’ then we will stand in our place and not go up to them. 
1SA.14.10	But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ we will go up, for the L
1SA.14.11	When both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines, the Philistines said, “Look, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves.” 
1SA.14.12	So the men of the garrison responded to Jonathan and his armor bearer, “Come up to us and we will tell you something.” Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “Climb up after me, for the L
1SA.14.13	Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, his armor bearer following after him. The enemy fell before Jonathan [in combat], and his armor bearer killed 
1SA.14.14	That first slaughter which Jonathan and his armor bearer made was about twenty men within about half a [plow] furrow in a plot of land [the area of which a yoke of oxen could plow in a day]. 
1SA.14.15	And there was trembling in the [Philistine] camp, in the field, and among all the people; even the garrison and the raiding party trembled [in fear], and the earth quaked and it became a trembling 
1SA.14.16	Saul’s watchmen in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the multitude melted away and they went here and there. 
1SA.14.17	Then Saul said to the people with him, “Take a count and see who has left us.” When they had taken a count, behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were missing. 
1SA.14.18	Saul said to Ahijah [the priest], “Bring the ark of God here.” For at that time the ark of God was with the sons of Israel. 
1SA.14.19	While Saul talked to the priest, the commotion in the Philistine camp continued and increased, so Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.” 
1SA.14.20	Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and went into the battle; and behold, every [Philistine] man’s sword was against his companion, in wild confusion. 
1SA.14.21	Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines previously, who went up with them all around in the camp, they also 
1SA.14.22	When all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines had fled, they too pursued them closely in the battle. 
1SA.14.23	So the L
1SA.14.24	But the men of Israel were hard-pressed that day, because Saul had put the people under a curse, saying, “Cursed be the man who eats food before evening, and before I have taken vengeance on my enemies.” So none of the people ate any food. 
1SA.14.25	All 
1SA.14.26	When the people entered the forest, the honey was dripping, but no man put his hand to his mouth [to taste it], because the people feared the oath [of Saul]. 
1SA.14.27	But Jonathan had not heard when his father put the people under the oath. So he put out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into a honeycomb, and then he put his hand to his mouth, and his 
1SA.14.28	But one of the people told him, “Your father strictly put the people under an oath, saying, ‘Cursed be the man who eats food today.’ ” And the people were exhausted [and hungry]. 
1SA.14.29	Then Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land [with his foolish curse]. See how my 
1SA.14.30	How much better [it would have been] if only the people had eaten freely today from the spoil of their enemies which they found! For now the slaughter among the Philistines has not been great.”
1SA.14.31	They struck the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very tired. 
1SA.14.32	[When night came and the oath ended] the people rushed greedily upon the spoil. They took sheep, oxen, and calves, and slaughtered them on the ground; and they ate them [raw] with the blood [still in them]. 
1SA.14.33	Then Saul was told, “Look, the people are sinning against the L
1SA.14.34	Saul said, “Spread out among the people and tell them, ‘Each one of you bring me his ox or his sheep, and butcher it [properly] here and eat; and do not sin against the L
1SA.14.35	And Saul built an altar to the L
1SA.14.36	Then Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them [alive].” They said, “Do whatever seems good to you.” Then the priest said, “Let us approach God here.” 
1SA.14.37	Saul asked [counsel] of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will You hand them over to Israel?” But He did not answer him that day. 
1SA.14.38	Then Saul said, “Come here, all you who are leaders of the people, and let us find out how this sin [causing God’s silence] happened today. 
1SA.14.39	For as the L
1SA.14.40	Then he said to all the Israelites, “
1SA.14.41	Therefore, Saul said to the L
1SA.14.42	Saul said, “Cast [lots] between me and my son Jonathan.” And Jonathan was selected.
1SA.14.43	Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” So Jonathan told him, “I tasted a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am, I must die!” 
1SA.14.44	Saul answered, “May God do so [to me], and more also [if I do not keep my word], for you shall most certainly die, Jonathan.” 
1SA.14.45	But the people said to Saul, “Must Jonathan, who has brought about this great victory in Israel, be put to death? Far from it! As the L
1SA.14.46	Then Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place.
1SA.14.47	When Saul assumed control of the kingdom of Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side: Moab, the sons (descendants) of Ammon, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he inflicted punishment. 
1SA.14.48	He acted valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, and rescued Israel from the hands of those who had plundered them.
1SA.14.49	Now Saul’s sons were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchi-shua. The names of his two daughters 
1SA.14.50	The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. The commander of his army was named Abner, the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle. 
1SA.14.51	Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
1SA.14.52	Now the war against the Philistines was severe (brutal, relentless) all the days of Saul; and whenever Saul saw any mighty or courageous man, he recruited him for his staff.
1SA.15.1	Samuel said to Saul, “The Lord sent me to anoint you king over His people Israel. Now listen 
1SA.15.2	Thus says the L
1SA.15.3	Now go and strike Amalek and completely destroy everything that they have; do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’ ”
1SA.15.4	So Saul summoned the people and numbered them at Telaim—200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men of Judah. 
1SA.15.5	Saul came to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the valley. 
1SA.15.6	Saul said to the 
1SA.15.7	Saul defeated the Amalekites, from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt. 
1SA.15.8	He captured Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, though he totally destroyed all [the rest of] the people with the sword. 
1SA.15.9	Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fatlings, the lambs, and everything that was good, and they were not willing to destroy them entirely; but everything that was undesirable or worthless they destroyed completely.
1SA.15.10	Then the word of the L
1SA.15.11	“I regret that I made Saul king, for he has turned away from following Me and has not carried out My commands.” Samuel was angry [over Saul’s failure] and he cried out to the L
1SA.15.12	When Samuel got up early in the morning to meet Saul, he was told, “Saul came to 
1SA.15.13	So Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, “Blessed are you of the L
1SA.15.14	But Samuel said, “What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?” 
1SA.15.15	Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best of the sheep and oxen 
1SA.15.16	Then Samuel said to Saul, “Stop, and let me tell you what the L
1SA.15.17	Samuel said, “Is it not true that even though you were small (insignificant) in your own eyes, you were 
1SA.15.18	and the L
1SA.15.19	Why did you not obey the voice of the L
1SA.15.20	Saul said to Samuel, “I have obeyed the voice of the L
1SA.15.21	But the people took some of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the best of the things [that were] to be totally destroyed, to sacrifice to the L
1SA.15.22	Samuel said,
1SA.15.22	“Has the L
1SA.15.22	As in obedience to the voice of the L
1SA.15.22	Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice,
1SA.15.22	And to heed [is better] than the fat of rams.
1SA.15.23	For rebellion is as [serious as] the sin of divination (fortune-telling),
1SA.15.23	And disobedience is as [serious as] false religion and idolatry.
1SA.15.23	Because you have rejected the word of the L
1SA.15.23	He also has rejected 
1SA.15.24	Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned; for I have transgressed the command of the L
1SA.15.25	Now, please, pardon my sin and return with me, so that I may worship the L
1SA.15.26	But Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of the L
1SA.15.27	As Samuel turned to go [away], 
1SA.15.28	So Samuel said to him, “The L

1SA.15.30	Saul said, “I have sinned; but please honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and go back with me, so that I may worship the L
1SA.15.31	So Samuel went back following Saul, and Saul worshiped the L
1SA.15.32	Then Samuel said, “Bring me Agag, the king of the Amalekites.” And Agag came to him 
1SA.15.33	Samuel said, “As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.” And Samuel cut Agag in pieces before the L
1SA.15.34	Then Samuel went to Ramah, but Saul went up to his house in Gibeah of Saul. 
1SA.15.35	Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, for Samuel grieved over Saul. And the L
1SA.16.1	The L
1SA.16.2	But Samuel said, “How can I go? When Saul hears 
1SA.16.3	You shall invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do [after that]; and you shall anoint for Me the one whom I designate.” 
1SA.16.4	So Samuel did what the L
1SA.16.5	And he said, “In peace; I have come to sacrifice to the L
1SA.16.6	So it happened, when they had come, he looked at Eliab [the eldest son] and thought, “Surely the L
1SA.16.7	But the L
1SA.16.8	Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass before Samuel. But Samuel said, “The L
1SA.16.9	Next Jesse had Shammah pass by. And Samuel said, “The L
1SA.16.10	Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, “The L
1SA.16.11	Then Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all your sons here?” Jesse replied, “There is still one left, the youngest; he is tending the sheep.” Samuel said to Jesse, “Send 
1SA.16.12	So Jesse sent 
1SA.16.13	Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed David in the presence of his brothers; and the Spirit of the L
1SA.16.14	Now the Spirit of the L
1SA.16.15	Saul’s servants said to him, “Behold, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you. 
1SA.16.16	Let our lord now command your servants who are here before you to find a man who plays skillfully on the harp; and when the evil spirit from God is on you, he shall play 
1SA.16.17	So Saul told his servants, “Find me a man who plays well and bring him to me.” 
1SA.16.18	One of the young men said, “Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is a skillful musician, a brave 
1SA.16.19	So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me David your son, who is with the flock.” 
1SA.16.20	Jesse took a donkey [loaded with] bread and a jug of wine and a young goat, and sent them to Saul with David his son. 
1SA.16.21	Then David came to Saul and attended him. Saul loved him greatly and [later] David became his armor bearer. 
1SA.16.22	Saul sent 
1SA.16.23	So it came about that whenever the [evil] spirit from God was on Saul, David took a harp and played it with his hand; so Saul would be refreshed and be well, and the evil spirit would leave him.
1SA.17.1	Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle and were assembled at Socoh, which belongs to Judah; and they camped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim. 
1SA.17.2	Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together and they camped in the Valley of Elah, and assembled in battle formation to meet the Philistines. 
1SA.17.3	The Philistines were standing on the mountain on one side and Israel was standing on the mountain on the other side, with the valley between them. 
1SA.17.4	Then a 
1SA.17.5	 a bronze helmet on his head, and wore a coat of scale-armor (overlapping metal plates) which weighed 
1SA.17.6	 bronze shin protectors on his legs and a bronze 
1SA.17.7	The [wooden] shaft of his spear was like a 
1SA.17.8	Goliath stood and shouted to the battle lines of Israel, saying to them, “Why have you come out to draw up for battle? Am I not the Philistine and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves and have him come down to me. 
1SA.17.9	If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will become your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall become our servants and serve us.” 
1SA.17.10	Again the Philistine said, “I defy the battle lines of Israel this day; give me a man so that we may fight together.” 
1SA.17.11	When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.
1SA.17.12	Now David was the son of the 
1SA.17.13	His three older sons had followed Saul into battle. The names of his three sons who went to battle were Eliab, the firstborn; next, Abinadab; and third, Shammah. 
1SA.17.14	David was the youngest. Now the three oldest followed Saul, 
1SA.17.15	but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father’s flock at Bethlehem. 
1SA.17.16	The Philistine [Goliath] came out morning and evening, and took his stand for forty days.
1SA.17.17	Then Jesse said to David his son, “Take for your brothers an ephah of this roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread and run quickly to the camp to your brothers. 
1SA.17.18	Also take these ten cuts of cheese to the commander of the 
1SA.17.19	Now they are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.”
1SA.17.20	So David got up early in the morning, left the flock with a keeper, picked up 
1SA.17.21	Israel and the Philistines drew up in battle formation, army against army. 
1SA.17.22	Then David left his provisions in the care of the supply keeper, and ran to the ranks and came and greeted his brothers. 
1SA.17.23	As he was talking with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine of Gath named Goliath, was coming up from the army of the Philistines, and he spoke these same words 
1SA.17.24	When the men of Israel all saw the man, they fled from him, and were very frightened. 
1SA.17.25	The men of Israel said, “Have you seen this man who is coming up? Surely he is coming up to defy Israel. The king will reward the man who kills him with great riches, and will give him his daughter [in marriage] and make his father’s house (family) free [from taxes and service] in Israel.”
1SA.17.26	Then David spoke to the men who were standing by him, “What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes the disgrace [of his taunting] from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he has taunted 
1SA.17.27	The men 
1SA.17.28	Now Eliab his oldest brother heard what he said to the men; and Eliab’s 
1SA.17.29	But David said, “What have I done now? Was it not just a [harmless] question?” 
1SA.17.30	Then David turned away from Eliab to someone else and asked the same question; and the people gave him the same answer as the first time.
1SA.17.31	When the words that David spoke were heard, the men reported them to Saul, and he sent for him. 
1SA.17.32	David said to Saul, “Let no man’s 
1SA.17.33	Then Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight him. For you are [only] a young man and he has been a warrior since his youth.” 
1SA.17.34	But David said to Saul, “Your servant was tending his father’s sheep. When a lion or a bear came and took a lamb out of the flock, 
1SA.17.35	I went out after it and attacked it and rescued the lamb from its mouth; and when it rose up against me, I seized it by its whiskers and struck and killed it. 
1SA.17.36	Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, since he has taunted 
1SA.17.37	David said, “The L
1SA.17.38	Then Saul dressed David in his garments and put a bronze helmet on his head, and put a coat of mail (armor) on him. 
1SA.17.39	Then David fastened his sword over his armor and tried to walk, [but he could not,] because he was not used to them. And David said to Saul, “I cannot go with these, because I am not used to them.” So David took them off. 
1SA.17.40	Then he took his [shepherd’s] staff in his hand and chose for himself five 
1SA.17.41	The Philistine came and approached David, with his shield-bearer in front of him. 
1SA.17.42	When the Philistine looked around and saw David, he derided 
1SA.17.43	The Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with [shepherd’s] staffs?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. 
1SA.17.44	The Philistine also said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky and the beasts of the field.” 
1SA.17.45	Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, a spear, and a 
1SA.17.46	This day the L
1SA.17.47	and that this entire assembly may know that the L
1SA.17.48	When the Philistine rose and came forward to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine. 
1SA.17.49	David put his hand into his bag and took out a stone and slung it, and it struck the Philistine on his forehead. The stone penetrated his forehead, and he fell face down on the ground.
1SA.17.50	So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and he struck down the Philistine and killed him; but there was no sword in David’s hand. 
1SA.17.51	So he ran and stood over the Philistine, grasped his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their [mighty] champion was dead, they fled. 
1SA.17.52	The men of Israel and Judah stood with a shout and pursued the Philistines as far as the entrance to the valley and the gates of Ekron. And the [fatally] wounded Philistines fell along the way to Shaaraim, even as far as Gath and Ekron. 
1SA.17.53	The sons of Israel returned from their pursuit of the Philistines and plundered their camp. 
1SA.17.54	Then David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his weapons in his tent.
1SA.17.55	When Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner the captain of the army, “Abner, whose son is this young man?” And Abner answered, “By your life, O king, I do not know.” 
1SA.17.56	The king said, “Ask whose son the young man is.” 
1SA.17.57	When David returned from killing [Goliath] the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. 
1SA.17.58	Saul asked him, “Whose son are you, young man?” And David answered, “
1SA.18.1	When David had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was bonded to the soul of David, and 
1SA.18.2	Saul took David that day and did not let him return to his father’s house. 
1SA.18.3	Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself. 
1SA.18.4	Jonathan stripped himself of the outer robe that he was wearing and gave it to David, with his armor, including his sword, his bow, and his belt. 
1SA.18.5	So David went out wherever Saul sent him, and he acted wisely 
1SA.18.6	As they were coming [home], when David returned from killing the Philistine, the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul with tambourines, [songs of] joy, and 
1SA.18.7	The women sang as they played 
1SA.18.7	“Saul has slain his thousands,
1SA.18.7	And David his ten thousands.”
1SA.18.8	Then Saul became very angry, for this saying 
1SA.18.9	Saul looked at David with suspicion [and jealously] from that day forward.
1SA.18.10	Now it came about on the next day that an evil spirit from God came forcefully on Saul, and he raved [madly] inside his house, while David was playing 
1SA.18.11	Saul hurled the spear, for he thought, “I will pin David to the wall.” But David evaded him twice.
1SA.18.12	Now Saul was afraid of David, because the L
1SA.18.13	So Saul had David removed from his presence and appointed him as his commander of a thousand; and he 
1SA.18.14	David acted wisely 
1SA.18.15	When Saul saw that he was prospering greatly, he was afraid of him. 
1SA.18.16	But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he publicly associated with them.
1SA.18.17	Then Saul said to David, “Behold I will give you my older daughter Merab as a wife; only be brave for me and fight the L
1SA.18.18	David said to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my life or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be the king’s son-in-law?” 
1SA.18.19	But at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, she was [instead] given to Adriel the Meholathite as a wife.
1SA.18.20	Now Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved David; and when they told Saul, it pleased him. 
1SA.18.21	Saul said, “I will give her to him so that she may become a snare (bad influence, source of trouble) to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” So Saul said to David for a second time, “You shall be my son-in-law today.” 
1SA.18.22	Then Saul commanded his servants, “Speak to David secretly, saying, ‘Listen, the king delights in you, and all his servants love you; now then, become the king’s son-in-law.’ ” 
1SA.18.23	So Saul’s servants spoke these words to David. But David said, “Is it a trivial thing in your sight to become a king’s son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man and insignificant?” 
1SA.18.24	The servants of Saul told him what David said. 
1SA.18.25	Then Saul said, “This is what you shall say to David: ‘The king wants no dowry except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to take vengeance on the king’s enemies.’ ” Now Saul’s intention was to cause 
1SA.18.26	When his servants told David these words, it pleased him to become the king’s son-in-law. Before the time [for the marriage] arrived, 
1SA.18.27	David arose and went, he and his men, and killed two hundred Philistine men, and David brought their foreskins [as proof of death] and presented 
1SA.18.28	When Saul saw and knew that the L
1SA.18.29	Saul was even more afraid of David; and Saul became David’s constant enemy.
1SA.18.30	Then the Philistine commanders (princes) came out 
1SA.19.1	Now Saul told his son Jonathan and all his servants to kill David, but Jonathan, Saul’s son, greatly delighted in David. 
1SA.19.2	So he told David, “Saul my father is seeking to kill you. Now then, please be on guard in the morning, and stay in a secret place and hide yourself. 
1SA.19.3	As for me, I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak with my father about you, and if I learn anything, then I will tell you.” 
1SA.19.4	Then Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, “May the king not sin against his servant David, since he has not sinned against you, and since his deeds have been very beneficial to you. 
1SA.19.5	For he took his life in his hand and killed the Philistine, and the L
1SA.19.6	Saul listened to Jonathan and swore [an oath], “As the L
1SA.19.7	So Jonathan called David and told him all these things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was 
1SA.19.8	Then there was war again, and David went out and fought with the Philistines and defeated them with a great slaughter, and they fled before him. 
1SA.19.9	Then an evil spirit from the L
1SA.19.10	Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he escaped from Saul’s presence, so that Saul only stuck the spear into the wall. Then David fled and escaped that night.
1SA.19.11	Then Saul sent messengers to David’s house to watch for him, so that he might kill him in the morning. But Michal, David’s wife, told him, “If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.” 
1SA.19.12	So Michal let David down through the window, and he fled and escaped. 
1SA.19.13	And Michal took the 
1SA.19.14	And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, “He is sick.” 
1SA.19.15	Then Saul sent the messengers [again] to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me on his bed [if necessary], so that I may kill him.” 
1SA.19.16	When the messengers came in, there was the 
1SA.19.17	Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me like this and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?” Michal answered Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go! Why should I kill you?’ ”
1SA.19.18	So David fled and escaped and came to Samuel at Ramah, and told him everything that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth. 
1SA.19.19	Saul was told, “David is at Naioth in Ramah.” 
1SA.19.20	Then Saul sent messengers to take David; but when they saw the group of prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing and presiding over them, the Spirit of God came on the messengers of Saul; and they also prophesied. 
1SA.19.21	When Saul was informed, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. So Saul sent messengers again, the third time, and they prophesied as well. 
1SA.19.22	Then Saul went to Ramah himself and came to the great well that is in Secu; and he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?” And he was told, “They are at Naioth [with the prophets] in Ramah.” 
1SA.19.23	So he went on to Naioth in Ramah; and the Spirit of God came upon him too, and he went along continually prophesying until he came to Naioth in Ramah. 
1SA.19.24	He also took off his [royal] robes [and armor] and prophesied before Samuel and lay down naked all that day and night. So they say, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”
1SA.20.1	David fled from Naioth in Ramah and he came and said to Jonathan, “What have I done? What is my 
1SA.20.2	Jonathan said to him, “Far from it! You shall not die. My father does nothing 
1SA.20.3	But David vowed again, saying “Your father certainly knows that I have found favor in your sight, and he has said, ‘Do not let Jonathan know this, or he will be worried.’ But truly as the L
1SA.20.4	Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you say, I will do for you.” 
1SA.20.5	David said to Jonathan, “Behold, tomorrow is the New Moon [observance], and I should sit at the table to eat [the sacrificial meal] with the king; but let me go, so that I may hide myself in the field until the third evening. 
1SA.20.6	If your father misses me at all, then say, ‘David earnestly asked 
1SA.20.7	If he says, ‘All right,’ your servant will be safe; but if he is very angry, then be certain that he has decided on evil. 
1SA.20.8	Therefore show kindness to your servant, because you have brought your servant into a covenant of the L
1SA.20.9	Jonathan said, “Far be it from [happening to] you! In fact, if I indeed learn that my father has decided to harm you, would I not tell you about it?” 
1SA.20.10	Then David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?” 
1SA.20.11	Jonathan said to David, “Come, let us go out into the field [to talk].” So they went out to the field.
1SA.20.12	Then Jonathan said to David, “The L
1SA.20.13	But if it pleases my father 
1SA.20.14	If I am still alive, will you not show me the lovingkindness 
1SA.20.15	You shall never cut off your lovingkindness 
1SA.20.16	So Jonathan made a 
1SA.20.17	Jonathan made David vow again because of his love for him, for Jonathan loved him as himself.
1SA.20.18	Then Jonathan said to David, “Tomorrow is the New Moon [festival], and you will be missed because your seat will be empty. 
1SA.20.19	When you have stayed for three days, you shall go down quickly and come to the place where you hid yourself 
1SA.20.20	I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I shot at a target. 
1SA.20.21	And I will send a boy, 
1SA.20.22	But if I say to the boy, ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you,’ then go, for the L
1SA.20.23	As for the agreement of which you and I have spoken, behold, the L
1SA.20.24	So David hid in the field; and when the New Moon [festival] came, the king sat down to eat food. 
1SA.20.25	The king sat on his seat as on previous occasions, on his seat by the wall; then Jonathan stood up, and Abner [his commander] sat down by Saul’s side, but David’s place was empty. 
1SA.20.26	Yet Saul did not say anything that day, for he thought, “It is an incident [of some kind] and 
1SA.20.27	But on the next day, the second 
1SA.20.28	Jonathan answered Saul, “David earnestly asked me for permission 
1SA.20.29	He said, ‘Please let me go because our family is holding a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to attend. Now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me slip away so that I may see my brothers.’ That is why he has not come to the king’s table.”
1SA.20.30	Then Saul’s anger burned against Jonathan and he said to him, “You son of a 
1SA.20.31	For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you [as heir to the throne] nor your kingdom will be established. So now, send [someone] and bring him to me, for he 
1SA.20.32	Jonathan answered Saul his father, “Why must he be put to death? What has he done?” 
1SA.20.33	Then Saul hurled his spear at him to strike him down, so Jonathan knew [without any doubt] that his father had decided to put David to death. 
1SA.20.34	Then Jonathan stood up from the table in the heat of anger, and ate no food on that second day of the new moon (month), for he grieved 
1SA.20.35	In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for the meeting with David, and a young boy was with him. 
1SA.20.36	And he said to his boy, “Run, please find the arrows which I am about to shoot.” As the boy ran, he shot an arrow past him. 
1SA.20.37	When the boy came to the place where Jonathan had shot the arrow, Jonathan called to him, “Is the arrow not beyond you?” 
1SA.20.38	And Jonathan called out after the boy, “Hurry, be quick, do not stay!” So Jonathan’s boy picked up the arrow and came back to his master. 
1SA.20.39	But the boy was not aware of anything; only Jonathan and David knew about the matter. 
1SA.20.40	Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy and said to him, “Go, take them to the city.” 
1SA.20.41	As soon as the boy was gone, David got up from the south side [beside the mound of stones] and fell on his face to the ground [in submission and respect], and bowed three times. Then they kissed one another and wept together, but David 
1SA.20.42	Jonathan told David, “Go 
1SA.21.1	Then David went to 
1SA.21.2	David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has commissioned me with a matter and has told me, ‘Let no one know anything about the matter for which I am sending you and with which I have commissioned you. I have directed the young men to a certain place.’ 
1SA.21.3	Now what [food] do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever can be found.” 
1SA.21.4	The priest answered David, “There is no ordinary (unconsecrated) bread on hand, but there is 
1SA.21.5	David answered the priest, “Be assured that 
1SA.21.6	So the priest gave him the consecrated 
1SA.21.7	Now one of Saul’s servants was there that day, detained before the L
1SA.21.8	David said to Ahimelech, “Do you not have a sword or spear here on hand? For I brought neither my sword nor my [other] weapons with me, because the king’s business was urgent.” 
1SA.21.9	Then the priest said, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod; if you would take it for yourself, do so. For there is no other here except for it.” And David said, “There is none like that; give it to me.”
1SA.21.10	Then David arose and fled from Saul that day, and went to Achish king of 
1SA.21.11	The servants of Achish said to him, “Is this not David the king of the land? Did they not sing in praise of this one as they danced, saying,
1SA.21.11	‘Saul has slain his thousands,
1SA.21.11	And David his ten thousands’?”
1SA.21.12	David took these words to heart and was greatly afraid of Achish king of Gath. 
1SA.21.13	So [fearing for his life] he changed his behavior in their sight, and acted insanely in their hands, and he scribbled on the doors of the gate, and drooled on his beard. 
1SA.21.14	Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you see that the man is insane. Why have you brought him to me? 
1SA.21.15	Do I lack madmen, that you bring this one to behave like a madman in my presence? Shall this one come into my house?”
1SA.22.1	So David departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam; and when his brothers and all his father’s house heard about it, they went down there to him. 
1SA.22.2	Everyone who was suffering hardship, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented gathered to him; and he became captain over them. There were about four hundred men with him.
1SA.22.3	And David went from there to Mizpah of Moab; and he said to the king of Moab, “Please let my 
1SA.22.4	Then he left them with the king of Moab; and they stayed with him all the time that David was in the 
1SA.22.5	Then the prophet Gad said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold; leave, and go into the land of Judah.” So David left and went into the forest of Hereth.
1SA.22.6	But Saul heard that David and the men who were with him had been discovered. Now Saul was in Gibeah, sitting under the tamarisk tree on the high place with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing around him. 
1SA.22.7	Saul said to his servants who were standing around him, “Listen now, you Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse also give every one of you fields and vineyards? Will he make you all commanders of thousands and hundreds? 
1SA.22.8	For all of you have conspired against me so that no one 
1SA.22.9	Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing with Saul’s servants, replied, “I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech [the priest] the son of Ahitub. 
1SA.22.10	Ahimelech inquired of the L
1SA.22.11	Then the king sent someone to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s household, the priests who were at Nob; and all of them came to the king. 
1SA.22.12	Then Saul said, “Listen now, son of Ahitub.” He replied, “Here I am [at your service], my lord.” 
1SA.22.13	Saul said to him, “Why have you and the son of Jesse conspired against me, in that you have given him bread and a sword and have inquired of God for him, so he would rebel against me by lying in ambush, as 
1SA.22.14	Then Ahimelech answered the king, “And who among all your servants is as faithful 
1SA.22.15	Did I 
1SA.22.16	But Saul said, “Be assured that you shall die, Ahimelech, you and all your father’s household (extended family).” 
1SA.22.17	And the king said to the guards who stood around him, “Turn around and kill the priests of the L
1SA.22.18	So the king said to Doeg, “You turn around and attack the priests.” And Doeg the Edomite turned and 
1SA.22.19	And he struck Nob the city of the priests with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and infants; also 
1SA.22.20	But one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled to David. 
1SA.22.21	Abiathar told David that Saul had murdered the L
1SA.22.22	Then David said to Abiathar, “I knew that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would certainly tell Saul. I have brought about 
1SA.22.23	Stay with me; do not be afraid, for he who seeks my life seeks your life, but you are safe with me.”
1SA.23.1	Then they told David, saying, “Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are plundering (robbing) the threshing floors [of the grain].” 
1SA.23.2	So David inquired of the L
1SA.23.3	But David’s men said to him, “Listen, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we go to Keilah against the battle lines of the Philistines?” 
1SA.23.4	Then David inquired of the L
1SA.23.5	So David and his men went to Keilah and fought the Philistines; he drove away their cattle and struck them with a great slaughter. So David rescued the inhabitants of Keilah.
1SA.23.6	When Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, he came down with an ephod in his hand. 
1SA.23.7	Now when Saul was informed that David had come to Keilah, Saul said, “God has handed him over to me, for he shut himself in by entering a city that has double gates and bars.” 
1SA.23.8	So Saul summoned all the people (soldiers) for war, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men. 
1SA.23.9	But David knew that Saul was plotting evil against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod here.” 
1SA.23.10	Then David said, “O L
1SA.23.11	Will the men of Keilah hand me over to him? Will Saul come down just as Your servant has heard? O L
1SA.23.12	Then David asked, “Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my men to Saul?” The L
1SA.23.13	Then David and his men, about six hundred, arose and left Keilah, and they went wherever they could go. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up the pursuit. 
1SA.23.14	David stayed in the wilderness in strongholds, in the hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph. Saul searched for him every day, but God did not hand David over to him.
1SA.23.15	Now David became aware that Saul had come out to seek his life. David was in the Wilderness of Ziph [in the woods] at Horesh. 
1SA.23.16	And Jonathan, Saul’s son, arose and went [into the woods] to David at Horesh, and 
1SA.23.17	He said to him, “Do not be afraid; the hand of my father Saul will not find you. You will be king over Israel and I will be second in command to you; my father Saul knows this too.” 
1SA.23.18	So the two of them made a covenant before the L
1SA.23.19	Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “Is David not hiding with us in strongholds of Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah, which is south of 
1SA.23.20	Now then, O king, come down [to Ziph] in accordance with all your heart’s desire to do so [and capture him]; and our part shall be to hand him over to the king.” 
1SA.23.21	Saul said, “May you be blessed by the L
1SA.23.22	Go now, be very persistent and investigate, and see where his 
1SA.23.23	So look, and take note of all the places where he hides and come back to me with the established facts, then I will go with you. If he is [anywhere] in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.”
1SA.23.24	So they arose and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah south of Jeshimon. 
1SA.23.25	Then Saul and his men went to search for him. When David was told 
1SA.23.26	Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain. And David was hurrying to get away from Saul, for Saul and his men were surrounding David and his men to capture them. 
1SA.23.27	But a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Hurry and come, because the Philistines have attacked the land.” 
1SA.23.28	So Saul returned from pursuing David and went to meet the Philistines; therefore they called that place the Rock of Escape. 
1SA.23.29	David went up from there and stayed in the strongholds of Engedi.
1SA.24.1	When Saul returned from following the Philistines, he was told, “Behold, David is in the 
1SA.24.2	Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel and went to search for David and his men in front of the Rocks of the Wild Goats. 
1SA.24.3	On the way he came to the 
1SA.24.4	David’s men said to him, “Behold, 
1SA.24.5	Afterward, David’s 
1SA.24.6	He said to his men, “The L
1SA.24.7	So David strongly rebuked his men with these words and did not let them rise up against Saul. Saul got up, left the cave and went on his way.
1SA.24.8	Then David also got up afterward and went out of the cave and called after Saul, saying, “My lord the king!” And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the ground and lay himself face down. 
1SA.24.9	David said to Saul, “Why do you listen to the words of men who say, ‘David seeks to harm you?’ 
1SA.24.10	Behold, your eyes have seen today how the L
1SA.24.11	Look, my father! Indeed, see the hem of your robe in my hand! Since I cut off the hem of your robe and did not kill you, know and understand [without question] that there is no evil or treason in my hands. I have not sinned against you, though you are lying in wait to take my life. 
1SA.24.12	May the L
1SA.24.13	As the proverb of the ancients says, ‘Out of the wicked comes wickedness’; but my hand shall not be against you. 
1SA.24.14	After whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom do you pursue [with three thousand men]? A dead dog, a single flea? 
1SA.24.15	May the L
1SA.24.16	When David had finished saying these words to Saul, Saul said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” Then Saul raised his voice and wept. 
1SA.24.17	He said to David, “You are more righteous 
1SA.24.18	You have declared today the good that you have done to me, for when the L
1SA.24.19	For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away 
1SA.24.20	Now, behold, I know that you will certainly be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand. 
1SA.24.21	So now swear to me by the L
1SA.24.22	David gave Saul his oath; and Saul went home, but David and his men went up to the mountain stronghold.
1SA.25.1	Now Samuel died; and all Israel assembled and mourned for him, and they buried him at his house in Ramah. Then David left and went down to the Wilderness of Paran.
1SA.25.2	Now 
1SA.25.3	(now the man’s name was Nabal and his wife’s name was Abigail. She was intelligent and beautiful in appearance, but the man was harsh and evil in his dealings; he was a 
1SA.25.4	David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep. 
1SA.25.5	So David sent ten young men; and David said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel and go to Nabal, and 
1SA.25.6	and this is what you shall say, ‘
1SA.25.7	Now I have heard that you have shearers. Now your shepherds have been with us and we have not harmed them, nor were they missing anything all the time they were in Carmel. 
1SA.25.8	Ask your young men and they will tell you. Therefore let my young men find favor in your sight [and be well-treated], for we have come on a 
1SA.25.9	When David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all these words in the name of David; then they waited. 
1SA.25.10	But Nabal answered David’s servants and said, “Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? 
1SA.25.11	So should I take my bread and my water and my meat that I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men when I do not know where they are from?” 
1SA.25.12	So David’s young men made their way back and returned; and they came and told him everything that was said [to them by Nabal]. 
1SA.25.13	David said to his men, “Each man put on your sword.” So each man put on his sword. David also put on his sword, and about four hundred men went up behind David while two hundred stayed 
1SA.25.14	But one of 
1SA.25.15	But 
1SA.25.16	They were a wall [of protection] to us both night and day, all the time that we were with them tending the sheep. 
1SA.25.17	Now then, know this and consider what you should do, for evil is [already] planned against our master and against all his household; but he is such a 
1SA.25.18	Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred 
1SA.25.19	She said to her young men (servants), “Go on ahead of me; behold, I am coming after you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal. 
1SA.25.20	It happened that as she was riding on her donkey and coming down by [way of] the hidden part of the mountain, that suddenly David and his men were coming down toward her, and she met them. 
1SA.25.21	Now David had said, “Surely in vain I have protected 
1SA.25.22	May God do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if by morning I leave [alive] even one 
1SA.25.23	When Abigail saw David, she hurried and dismounted from the donkey, and 
1SA.25.24	Kneeling at his feet she said, “My lord, let the blame 
1SA.25.25	Please do not let my lord 
1SA.25.26	So now, my lord, as the L
1SA.25.27	Now this gift, which your maidservant has brought my lord, let it be given to the young men who 
1SA.25.28	Please forgive the transgression of your maidservant; for the L
1SA.25.29	Should anyone rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, then the life of my lord will be bound in the [precious] bundle of the living with the L
1SA.25.30	And it will happen when the L
1SA.25.31	that this [incident] will not cause grief or [bring] a troubled conscience to my lord, both by having shed blood without cause and by my lord having avenged himself. When the L

1SA.25.33	And blessed be your discretion 
1SA.25.34	Nevertheless, as the L
1SA.25.35	So David 
1SA.25.36	Then Abigail came to Nabal, and he was holding a feast in his house [for the shearers], like the feast of a king. And Nabal’s 
1SA.25.37	But in the morning, when 
1SA.25.38	About ten days later, the L
1SA.25.39	When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed be the L
1SA.25.40	When the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel, they said to her, “David sent us to you to take you [to him] to be his wife.” 
1SA.25.41	And she stood and bowed with her face to the ground and said, “Behold, your maidservant is [ready to be] a maid to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.” 
1SA.25.42	Then Abigail quickly got up, and rode on a donkey, with five of her maidens who 
1SA.25.43	David had also taken Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both became his wives.
1SA.25.44	But Saul had given Michal his [younger] daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was from Gallim.
1SA.26.1	The Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “Is David not hiding on the hill of Hachilah, 
1SA.26.2	So Saul arose and went down to the Wilderness of Ziph, taking with him three thousand chosen men of Israel, to search for David [there] in the wilderness of Ziph. 
1SA.26.3	Saul camped on the hill of Hachilah, which is beside the road east of Jeshimon, but David stayed in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul came into the wilderness after him, 
1SA.26.4	David sent out spies, and he learned that Saul was definitely coming. 
1SA.26.5	So David arose and went to the place where Saul had camped, and saw the spot where Saul lay, as well as Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army; and Saul was lying inside the circle of the camp, with the army camped around him.
1SA.26.6	Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, “Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?” And Abishai said, “I will go down with you.” 
1SA.26.7	So David and Abishai went to the army during the night, and there was Saul lying asleep inside the circle of the camp with his spear stuck in the ground by his head; and Abner and the people were lying around him. 
1SA.26.8	Then Abishai said to David, “God has given your enemy into your hand this day; now then, please let me strike him with the spear 
1SA.26.9	But David said to Abishai, “Do not kill him, for who can put out his hand against the L
1SA.26.10	David also said, “As the L
1SA.26.11	The L
1SA.26.12	So David took the spear and the jug of water from 
1SA.26.13	Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on the top of the mountain at a distance, with a large area between them. 
1SA.26.14	David called to the army and to Abner the son of Ner, “Will you not answer, Abner?” Abner replied, “Who are you who calls [and disturbs] the king?” 
1SA.26.15	David said to Abner, “Are you not a [brave] man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not guarded your lord the king? For one of the people came [into your camp] to kill the king your lord. 
1SA.26.16	This thing that you have done is not good. As the L
1SA.26.17	Then Saul recognized David’s voice and said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” And David said, “It is my voice, my lord the king!” 
1SA.26.18	And David said, “Why is my lord pursuing his servant? For what have I done? Or what evil is in my hand? 
1SA.26.19	Now therefore, please let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the L
1SA.26.20	Now then, do not let my blood fall to the ground away from the presence of the L
1SA.26.21	Then Saul said, “I have sinned. Return, my son David, for I will not harm you again because my life was precious in your sight this day. Hear me, I have played the fool and have done a very great wrong [to you].” 
1SA.26.22	David answered, “Look, here is the king’s spear! Now let one of the young men come over and get it. 
1SA.26.23	The L
1SA.26.24	Now behold, just as your life was precious in my sight this day, so let my life be precious in the sight of the L
1SA.26.25	Then Saul said to David, “May you be blessed, my son David; you will both accomplish much and certainly prevail.” So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.
1SA.27.1	But David said in his heart, “Now I will die one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will give up searching for me inside the borders of Israel, and I will escape from his hand [once and for all].” 
1SA.27.2	So David and the six hundred men who were with him arose and crossed over to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath. 
1SA.27.3	And David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, each man with his household, and David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, [who was] Nabal’s widow. 
1SA.27.4	When Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, he no longer searched for him.
1SA.27.5	Then David said to Achish, “If I have found favor in your sight, let me be given a place [of my own] in one of the cities in the country, so that I may live there; for why should your servant live in the royal city with you?” 
1SA.27.6	Then Achish gave David [the town of] Ziklag that day. Therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to 
1SA.27.7	The number of days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a year and four months.
1SA.27.8	Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites [the enemies of Israel that Joshua had failed to annihilate]; for they had inhabited the land from ancient times, as one comes to Shur even as far as the land of Egypt. 
1SA.27.9	David attacked the land and did not leave a man or a woman alive, but he took the sheep, the cattle, the donkeys, the camels, and the clothing, and returned to Achish. 
1SA.27.10	When Achish asked, “Where did you raid today?” David replied, “Against the Negev (the South country) of Judah, and against the Negev of the Jerahmeelites, and against the Negev of the Kenites.” 
1SA.27.11	David did not leave a man or a woman alive to bring 
1SA.27.12	Achish believed David, saying, “He has certainly become hated by his people in Israel; so he will always be my servant.”
1SA.28.1	In those days the Philistines gathered their forces for war to fight against Israel. Achish said to David, “Understand for certain that you and your men will go out with me to battle.” 
1SA.28.2	David said to Achish, “All right, you shall know what your servant can do.” So Achish said to David, “Therefore I will make you my bodyguard for life.”
1SA.28.3	Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had removed the mediums and the spiritists (soothsayers) from the land. 
1SA.28.4	The Philistines assembled and came and camped at Shunem; and Saul gathered all the Israelites and they camped at Gilboa. 
1SA.28.5	When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid and 
1SA.28.6	So Saul inquired of the L
1SA.28.7	Then Saul said to his servants, “Find for me a woman who is a medium [between the living and the dead], so that I may go to her and ask her advice.” His servants said to him, “There is a woman who is a medium at En-dor.”
1SA.28.8	So Saul disguised himself by wearing different clothes, and he left with two men, and they came to the woman at night. He said 
1SA.28.9	But the woman said to him, “See here, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off (eliminated) those who are mediums and spiritists from the land. So why are you laying a trap for my life, to cause my death?” 
1SA.28.10	Then Saul swore [an oath] to her by the L
1SA.28.11	So the woman said, “Whom shall I bring up for you?” He said, “Bring up Samuel for me.” 
1SA.28.12	When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed with a loud voice; and she said to Saul, “Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!” 
1SA.28.13	The king said to her, “Do not be afraid; but [tell me] what do you see?” The woman said to Saul, “I see a 
1SA.28.14	He said to her, “What is his appearance?” And she said, “An old man is coming up, wrapped in a robe.” Then Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground and paid respect [to him].
1SA.28.15	Then Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” Saul answered, “I am greatly distressed; for the Philistines are making war against me, and God has left me and no longer answers me, either through prophets or by dreams; therefore I have called you to make known to me what I should do.” 
1SA.28.16	Samuel said, “Why then do you ask me, since the L
1SA.28.17	The L
1SA.28.18	Because you did not obey the voice of the L
1SA.28.19	Moreover, the L
1SA.28.20	Then Saul immediately fell full length on the earth [floor of the medium’s house], and was very afraid because of Samuel’s words; 
1SA.28.21	The woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly troubled, and she said to him, “Look, your maidservant has obeyed you, and I have taken my life in my hand and have listened to everything you said to me. 
1SA.28.22	So now, please listen to the voice of your maidservant, and let me set a piece of bread before you, and eat, so that you may have strength when you go on your way.” 
1SA.28.23	But he refused and said, “I will not eat.” But his servants together with the woman urged him, and he [finally] listened to them. So he got up from the ground and sat on the bed. 
1SA.28.24	The woman had a fattened calf in the house; she quickly killed it, and took flour, kneaded it and baked unleavened bread. 
1SA.28.25	She brought it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they got up and went away that night.
1SA.29.1	Now the Philistines gathered all their forces at Aphek, while Israel camped by the spring in Jezreel. 
1SA.29.2	As the Philistine lords (governors) were proceeding on [marching] by hundreds and by thousands, and David and his men were proceeding on in the rear with Achish [the king of Gath], 
1SA.29.3	the Philistine commanders [having noticed David] said, “What are these Hebrews 
1SA.29.4	But the Philistine commanders were angry with Achish and they said to him, “Make this man return, so that he may go back to his place where you have assigned him, and do not let him go down to battle with us, or in the battle he may [turn and] become our adversary. For how could David reconcile himself to his lord [Saul]? 
1SA.29.5	Is this not David, of whom they used to sing in dances,
1SA.29.5	‘Saul killed his thousands,
1SA.29.5	And David his ten thousands’?”
1SA.29.6	Then Achish called David and said to him, “As the L
1SA.29.7	So return now and go in peace [to your place], so that you do not displease the Philistine lords.” 
1SA.29.8	David said to Achish, “But what have I done? What have you found in your servant from the day when I [first] came before you to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?” 
1SA.29.9	Achish answered David, “I know that you are blameless in my sight, like an angel of God; nevertheless the commanders of the Philistines have said, ‘He must not go up with us to the battle.’ 
1SA.29.10	So now, get up early in the morning with your master’s servants who have come with you, and as soon as you are up in the morning and have light, leave.” 
1SA.29.11	So David and his men got up early to leave in the morning, to return to the land of the Philistines. But the Philistines went up to Jezreel [to fight against Israel].
1SA.30.1	Now it happened when David and his men came [home] to Ziklag on the third day, [they found] that the Amalekites had made a raid on the Negev (the South country) and on Ziklag, and had overthrown Ziklag and burned it with fire; 
1SA.30.2	and they had taken captive the women [and all] who were there, both small and great. They killed no one, but carried them off [to be used as slaves] and went on their way. 
1SA.30.3	When David and his men came to the town, it was burned, and their wives and their sons and their daughters had been taken captive. 
1SA.30.4	Then David and the people who were with him raised their voices and wept until 
1SA.30.5	Now David’s two wives had been captured, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite. 
1SA.30.6	Further, David was greatly distressed because the people spoke of stoning him, for all of them were embittered, each man for his sons and daughters. But David felt strengthened 
1SA.30.7	David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech’s son, “Please bring me the ephod.” So Abiathar brought him the ephod. 
1SA.30.8	David inquired of the L
1SA.30.9	So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the brook Besor; there those [who could not continue] remained behind. 
1SA.30.10	But David pursued [the Amalekites], he and four hundred men, for two hundred who were too exhausted to cross the brook Besor stayed 
1SA.30.11	They found an Egyptian [who had collapsed] in the field and brought him to David, and gave him bread and he ate, and they gave him water to drink, 
1SA.30.12	and they gave him a piece of a fig cake and two clusters of raisins; and when he had eaten, his 
1SA.30.13	David said to him, “To whom do you belong, and where are you from?” He said, “I am a young man from Egypt, a servant of an Amalekite; and my master abandoned me [as useless] when I fell sick three days ago. 
1SA.30.14	We made a raid on the Negev of the Cherethites, and on that which belongs to Judah, and on the Negev of Caleb, and we burned Ziklag with fire.” 
1SA.30.15	Then David said to him, “Will you take me down to this band [of raiders]?” And he said, “Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or turn me over to the hand of my master, and I will bring you down to this band.”
1SA.30.16	When he brought David down, the Amalekites had disbanded 
1SA.30.17	Then David [and his men] struck them down [in battle] from twilight until the evening of the next day; and not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men who rode camels and fled. 
1SA.30.18	So David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and rescued his two wives. 
1SA.30.19	Nothing of theirs was missing whether small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything that had been taken; David recovered it all. 
1SA.30.20	So David captured all the flocks and herds [which the enemy had], and [the people] drove those animals before him and said, “This is David’s spoil.”
1SA.30.21	David came to the two hundred men who were so exhausted that they could not follow him and had been left at the brook Besor [with the provisions]. They went out to meet David and the people with him, and when he approached the people, he greeted them. 
1SA.30.22	Then all the wicked and worthless men among those who went with David said, “Because they did not go with us, we will give them none of the spoil that we have recovered, except that each man may take his wife and children away and leave.” 
1SA.30.23	David said, “You must not do so, my brothers, with what the L
1SA.30.24	And who will listen to you in regard to this matter? For as is the share of him who goes down into the battle, so shall his share be who stays by the provisions and supplies; they shall share alike.” 
1SA.30.25	So from that day forward he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.
1SA.30.26	When David came to Ziklag, he sent part of the spoil to the elders of Judah, his friends, saying, “Here is a blessing (gift) for you from the spoil of the enemies of the L
1SA.30.27	For those in Bethel, Ramoth of the Negev, Jattir, 
1SA.30.28	Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa, 
1SA.30.29	Racal, the cities of the Jerahmeelites, the cities of the Kenites, 
1SA.30.30	Hormah, Bor-ashan, Athach, 
1SA.30.31	Hebron, and for [those elders in] all the places where David himself and his men were accustomed to go.”
1SA.31.1	Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled before them and fell slain on Mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.2	The Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and they killed Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchi-shua, Saul’s sons. 
1SA.31.3	The battle went heavily against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was severely wounded by the archers. 
1SA.31.4	Saul said to his armor bearer, “Draw your sword and pierce me through with it, otherwise these uncircumcised [Philistines] will come and pierce me through and abuse 
1SA.31.5	When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died with him. 
1SA.31.6	So Saul, his three sons, his armor bearer, and all his men died together on that day.
1SA.31.7	When the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley [of Jezreel], and those who were beyond the Jordan, saw that the 
1SA.31.8	The next day, when the Philistines came to plunder the dead, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.9	So they cut off Saul’s head and stripped off his weapons 
1SA.31.10	And they put Saul’s weapons 
1SA.31.11	When the 
1SA.31.12	all the brave men stood and walked all night, and they took the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and they came to Jabesh and cremated them there. 
1SA.31.13	They took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and fasted [as a sign of mourning and respect] for seven days.
2SA.1.1	Now it happened after the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, that he stayed two days in Ziklag. 
2SA.1.2	On the third day a man came [unexpectedly] from Saul’s camp with his clothes torn and dust on his head [as in mourning]. When he came to David, he bowed to the ground and lay himself face down [in an act of great respect and submission]. 
2SA.1.3	Then David asked him, “Where do you come from?” He said, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.” 
2SA.1.4	David said to him, “How did it go? Please tell me.” He answered, “The people have fled from the battle. Also, many of the people have fallen and are dead; Saul and Jonathan his son are also dead.” 
2SA.1.5	So David said to the young man who informed him, “How do you know Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?” 
2SA.1.6	And the young man who told him explained, “By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and there was Saul leaning on his spear, and the chariots and horsemen [of the Philistines] were close behind him. 
2SA.1.7	When he turned to look behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, ‘Here I am.’ 
2SA.1.8	He asked me, ‘Who are you?’ I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’ 
2SA.1.9	He said to me, ‘Stand up facing me and kill me, for [terrible] agony has come over me, yet I still live [and I will be taken alive].’ 
2SA.1.10	So I stood facing him 
2SA.1.11	Then David grasped his own clothes and tore them [in mourning]; so did all the men who were with him. 
2SA.1.12	They mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and Jonathan his son, and for the L
2SA.1.13	David said to the young man who informed him, “Where are you from?” He answered, “I am the son of a foreigner (resident alien, sojourner), an Amalekite.” 
2SA.1.14	David said to him, “How is it that you were not afraid to put out your hand to destroy the L
2SA.1.15	David called one of the young men and said, “Go, execute him.” So he struck the Amalekite and he died. 
2SA.1.16	David said to the [fallen] man, “
2SA.1.17	Then David sang this dirge (funeral song) over Saul and his son Jonathan, 
2SA.1.18	and he told 
2SA.1.19	“Your glory 
2SA.1.19	How the mighty have fallen!
2SA.1.20	Tell it not in Gath,
2SA.1.20	Proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon,
2SA.1.20	Or the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice,
2SA.1.20	The daughters of the uncircumcised (pagans) will exult.
2SA.1.21	Let not dew or rain be upon you, nor fields with offerings;
2SA.1.21	For there the shield of the mighty was defiled,
2SA.1.21	The shield of Saul, [dry, cracked] not 
2SA.1.22	From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty,
2SA.1.22	The bow of Jonathan did not turn back,
2SA.1.22	And the sword of Saul did not return empty.
2SA.1.23	Saul and Jonathan, beloved and lovely 
2SA.1.23	And in their death they were not separated;
2SA.1.23	They were swifter than eagles,
2SA.1.23	They were stronger than lions.
2SA.1.24	O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,
2SA.1.24	Who clothed you 
2SA.1.24	Who put ornaments of gold on your apparel.
2SA.1.25	How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle!
2SA.1.25	Jonathan lies slain upon your high places.
2SA.1.26	I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan;
2SA.1.26	You have been a good friend to me.
2SA.1.26	Your 
2SA.1.26	Than the love of women.
2SA.1.27	How the mighty have fallen,
2SA.1.27	And the weapons of war have perished!”
2SA.2.1	So it happened after this that David inquired of the L
2SA.2.2	So David went up there [to Hebron] with his two wives also, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel [in Judah]. 
2SA.2.3	And David brought up his men who were with him, each one with his household; and they lived in the cities of Hebron. 
2SA.2.4	Then the men of Judah came and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah.
2SA.2.5	So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said to them, “May you be blessed by the L
2SA.2.6	Now may the L
2SA.2.7	So now, let your hands be strong and be valiant; for your lord Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.”
2SA.2.8	Now [Saul’s cousin] Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul’s army, had taken Ish-bosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to 
2SA.2.9	He made him king over Gilead, over the Ashurites, over Jezreel, over Ephraim, over Benjamin, even over all Israel [except Judah]. 
2SA.2.10	Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he reigned for two years. But the house of Judah followed David. 
2SA.2.11	And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
2SA.2.12	Now Abner the son of Ner and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. 
2SA.2.13	Joab [David’s nephew] the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David also went out and met them by the pool of Gibeon. They sat down, with one group on one side of the pool and the other group on the other side of the pool. 
2SA.2.14	Then Abner said to Joab, “Let the young men now stand and 
2SA.2.15	So they stood up and went over by number, twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David. 
2SA.2.16	Each one of them seized his opponent by the head and 
2SA.2.17	There was a very fierce battle that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David.
2SA.2.18	Three sons of Zeruiah [the half sister of David] were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Now Asahel was as light 
2SA.2.19	Asahel pursued Abner and did not turn to the right or to the left as he followed him. 
2SA.2.20	Then Abner looked behind him and said, “Is that you, Asahel?” He answered, “It is I.” 
2SA.2.21	So Abner said to him, “Turn to your right or to your left, and grab one of the young men and take his armor for yourself.” But Asahel was not willing to turn away from pursuing Abner. 
2SA.2.22	Abner repeated again, “Turn away from following me. Why should I have to strike you to the ground? How would I 
2SA.2.23	But Asahel refused to turn away; so Abner struck him in the abdomen with the 
2SA.2.24	But Joab and Abishai [Asahel’s brothers] pursued Abner. When the sun was going down, they came to the hill of Ammah, which is in front of Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon. 
2SA.2.25	And the sons of [the tribe of] Benjamin gathered together behind Abner and became one troop, and took their stand on the top of a hill. 
2SA.2.26	Then Abner called to Joab, “Must the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitter in the end? How long [will it be] before you tell the people to stop pursuing their brothers?” 
2SA.2.27	Joab said, “As God lives, if you had not spoken, then the people certainly would have stopped pursuing their brothers in the morning.” 
2SA.2.28	So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people halted and no longer pursued Israel, nor did they fight anymore. 
2SA.2.29	Then Abner and his men went through the Arabah (desert region) all that night, crossed the Jordan, went through Bithron and walked the whole morning and came to Mahanaim [where Ish-bosheth ruled Israel].
2SA.2.30	Joab returned from pursuing Abner; and when he had gathered all the people together, nineteen of David’s servants were missing, besides Asahel. 
2SA.2.31	But the servants of David had struck down many of Benjamin and Abner’s men; 
2SA.2.32	And they picked up [the body of] Asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father in Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men walked all night and they arrived in Hebron at daybreak.
2SA.3.1	There was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David; but David grew steadily stronger, while the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker [to the point of being powerless].
2SA.3.2	Sons were born to David in Hebron: his firstborn was Amnon, by Ahinoam of Jezreel; 
2SA.3.3	his second, Chileab, by Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; the third, Absalom the son of [his wife] Maacah, daughter of Talmai the king of Geshur; 
2SA.3.4	the fourth, Adonijah the son of [his wife] Haggith; the fifth, Shephatiah the son of [his wife] Abital; 
2SA.3.5	and the sixth, Ithream, by David’s wife Eglah. These [sons] were born to David in Hebron.
2SA.3.6	Now while war continued between the houses of Saul and David, Abner was proving himself strong in the house of Saul. 
2SA.3.7	Now Saul had a 
2SA.3.8	Then Abner was very angry at the words of Ish-bosheth, and he said, “Am I a dog’s head [a despicable traitor] that belongs to Judah? 
2SA.3.9	May God do so to Abner, and more also, if I do not do for David just as the L
2SA.3.10	to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and establish the throne of David over Israel and Judah from Dan [in the north] to Beersheba [in the south].” 
2SA.3.11	And Ish-bosheth could not say another word to Abner, because he was afraid of him.
2SA.3.12	Then Abner sent messengers to David [who was] in his place [at Hebron], saying, “Whose is the land? Make your covenant (treaty) with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you to bring all Israel over to you.” 
2SA.3.13	David said, “Good! I will make a covenant (treaty) with you, but I require one thing of you: you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come to see 
2SA.3.14	So David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, saying, “
2SA.3.15	So Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband, from Paltiel the son of Laish [to whom Saul had given her]. 
2SA.3.16	But her husband went with her, weeping continually behind her as far as Bahurim. Then Abner told him, “Go, return.” And he did so.
2SA.3.17	Abner talked with the elders (tribal leaders) of Israel, saying, “In times past you were seeking for David to be king over you. 
2SA.3.18	Now then, do it [and make him king]! For the L
2SA.3.19	Abner also spoke 
2SA.3.20	So Abner came to David at Hebron, and [brought] twenty men along with him. And David prepared a feast for Abner and the men with him. 
2SA.3.21	Abner said to David, “Let me stand up and go, and gather all Israel to my lord the king, so that they may make a covenant (treaty) with you, and that you may reign over all that your soul desires.” So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.
2SA.3.22	Then the servants of David came with Joab from a raid and brought a great quantity of spoil with them; but Abner was not with David at Hebron, because David had sent him away, and he had gone in peace. 
2SA.3.23	When Joab and all the army that was with him arrived, they told Joab, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he has gone in peace.” 
2SA.3.24	Then Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you; why did you send him away, so that he is already gone? 
2SA.3.25	You know Abner the son of Ner, that he [only] came to deceive you [with flattering words] and to learn of your going out and coming in, and to find out what you are doing.”
2SA.3.26	When Joab left David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David knew nothing [about Joab’s action]. 
2SA.3.27	So when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside to the middle of the gate to speak to him privately, and there he struck Abner in the abdomen so that he died, 
2SA.3.28	Afterward, when David heard of it, he said, “I and my kingdom are forever innocent before the L
2SA.3.29	Let 
2SA.3.30	So Joab and Abishai his brother murdered Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.
2SA.3.31	Then David said to Joab and to all the people with him, “Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourn before Abner.” And King David walked behind the bier. 
2SA.3.32	They buried Abner in Hebron; and the king raised his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept. 
2SA.3.33	And the king sang a dirge (funeral song) over Abner and said,
2SA.3.33	“Should Abner [the great warrior] die as a fool dies?
2SA.3.34	Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put in fetters;
2SA.3.34	As a man falls before the wicked, so you have fallen.”
2SA.3.34	And all the people wept again over him. 
2SA.3.35	All the people came to urge David to eat food while it was still day; but David took an oath, saying, “May God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets.” 
2SA.3.36	And all the people took notice of it and it 
2SA.3.37	So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the will of the king to put Abner the son of Ner to death. 
2SA.3.38	Then the king said to his servants, “Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel? 
2SA.3.39	Today I am weak, though anointed king; these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too difficult for me. May the L
2SA.4.1	When Saul’s son Ish-bosheth [king of Israel], heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he 
2SA.4.2	Saul’s son had two men who were commanders of [raiding] bands [of soldiers]. One was named Baanah and the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite of the sons (tribe) of Benjamin (for Beeroth is also considered part of [the tribe of] Benjamin, 
2SA.4.3	and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been resident aliens there to this day).
2SA.4.4	Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son whose feet were crippled. He was five years old when the news [of the deaths] of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. And the boy’s nurse picked him up and fled; but it happened that while she was hurrying to flee, he fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth.
2SA.4.5	So the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, left and came to the house of Ish-bosheth in the heat of the day while he was taking his midday rest. 
2SA.4.6	They came into the interior of the house as if to get wheat [for the soldiers], and they struck him in the stomach. Then Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped [unnoticed]. 
2SA.4.7	Now when they entered the house he was lying on his bed in his bedroom. They [not only] struck and killed him, [but] they also beheaded him. Then they took his head and traveled all night by way of the Arabah. 
2SA.4.8	They brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron, and said to the king, “Look, the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life; thus the L
2SA.4.9	David replied to Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, “As the L
2SA.4.10	when a man told me, ‘Behold, Saul is dead,’ 
2SA.4.11	How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous 
2SA.4.12	So David commanded his young men, and they killed them and cut off their hands and feet and hung them beside the pool in Hebron. But they took Ish-bosheth’s head and buried it in Hebron in the tomb of Abner [his relative].
2SA.5.1	Then 
2SA.5.2	In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led Israel out [to war] and brought Israel in [from battle]. And the L
2SA.5.3	So all the elders (tribal leaders) of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the L
2SA.5.4	David was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years. 
2SA.5.5	In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.
2SA.5.6	Now the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who said to David, “You shall not enter here, for the blind and the lame [even the weakest among us] will turn you away”; they thought, “David cannot come in here [because the walls are impenetrable].” 
2SA.5.7	Nevertheless, David captured the stronghold (fortress) of Zion, that is, the City of David. 
2SA.5.8	Then David said on that day, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites, let him go up through the [underground] water shaft to strike the lame and the blind, who are detested by David’s soul [because of their arrogance].” So [for that reason] they say, “The blind or the lame (Jebusites) shall not come into the [royal] house [of Israel].” 
2SA.5.9	So David lived in the stronghold and called it the City of David. And he built all around [the surrounding area] from the 
2SA.5.10	David became greater and greater, for the L
2SA.5.11	Now Hiram the king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees, carpenters, and stonemasons; and they built a house (palace) for David. 
2SA.5.12	And David knew that the L
2SA.5.13	David took more 
2SA.5.14	And these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
2SA.5.15	Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 
2SA.5.16	Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
2SA.5.17	When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to look for him, but he heard about it and went down to the 
2SA.5.18	Now the Philistines had come and spread out [for battle] in the Valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.5.19	David inquired of the L
2SA.5.20	So David came to Baal-perazim, and he defeated them there, and said, “The L
2SA.5.21	The Philistines abandoned their [pagan] idols there, so David and his men took them away [to be burned].
2SA.5.22	The Philistines came up once again and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.5.23	When David inquired of the L
2SA.5.24	And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then you shall pay attention 
2SA.5.25	David did just as the L
2SA.6.1	Again David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. 
2SA.6.2	And David arose and went with all those who were with him to Baale-judah [Kiriath-jearim], to bring up from there [to Jerusalem] the ark of God which is called by the Name—the very Name of the L
2SA.6.3	They placed the ark of God on 
2SA.6.4	So they brought it with the ark of God from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill; and Ahio was walking in front of the ark. 
2SA.6.5	Meanwhile, David and all the house of Israel were celebrating 
2SA.6.6	When they came to Nacon’s threshing floor, Uzzah reached out [with his hand] to the ark of God and took hold of it, because the oxen [stumbled and] nearly overturned it. 
2SA.6.7	And 
2SA.6.8	David became 
2SA.6.9	So David was afraid of the L
2SA.6.10	David was unwilling to move the ark of the L
2SA.6.11	So the ark of the L
2SA.6.12	Now King David was told, “The L
2SA.6.13	And when those who were carrying the ark of the L
2SA.6.14	And David was dancing before the L
2SA.6.15	So David and all the house of Israel were bringing the ark of the L
2SA.6.16	Then, as the ark of the L
2SA.6.17	They brought in the ark of the L
2SA.6.18	When David had finished offering the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the L
2SA.6.19	and distributed to all the people, the entire multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to each a [ring-shaped] loaf of bread, a cake of dates, and a cake of raisins. Then all the people departed, each to his house.
2SA.6.20	Then David returned to bless his household. But [his wife] Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said, “How glorious 
2SA.6.21	So David said to Michal, “It was before the L
2SA.6.22	Yet I will demean myself 
2SA.6.23	Michal the daughter of Saul had no 
2SA.7.1	When King David lived in his house (palace) and the L
2SA.7.2	the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within tent curtains.” 
2SA.7.3	And Nathan said to the king, “Go, do everything that is in your heart, for the L
2SA.7.4	But it happened that night that the word of the L
2SA.7.5	“Go and tell My servant David, ‘Thus says the L
2SA.7.6	For I have not dwelt in a house since the day I brought the sons (descendants) of Israel up from Egypt, even to this day; but I have been moving about in a tent, even in a tabernacle. 
2SA.7.7	Wherever I have gone with all the Israelites, did I speak a word to any from the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people Israel, asking, ‘Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?’ ” ’
2SA.7.8	So now, say this to My servant David, ‘Thus says the L
2SA.7.9	I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make you a great name, like that of the great men of the earth. 
2SA.7.10	I will appoint a place for My people Israel and will plant them, so that they may live in a place of their own and not be disturbed again. The 
2SA.7.11	even from the day that I appointed judges over My people Israel; and I will give you rest from all your enemies. The L
2SA.7.12	When your days are fulfilled and you lie down [in death] with your fathers (ancestors), I will raise up your descendant after you, who shall be born to you, and I will establish his kingdom. 
2SA.7.13	He [is the one who] shall build a house for My 
2SA.7.14	I will be his Father, and he shall be My son. When he commits iniquity (wrongdoing), I will discipline him with the rod of men and with the strokes of the sons of man. 
2SA.7.15	But My lovingkindness 
2SA.7.16	Your house (royal dynasty) and your kingdom will endure forever before Me; your throne will be established forever.” ’ ” 
2SA.7.17	Nathan spoke to David in accordance with all these words and all of this vision.
2SA.7.18	Then King David went in and sat [in prayer] before the L
2SA.7.19	Yet this was very insignificant in Your eyes, O Lord G
2SA.7.20	What more can David say to You? For You know (acknowledge, choose) Your servant, O Lord G
2SA.7.21	Because of Your word (promise), and in accordance with Your own heart, You have done all these great 
2SA.7.22	Therefore You are great, O Lord G
2SA.7.23	What one nation on earth is like Your people Israel, whom God went to redeem for Himself as a people and to make a name for Himself, and to do great and awesome things for Yourself and for Your land, before Your people whom You have redeemed for Yourself from Egypt, 
2SA.7.24	You established for Yourself Your people Israel as Your people forever, and You, O L
2SA.7.25	Now, O L
2SA.7.26	so that Your Name may be magnified forever, saying, ‘The L
2SA.7.27	For You, O L
2SA.7.28	And now, O Lord G
2SA.7.29	Therefore now, may it please You to bless the house (royal dynasty) of Your servant, so that it may continue forever before You; for You, O Lord G
2SA.8.1	Now it came about after this that David defeated the Philistines and subdued (humbled) them, and he took control of Metheg-ammah [the main city] from the hand of the Philistines.
2SA.8.2	He defeated 
2SA.8.3	Then David defeated Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of 
2SA.8.4	David captured from him 1,700 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers. David also hamstrung all the chariot horses (making them lame), but reserved 
2SA.8.5	When the Arameans (Syrians) of Damascus came to help Hadadezer, king of Zobah, David struck down 22,000 Arameans. 
2SA.8.6	Then David put garrisons among the Arameans in Damascus, and the Arameans became his servants and brought tribute. The L
2SA.8.7	David took the shields of gold that were carried by the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 
2SA.8.8	And from Betah and Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took an immense quantity of bronze.
2SA.8.9	When Toi king of Hamath heard about David’s defeat of all the forces of Hadadezer, 
2SA.8.10	Toi sent 
2SA.8.11	King David also dedicated these [gifts] to the L
2SA.8.12	from Aram (Syria), Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and Amalek, and from the spoil of Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
2SA.8.13	So David made a name 
2SA.8.14	He put garrisons in Edom; in all Edom he put garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the L
2SA.8.15	So David reigned over all Israel, and continued to administer justice and righteousness for all his people. 
2SA.8.16	Joab the son of Zeruiah was [commander] over the army; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder (secretary); 
2SA.8.17	Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were the [chief] priests, and Seraiah was the scribe; 
2SA.8.18	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was [head] over both the Cherethites and Pelethites [the king’s bodyguards]; and David’s sons were 
2SA.9.1	And David said, “Is there still anyone left of the house (family) of Saul to whom I may show kindness for Jonathan’s sake?” 
2SA.9.2	There was a servant of the house of Saul whose name was Ziba, so they called him to David. And the king said to him, “Are you Ziba?” He said, “
2SA.9.3	And the king said, “Is there no longer anyone 
2SA.9.4	So the king said to him, “Where is he?” And Ziba replied to the king, “He is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.” 
2SA.9.5	Then King David sent 
2SA.9.6	Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David and fell face down and lay himself down [in respect]. David said, “Mephibosheth.” And he answered, “Here is your servant!” 
2SA.9.7	David said to him, “Do not be afraid, for I will certainly show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan, and will restore to you all the land of your grandfather Saul; and you shall always eat at my table.” 
2SA.9.8	Again Mephibosheth lay himself face down and said, “What is your servant, that you would be concerned for a dead dog like me?”
2SA.9.9	Then the king summoned Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said to him, “I have given your master’s grandson everything that belonged to Saul and to all his house (family). 
2SA.9.10	You and your sons and your servants shall cultivate the land for him, and you shall bring in 
2SA.9.11	Then Ziba said to the king, “Your servant will do according to everything that my lord the king commands.” So Mephibosheth ate at David’s table as one of the king’s sons. 
2SA.9.12	Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Mica. And all who lived in Ziba’s house were servants to Mephibosheth. 
2SA.9.13	So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, for he always ate at the king’s table. And he was lame in both feet.
2SA.10.1	Now it happened later that [Nahash] the king of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun became king in his place. 
2SA.10.2	Then David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, just as his father did to me.” So David sent [a letter along with] some of his servants to console him in regard to his father’s death; and David’s servants came into the land of the Ammonites. 
2SA.10.3	But the princes of the Ammonites [were suspicious and] said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think that David is honoring your father because he has sent comforters to you? Has David not sent his servants to you in order to search the city, to spy it out and overthrow it?” 
2SA.10.4	So Hanun took David’s servants and shaved off half their beards, and cut off their robes in the middle as far as their hips, and sent them away. 
2SA.10.5	When David was informed, he sent [messengers] to meet them [before they reached Jerusalem], for the men were greatly ashamed 
2SA.10.6	When the Ammonites saw that they had become an object of hatred to David, they sent 
2SA.10.7	When David heard about it, he sent Joab and the entire army, the strong 
2SA.10.8	The Ammonites came out and lined up for battle at the entrance of the [city] gate, but the Arameans of Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were [stationed] by themselves in the field.
2SA.10.9	Now when Joab saw that the battlefront was against him in front and in the rear, he selected some of all the choice men in Israel and set them in battle formation to meet the Arameans (Syrians). 
2SA.10.10	But he placed the rest of the men in the hand of his brother Abishai, and he placed them in battle formation to meet the Ammonites. 
2SA.10.11	Joab said [to Abishai], “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I will come to help you. 
2SA.10.12	Be courageous, and let us show ourselves courageous for the benefit of our people and the cities of our God. And may the L
2SA.10.13	So Joab and the people who were with him approached the battle against the Arameans, and they fled before him. 
2SA.10.14	When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had fled, they also fled before Abishai and entered the city. So Joab returned from 
2SA.10.15	When the Arameans saw that they were defeated by Israel, they gathered together. 
2SA.10.16	Hadadezer sent 
2SA.10.17	When David was informed, he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan, and came to Helam. Then the Arameans assembled in battle formation to meet David and fought against him. 
2SA.10.18	But the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed 700 Aramean charioteers and 40,000 horsemen, and struck Shobach the commander of their army, and he died there. 
2SA.10.19	When all the kings serving Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and served them. So the Arameans (Syrians) were afraid to help the Ammonites anymore.
2SA.11.1	Then it happened in the spring, 
2SA.11.2	One evening David got up from his couch and was walking on the [flat] 
2SA.11.3	David sent 
2SA.11.4	David sent messengers and took her. When she came to him, he lay with her. And 
2SA.11.5	The woman conceived; and she sent 
2SA.11.6	Then David sent 
2SA.11.7	When Uriah came to him, David asked him 
2SA.11.8	Then David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house, and wash your feet (spend time at home).” Uriah left the king’s palace, and a 
2SA.11.9	But Uriah slept at the entrance of the king’s palace with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house. 
2SA.11.10	When they told David, “Uriah did not go down to his house,” David said to Uriah, “Have you not [just] come from a [long] journey? Why did you not go to your house?” 
2SA.11.11	Uriah said to David, “The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in huts (temporary shelters), and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field. Should I go to my house to eat and drink and lie with my wife? By your life and the life of your soul, I will not do this thing.” 
2SA.11.12	Then David said to Uriah, “Stay here today as well, and tomorrow I will let you leave.” So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next. 
2SA.11.13	Now David called him [to dinner], and he ate and drank with him, so that he 
2SA.11.14	In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it 
2SA.11.15	He wrote in the letter, “Put Uriah in the front line of the heaviest fighting and leave him, so that he may be struck down and die.” 
2SA.11.16	So it happened that as Joab was besieging the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew the [enemy’s] valiant men were 
2SA.11.17	And the men of the city came out and fought against Joab, and some of the people among the servants of David fell; Uriah the Hittite also died. 
2SA.11.18	Then Joab sent 
2SA.11.19	And he commanded the messenger, “When you have finished reporting all the events of the war to the king, 
2SA.11.20	then if the king becomes angry and he says to you, ‘Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot [arrows] from the wall? 
2SA.11.21	Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth (Gideon)? Was it not a woman who threw an upper millstone on him from the wall so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?’ Then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.’ ”
2SA.11.22	So the messenger left, and he came and told David everything that Joab had sent him 
2SA.11.23	The messenger said to David, “The men indeed prevailed against us and came out to us in the field, but we were on them 
2SA.11.24	Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall. Some of the king’s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.” 
2SA.11.25	Then David said to the messenger, “Tell Joab this, ‘Do not let this thing disturb you, for the sword devours one [side] as well as another. Strengthen your battle against the city and overthrow it’; and so encourage Joab.”
2SA.11.26	When Uriah’s wife [Bathsheba] heard that her husband Uriah was dead, she mourned for her husband. 
2SA.11.27	And when the time of mourning was past, David sent 
2SA.12.1	And the L
2SA.12.1	“There were two men in a city, one rich and the other poor.
2SA.12.2	The rich man had a very large number of flocks and herds,
2SA.12.3	But the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb
2SA.12.3	Which he had purchased and nourished;
2SA.12.3	And it grew up together with him and his children.
2SA.12.3	It ate his food, drank from his cup, it lay in his arms,
2SA.12.3	And was like a daughter to him.
2SA.12.4	Now a traveler (visitor) came to the rich man,
2SA.12.4	And to avoid taking one from his own flock or herd
2SA.12.4	To prepare [a meal] for the traveler who had come to him,
2SA.12.4	He took the poor man’s ewe lamb and prepared it for 
2SA.12.5	Then David’s anger burned intensely against the man, and he said to Nathan, “As the L
2SA.12.6	He shall make restitution for the ewe lamb four times as much [as the lamb was worth], because he did this thing and had no compassion.”
2SA.12.7	Then Nathan said to David, “You are the man! Thus says the L
2SA.12.8	I also gave you your master’s house, and put your master’s wives into your 
2SA.12.9	Why have you despised the word of the L
2SA.12.10	Now, therefore, the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.’ 
2SA.12.11	Thus says the L
2SA.12.12	Indeed you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and 
2SA.12.13	David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the L
2SA.12.14	Nevertheless, because by this deed you have given [a great] opportunity to the enemies of the L
2SA.12.15	Then Nathan went [back] to his home.
2SA.12.16	David therefore appealed to God for the child [to be healed]; and David fasted and went in and lay all night on the ground. 
2SA.12.17	The elders of his household stood by him [in the night] to lift him up from the ground, but he was unwilling [to get up] and would not eat food with them. 
2SA.12.18	Then it happened on the seventh day that the child died. David’s servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, “While the child was still alive, we spoke to him and he would not listen to our voices. How then can we tell him the child is dead, since he might harm himself [or us]?” 
2SA.12.19	But when David saw that his servants were whispering to one another, he realized that the child was dead. So David said to them, “Is the child dead?” And they said, “He is dead.” 
2SA.12.20	Then David got up from the ground, washed, anointed 
2SA.12.21	Then his servants said to him, “What is this thing that you have done? While the child was alive you fasted and wept, but when the child died, you got up and ate food.” 
2SA.12.22	David said, “While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept; for I thought, ‘Who knows, the L
2SA.12.23	But now he is dead; why should I [continue to] fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him [when I die], but he will not return to me.”
2SA.12.24	David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and went to her and lay with her; and she gave birth to a son, and David named him Solomon. And the L
2SA.12.25	and He sent 
2SA.12.26	Now Joab fought against 
2SA.12.27	Joab sent messengers to David and said, “I have fought against Rabbah; I have even taken the city of waters. 
2SA.12.28	So now, assemble the rest of the men, and camp against the city and capture it, or I will take the city myself, and it will be named after me.” 
2SA.12.29	So David gathered all the men together and went to Rabbah, then fought against it and captured it. 
2SA.12.30	And he took the crown of their king from his head; it weighed a 
2SA.12.31	He also brought out the people who were there, and put them to [work with] the saws and sharp iron instruments and iron axes, and made them work at the brickkiln. And he did this to all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all the men returned to Jerusalem.
2SA.13.1	It happened afterwards that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister whose name was Tamar, and Amnon [her half brother] the son of David was in love with her. 
2SA.13.2	Amnon was so frustrated because of his [half-] sister Tamar that he made himself sick, for she was a virgin, and Amnon thought it impossible for him to do anything to her. 
2SA.13.3	But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David’s brother; and Jonadab was a very shrewd (cunning) man. 
2SA.13.4	He said to Amnon, “Why are you, the king’s son, so depressed morning after morning? Will you not tell me?” And Amnon said to him, “I am in love with Tamar, my [half-] brother Absalom’s sister.” 
2SA.13.5	Jonadab said to him, “Go to bed and pretend you are sick; and when your father [David] comes to see you, say to him, ‘Just let my sister Tamar come and serve me food, and let her prepare it in my sight, so that I may see it and eat it from her hand.’ ” 
2SA.13.6	So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick; and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Please let my sister Tamar come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, so that I may eat from her hand.”
2SA.13.7	Then David sent 
2SA.13.8	So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house, and he was in bed. And she took dough and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked them. 
2SA.13.9	She took the pan and dished them out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, “Have everyone leave me.” So everyone left him [except Tamar]. 
2SA.13.10	Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the bedroom, so that I may eat from your hand.” So Tamar took the cakes she had made and brought them into the bedroom to her [half-] brother Amnon. 
2SA.13.11	When she brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her and said, “Come, lie with me, my sister.” 
2SA.13.12	She replied, “No, my brother! Do not violate me, for such a thing is not done in Israel; do not do this disgraceful thing! 
2SA.13.13	As for me, how could I get rid of my shame 
2SA.13.14	But he would not listen to her; and since he was stronger than she, he violated her and lay with her.
2SA.13.15	Then Amnon became extremely hateful toward her, for his hatred toward her was greater than the love which he had for her. And Amnon said to her, “Get up and get out!” 
2SA.13.16	But she said, “No, because this wrong of 
2SA.13.17	Instead, he called his young man who was his personal servant and said, “Now throw this woman out of my 
2SA.13.18	Now Tamar was wearing 
2SA.13.19	So 
2SA.13.20	So her brother Absalom said to her, “Has your brother Amnon been with you? But now keep silent, my sister; he is your brother; 
2SA.13.21	Now when King David heard about all these things, he was very angry [but failed to take any 
2SA.13.22	But Absalom did not speak to Amnon either good or bad; for Absalom hated Amnon because he had violated his sister Tamar.
2SA.13.23	Now it came about after two full years that Absalom had sheepshearers at Baal-hazor near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king’s sons [to a party].
2SA.13.24	Absalom came to [his father] the king and said, “Behold, your servant has sheepshearers; please let the king and his servants go with your servant.” 
2SA.13.25	But the king said to Absalom, “No, my son, we should not all go, for we will be a burden to you.” Although Absalom [strongly] urged David, still he would not go, but he gave him his blessing. 
2SA.13.26	Then Absalom said, “If not, then at least let my brother 
2SA.13.27	But Absalom urged him [again], and he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.
2SA.13.28	Now Absalom commanded his servants, “Notice carefully, when Amnon’s heart is joyous with wine, and when I say to you, ‘Strike Amnon,’ then kill him. Do not be afraid; have I not commanded you myself [and in doing so have I not taken full responsibility for his death]? Be courageous and brave.” 
2SA.13.29	So the servants of Absalom did to Amnon just as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons got up, and every man mounted his mule and fled.
2SA.13.30	Now it happened while they were on the way [back home], that the [exaggerated] report came to David, “Absalom has killed all the king’s sons, and not one of them is left.” 
2SA.13.31	Then the king stood and tore his clothes and lay on the ground [in mourning]; and all his servants were standing by with their clothes torn. 
2SA.13.32	But Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, responded, “Do not let my lord assume that all the king’s sons have been put to death; for only Amnon is dead. This 
2SA.13.33	So now, do not let my lord the king take the report to heart that all the king’s sons are dead; for Amnon alone is dead.”
2SA.13.34	Now Absalom fled. And the young man who kept watch looked up, and behold, many people were coming from the road behind him by the side of the mountain. 
2SA.13.35	And Jonadab said to the king, “Look, the king’s sons are coming. It has turned out just as your servant said.” 
2SA.13.36	And when he finished speaking, the king’s sons came, and they raised their voices and wept; and the king and all his servants also wept very bitterly.
2SA.13.37	But Absalom fled and went to [his mother’s father] Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David 
2SA.13.38	So Absalom fled and went to Geshur, and was there for three years. 
2SA.13.39	And 
2SA.14.1	Now Joab the son of Zeruiah knew that the king’s heart 
2SA.14.2	So Joab sent 
2SA.14.3	Then go to the king and speak to him in this way.” So Joab 
2SA.14.4	When the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she bowed with her face to the ground and lay herself down, and said, “Help, O king.” 
2SA.14.5	The king asked her, “
2SA.14.6	Your maidservant had two sons, but the two of them struggled 
2SA.14.7	Now behold, the entire family has risen against your maidservant, and they say, ‘Hand over the one who killed his brother, so that we may 
2SA.14.8	Then David said to the woman, “Go to your home, and I will give orders concerning you.” 
2SA.14.9	The woman of Tekoa said to the king, “My lord, O king, the guilt is on me and on my father’s house, but the king and his throne are guiltless.” 
2SA.14.10	The king said, “If anyone speaks to you [about this matter], bring him to me [for judgment], and he will not touch you again.” 
2SA.14.11	Then she said, “Please let the king remember the L
2SA.14.12	Then the woman said, “Please let your maidservant speak 
2SA.14.13	The woman said, “Now why have you planned such a thing against God’s people? For in speaking this word the king is like a guilty man, in that the king does not bring back his banished one. 
2SA.14.14	For we will certainly die and are like water that is spilled on the ground and cannot be gathered up again. Yet God does not [simply] take away life, but devises plans so that the one who is banished is not driven away from Him. 
2SA.14.15	Now I came to speak of this matter to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. So your maidservant thought, ‘I will just speak to the king; perhaps the king will do what his maidservant requests. 
2SA.14.16	For the king will hear and save his maidservant from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together from the inheritance of God.’ 
2SA.14.17	Then your maidservant said, ‘Please let the word of my lord the king be comforting, for my lord the king is as the angel of God to discern good and evil. May the L
2SA.14.18	Then the king answered and said to the woman, “Do not hide from me anything that I ask you.” And the woman said, “Let my lord the king please speak.” 
2SA.14.19	The king said, “Is the hand of Joab with you in all of this?” And the woman answered, “As your soul lives, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything that my lord the king has said. Indeed, it was your servant Joab who commanded me; he put all these words in the mouth of your maidservant. 
2SA.14.20	In order to change the appearance of things [between Absalom and you, his father] your servant Joab did this thing. But my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God, to know everything that is in the earth.”
2SA.14.21	Then the king said to Joab, “Listen, I will most certainly do this thing; now go, bring back the young man Absalom.” 
2SA.14.22	Joab bowed his face toward the ground and lay himself down and blessed the king. Then Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord, O king, in that the king has done the request of his servant.” 
2SA.14.23	So Joab got up, went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. 
2SA.14.24	However, the king said, “Let him go to his own house, and do not let him see my face.” So Absalom went to his own house and did not see the king’s face.
2SA.14.25	Now in all Israel there was no man as handsome as Absalom, so highly praised [for that]; from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. 
2SA.14.26	When he cut the hair of his head (for at the end of each year he cut it, because its weight was heavy on him) he weighed the hair of his head at 
2SA.14.27	To Absalom were born three sons and one daughter whose name was 
2SA.14.28	Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, without seeing the king’s face. 
2SA.14.29	So Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him; even when he sent again a second time, he [still] would not come. 
2SA.14.30	Therefore Absalom said to his servants, “See, Joab’s property is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set the field on fire. 
2SA.14.31	Then Joab 
2SA.14.32	Absalom answered Joab, “I sent for you, saying, ‘Come here, so that I may send you to the king to ask, “Why have I come [back] from Geshur? It would be better for me to still be there.” ’ Now then, let me see the king’s face, and if there is guilt in me, let him put me to death.” 
2SA.14.33	So Joab came to the king and told him. Then David called for Absalom, and he came to the king and bowed his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom.
2SA.15.1	After this, Absalom provided for himself a chariot and horses, and fifty men as runners before him. 
2SA.15.2	He would get up early and stand beside the road to the gate [of the city, where court was held]; and when any man who had a dispute came to the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him, “From what city are you?” And he would say, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.” 
2SA.15.3	Then Absalom would say to him, “See, your claims are good and right, but there is no man appointed as the king’s agent to listen to you.” 
2SA.15.4	Moreover Absalom would say, “Oh, that I were appointed judge in the land! Then every man who had a dispute could come to me and I would get justice for him.” 
2SA.15.5	And whenever a man approached to bow down before him, he would put out his hand, take hold of him, and kiss him. 
2SA.15.6	This is how Absalom dealt with everyone in Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
2SA.15.7	And after 
2SA.15.8	For your servant made a vow while I lived at Geshur in Aram (Syria), ‘If the L
2SA.15.9	And [David] the king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he arose and went to Hebron. 
2SA.15.10	But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, you shall say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron.’ ” 
2SA.15.11	Then two hundred men from Jerusalem who were invited [as guests to his sacrificial feast] went with Absalom. They went innocently and knew nothing [about his plan against David]. 
2SA.15.12	And Absalom sent for 
2SA.15.13	Then a messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom.” 
2SA.15.14	David said to all his 
2SA.15.15	The king’s servants said to him, “Listen, your servants 
2SA.15.16	So the king left, and all his household 
2SA.15.17	The king left, and all the people with him, and they stopped at the last house. 
2SA.15.18	All of David’s 
2SA.15.19	Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why should you go with us, too? Go back and stay with the king [of your own country], for you are a foreigner and an exile as well; 
2SA.15.20	You came 
2SA.15.21	But Ittai answered the king, “As the L
2SA.15.22	So David said to Ittai, “Go on and cross over [the Brook Kidron].” So Ittai the Gittite crossed over with all his men and all the little ones who were with him. 
2SA.15.23	While all the country was weeping with a loud voice, all the people crossed over. The king also crossed the Brook Kidron, and all the people went on toward the way of the wilderness [that lies between Jerusalem and the Jordan River].
2SA.15.24	Now Zadok also 
2SA.15.25	Then the king told Zadok, “Take the ark of God back to [its rightful place in] the city [of Jerusalem, the capital]. If I find favor in the L
2SA.15.26	But if He should say, ‘I have no delight in you,’ then here I am; let Him do to me what seems good to Him.” 
2SA.15.27	The king also said to Zadok the priest, “Are you not a seer? Return to the city in peace [you and Abiathar], and your two sons with you, your son Ahimaaz and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. 
2SA.15.28	See, I am going to wait at the 
2SA.15.29	So Zadok and Abiathar brought the ark of God back to Jerusalem, and they stayed there.
2SA.15.30	And David went up the ascent of the 
2SA.15.31	David was told, “Ahithophel [your counselor] is among the conspirators with Absalom.” David said, “O L
2SA.15.32	It happened when David came to the summit [of the Mount of Olives], where he worshiped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his tunic torn and dust on his head [as if in mourning]. 
2SA.15.33	David said to him, “If you go on with me, you will be a burden to me. 
2SA.15.34	But if you return to the city, and say to Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father’s servant in the past, so I will be your servant now;’ then you can thwart (make useless) the advice of Ahithophel for me. 
2SA.15.35	Are not Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there? So it shall be that every word you hear from the king’s palace, you shall report it to them. 
2SA.15.36	Their two sons are there with them, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son; and by them you shall send to me everything that you hear.” 
2SA.15.37	So Hushai, David’s friend, returned to the city, and [at about the same time] Absalom came into Jerusalem.
2SA.16.1	When David was a little past the summit [of the Mount of Olives], behold, Ziba, the servant of 
2SA.16.2	The king said to Ziba, “Why do you have these?” Ziba said, “The donkeys are for the king’s household (family) to ride on, the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine is for anyone to drink who becomes weary in the wilderness.” 
2SA.16.3	Then the king said, “And where is your 
2SA.16.4	Then the king said to Ziba, “
2SA.16.5	When King David came to Bahurim, a man named Shimei, the son of Gera, came out from there. He was of the family of Saul’s household and he was cursing continually as he came out. 
2SA.16.6	He threw stones at David and at all the 
2SA.16.7	This is what Shimei said as he cursed: “Get out, get out, you man of bloodshed, you worthless 
2SA.16.8	The L
2SA.16.9	Then Abishai [David’s nephew], the son of Zeruiah, said to the king, “Why should this dead dog (despicable person) curse my lord the king? Let me go over and take off his head.” 
2SA.16.10	But the king said, “
2SA.16.11	Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “Look, my son [Absalom] who came from my own body, is seeking my life; how much more [reason] now [does] this Benjamite [have to curse me]? Let him alone and let him curse, for [it could be that] the L
2SA.16.12	Perhaps the L
2SA.16.13	So David and his men went on the road; and Shimei went along on the hillside close beside David and cursed as he went and threw stones and dust at him. 
2SA.16.14	The king and all the people who were with him arrived [at the Jordan River] weary, and he refreshed himself there.
2SA.16.15	Then Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, entered Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. 
2SA.16.16	Now it happened when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, came to Absalom, Hushai said to him, “
2SA.16.17	Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?” 
2SA.16.18	Hushai said to Absalom, “No! For whomever the L
2SA.16.19	Besides, whom should I serve? 
2SA.16.20	Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give 
2SA.16.21	Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go in to your father’s 
2SA.16.22	So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof [of the king’s palace], and 
2SA.16.23	The advice of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man had consulted the word of God; that is how all Ahithophel’s counsel was 
2SA.17.1	Then, Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Please let me choose 12,000 men, and I will set out and pursue David tonight. 
2SA.17.2	I will 
2SA.17.3	and I will bring all the people [who follow David] back to you. 
2SA.17.4	So the plan 
2SA.17.5	Nevertheless, Absalom said, “Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he has to say.” 
2SA.17.6	When Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom said to him, “Ahithophel has advised this [plan of action]. Should we do what he says? If not, you speak [and explain why not].” 
2SA.17.7	So Hushai said to Absalom, “Ahithophel has not given good advice this time.” 
2SA.17.8	And Hushai said, “You know your father and his men, that they are brave men, and they are 
2SA.17.9	Behold, he has hidden himself [even] now in one of the ravines or in another place; and when some of 
2SA.17.10	And even the one who is brave, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will completely lose heart 
2SA.17.11	But I advise that all [the men of] Israel be summoned to you, from Dan [in the north] to Beersheba [in the south], like the sand that is by the sea in abundance, and that you personally go into battle. 
2SA.17.12	So shall we come upon David in one of the places where he can be found, and we 
2SA.17.13	If he retreats into a city, then all Israel shall bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it into the ravine until not even a pebble [of it] is found there.” 
2SA.17.14	Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The advice of Hushai the Archite is better than that of Ahithophel.” For the L
2SA.17.15	Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, “This is the advice that Ahithophel gave to Absalom and the elders of Israel, and this is the advice that I have given. 
2SA.17.16	Now then, send 
2SA.17.17	Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz [the priests’ sons] were staying at 
2SA.17.18	But a boy saw them and told Absalom; so the two of them left quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his courtyard, and [with his permission] they went down into it. 
2SA.17.19	And the woman [of the house] took a covering and spread it over the mouth of the well and scattered grain on it; so nothing was discovered. 
2SA.17.20	Then Absalom’s servants came to the woman at the house and asked, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” And the woman said to them, “They have crossed over the brook.” When they searched and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
2SA.17.21	After they left, Jonathan and Ahimaaz came up out of the well and went and informed King David, and said to David, “Arise and cross over the 
2SA.17.22	Then David and all the people who were with him departed and crossed over the Jordan. By daybreak, not even one was left who had not crossed the Jordan.
2SA.17.23	Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and set out and went to his home, to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself. So he died and was buried in the tomb of his father.
2SA.17.24	Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom crossed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. 
2SA.17.25	Absalom put Amasa in command of the army instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man named 
2SA.17.26	So Israel and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead.
2SA.17.27	When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, and Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim 
2SA.17.28	brought beds, basins, pottery, wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, broad beans, lentils, and [other] roasted 
2SA.17.29	honey, cream, sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David and the people who were with him, to eat; for they said, “The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness.”
2SA.18.1	David numbered the men who were with him and set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds. 
2SA.18.2	Then David sent the 
2SA.18.3	But the men said, “You should not go out [to battle with us]. For if in fact we retreat, they will not care about us; even if half of us die, they will not care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. So now it is better that you be 
2SA.18.4	Then the king said to them, “I will do whatever seems best to you.” So the king stood beside the gate [of Mahanaim], and all the army went out in groups of hundreds and of thousands. 
2SA.18.5	The king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, “
2SA.18.6	So the men went out into the field against Israel, and the battle was 
2SA.18.7	The men of Israel [who supported Absalom] were defeated there by the 
2SA.18.8	For the battle there was spread out over the surface of the entire countryside, and the [hazards of the] forest devoured more men that day than did the sword.
2SA.18.9	Now Absalom met the servants of David. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a massive tree, and his 
2SA.18.10	A certain man saw it and informed Joab, saying, “I saw Absalom hanging in a tree.” 
2SA.18.11	Joab said to the man who informed him, “You saw 
2SA.18.12	The man told Joab, “Even if I were to feel the weight of a thousand 
2SA.18.13	Otherwise, if I had acted treacherously against his life (for nothing is hidden from the king) you yourself would have 
2SA.18.14	Joab said, “I will not waste time with you.” So he took three spears in his hand and thrust them through the heart of Absalom while he was still alive [and caught] in the midst of the tree. 
2SA.18.15	And ten young men, Joab’s armor bearers, surrounded and struck Absalom and killed him.
2SA.18.16	Then Joab blew the trumpet [to signal the end of the combat], and the men returned from pursuing Israel, for Joab held them back. 
2SA.18.17	They took [down the body of] Absalom and threw him into a deep pit in the forest and set up a huge mound of stones over him. Then all Israel fled, everyone to his own tent. 
2SA.18.18	Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself a memorial pillar which is in the King’s Valley, for he said, “I have 
2SA.18.19	Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, said, “Let me run and bring the king news that the L
2SA.18.20	But Joab told him, “You are not the man to carry news [to King David] today, but you shall carry news another day. On this day you shall carry no news, because the king’s son is dead.” 
2SA.18.21	Then Joab said to the Cushite (Ethiopian), “Go, tell the king what you have seen.” And the Cushite bowed to Joab and ran. 
2SA.18.22	Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said again to Joab, “But whatever happens, please let me also run after the Cushite.” Joab said, “Why should you run, my son, seeing you will have no messenger’s reward for going [because you have only bad news]?” 
2SA.18.23	“But whatever happens, Let me run.” So Joab said to him, “Run.” Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain [of the Jordan River] and outran the Cushite.
2SA.18.24	Now David was sitting between the two gates; and the lookout went up to the roof of the gate by the wall, and when he raised his eyes and looked, he saw a man running alone. 
2SA.18.25	The lookout called 
2SA.18.26	Then the lookout saw another man running, and he called to the gatekeeper and said, “Look, 
2SA.18.27	The lookout said, “I think the man in front runs like Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.” The king said, “He is a good man and is coming with good news.”
2SA.18.28	And Ahimaaz called out and said to the king, “
2SA.18.29	The king asked, “Is the young man Absalom safe?” Ahimaaz answered, “When Joab sent the king’s servant, and your servant, I saw a great turmoil, but I do not know what 
2SA.18.30	The king told him, “Step aside; stand here.” And he stepped aside and stood still.
2SA.18.31	Behold, the Cushite (Ethiopian) arrived, and said, “Let my lord the king receive good news, for the L
2SA.18.32	The king asked the Cushite, “Is the young man Absalom [my son] safe?” The Cushite replied, “May the enemies of my lord the king, and all those who rise against you to do evil, be [dead] like that young man is.”
2SA.19.1	It was told to Joab, “Behold, the king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.” 
2SA.19.2	So the victory on that day was turned into mourning for all the people, for the people heard it said on that day, “The king grieves for his son.” 
2SA.19.3	The people stole into the city [of Mahanaim] that day, as people who are humiliated 
2SA.19.4	But the king covered his face and cried out with a loud voice, “O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!” 
2SA.19.5	Then Joab came into the house to the king and said, “Today you have put all your servants to shame who this day have saved your life and the lives of your sons and your daughters, and the lives of your wives and 
2SA.19.6	For you love those who hate you and hate those who love you. For you have shown today that commanders and servants are nothing to you; for today I know that if Absalom had lived and all the rest of us had died today, then you would be pleased. 
2SA.19.7	So now stand up, go out and speak kindly 
2SA.19.8	Then the king stood and sat at the gate [of Mahanaim]. And they told all the people, “The king is sitting at the gate,” and all the people came before the king.
2SA.19.9	All the people were quarreling throughout the tribes of Israel, saying, “The king rescued us from the hands of our enemies, and he saved us from the hands of the Philistines, but now he has fled out of the land from Absalom. 
2SA.19.10	And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in battle. So now, why are you [leaders] doing nothing about bringing back the king?”
2SA.19.11	Then King David sent 
2SA.19.12	You are my brothers (relatives, relations); you are my bone and my flesh. Why then are you the last to bring back the king?’ 
2SA.19.13	Say to Amasa [the commander of Absalom’s troops], ‘Are you not my bone and my flesh? May God do so to me, and more also, if you will not be commander of my army from now on in place of Joab.’ ” 
2SA.19.14	In this way he changed the hearts of all the men of Judah as one man, so they sent 
2SA.19.15	So David returned and came to the Jordan. And [supporters from] Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king, to escort him across the Jordan.
2SA.19.16	Then Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men [from the tribe] of Judah to meet King David, 
2SA.19.17	and a thousand men [from the tribe] of Benjamin with him. And Ziba, the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and twenty servants with him, rushed down to the Jordan before the king. 
2SA.19.18	Then they [repeatedly] crossed the ford to bring over the king’s household (family), and to do what pleased him. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king as he was about to cross the Jordan, 
2SA.19.19	and said to the king, “Let not my lord consider me guilty, nor remember what your servant did 
2SA.19.20	For your servant knows that I have sinned; therefore, behold, I have come today, the first of all the 
2SA.19.21	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah said, “Should not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the L
2SA.19.22	David said, “What 
2SA.19.23	Therefore the king said to Shimei, “You shall not be put to death.” And so the king gave him his promise.
2SA.19.24	Then Mephibosheth the [grand]son of Saul came down to meet the king, but he had not cared for his feet, nor trimmed his mustache, nor washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he returned in peace 
2SA.19.25	And when he came to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him, “Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?” 
2SA.19.26	He said, “My lord the king, my servant [Ziba] betrayed me; for I said, ‘Saddle a donkey for me so that I may ride on it and go with the king,’ for your servant is lame [but he took the donkeys and left without me]. 
2SA.19.27	Further, he has slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king is like the angel of God; so do what is good in your eyes. 
2SA.19.28	For were not all of my father’s household (family) nothing but dead men before my lord the king; yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table. So what right do I still have to cry out anymore to the king [for help]?” 
2SA.19.29	The king said to him, “Why speak anymore of your affairs? I have said, ‘You and Ziba shall divide the land.’ ” 
2SA.19.30	Mephibosheth said to the king, “Let him even take it all, since my lord the king has returned to his own house in safety 
2SA.19.31	Now Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim and went on to the Jordan with the king to escort him over the Jordan. 
2SA.19.32	Barzillai was a very old man, eighty years old; and he had provided the king with food while he stayed at Mahanaim, for he was a very great 
2SA.19.33	The king said to Barzillai, “Cross over with me and I will provide for you in Jerusalem with me.” 
2SA.19.34	But Barzillai said to the king, “How much longer have I to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem? 
2SA.19.35	I am this day eighty years old. Can I [be useful to advise you to] discern between good and bad? Can your servant taste what I eat or drink? Can I still hear the voices of singing men and women? Why then should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king? 
2SA.19.36	Your servant would merely cross over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king compensate me with this reward? 
2SA.19.37	Please let your servant return, so that I may die in my own city [and be buried] by the grave of my father and mother. But here is your servant Chimham [my son]; let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him what seems good to you.” 
2SA.19.38	The king answered, “Chimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him what seems good to you; and whatever you ask of me, I will do for you.” 
2SA.19.39	So all the people crossed over the Jordan. When the king had crossed over, he kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his place.
2SA.19.40	Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him; and all the people of Judah and also half the people of Israel accompanied the king. 
2SA.19.41	And all the men of Israel came to the king and said to him, “Why have our brothers (relatives), the men [from the tribe] of Judah, stolen you away and brought the king and his household and all David’s men with him over the Jordan [instead of waiting for us to arrive]?” 
2SA.19.42	Then all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “Because the king is a close relative to us. So why then are you angry about this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king’s 
2SA.19.43	Then the men of 
2SA.20.1	There happened to be there 
2SA.20.1	“We have no portion in David
2SA.20.1	And no inheritance in the son of Jesse,
2SA.20.1	Every man to his tents, O Israel!”
2SA.20.2	So all the men of Israel deserted David and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah stayed faithfully with their king, from the Jordan to Jerusalem.
2SA.20.3	Then David came to his house (palace) at Jerusalem, and the king took the ten women, his 
2SA.20.4	Now the king said to Amasa [the commander of his army], “Summon the [fighting] men of Judah to me within three days, and be present here yourself.” 
2SA.20.5	So Amasa went to summon [the fighting men of] Judah, but he delayed longer than the time which David had set for him. 
2SA.20.6	And David said to Abishai [his nephew], “Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom did. Take your lord’s servants and pursue him, so that he does not find fortified cities for himself and 
2SA.20.7	So Joab’s men went after him, along with [David’s bodyguards] the Cherethites and Pelethites and all the warriors; they went out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri. 
2SA.20.8	When they were at the great stone in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Now Joab was wearing his military uniform, and over it he had a belt with a sheathed sword strapped around his hips; and as he went forward, 
2SA.20.9	Joab said to Amasa, “Is it going well with you, my 
2SA.20.10	But Amasa [who had replaced Joab as David’s commander] was off guard 
2SA.20.11	Now one of Joab’s young men stood by him and said, “Whoever favors Joab and is for David, let him follow Joab!” 
2SA.20.12	But Amasa was wallowing in his blood in the middle of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people who came by stopped [to look], he moved Amasa from the highway into the field and threw a garment over him when he saw that everyone who came by Amasa stopped.
2SA.20.13	When [the body of] Amasa was removed from the highway, everyone followed after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.
2SA.20.14	Now Joab went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, even Beth-maacah, and all the Berites; and they assembled and also went after Sheba. 
2SA.20.15	And 
2SA.20.16	Then a wise woman cried out from the city, “Hear, hear! Tell Joab, ‘Come here so that I may speak to you.’ ” 
2SA.20.17	So when he approached her, the woman asked, “Are you Joab?” He answered, “I am.” Then she said to him, “Listen to the words of your maidservant.” He answered, “I am listening.” 
2SA.20.18	Then she said, “In the past people used to say, ‘They will certainly ask 
2SA.20.19	I am one of the peaceable and faithful in Israel. You are seeking to destroy a city, and a mother in Israel. Why would you swallow up (devour) the inheritance of the L
2SA.20.20	Joab answered, “Far be it, far be it from me that I would swallow up or destroy! 
2SA.20.21	That is not true. But a man of the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand [in rebellion] against King David. Only hand him over, and I will leave the city.” And the woman said to Joab, “Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall.” 
2SA.20.22	Then the woman in her wisdom went to all the people [to inform them of the agreement]. And they beheaded Sheba the son of Bichri and threw his head [down] to Joab. So he blew the trumpet [signaling the end of the attack], and they dispersed from the city, every man to his own tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem to [David] the king.
2SA.20.23	Now Joab was [commander] over the entire army of Israel; Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was [commander] over the Cherethites and Pelethites [the king’s bodyguards]; 
2SA.20.24	Adoram was over the forced labor; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; 
2SA.20.25	Sheva was the scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests; 
2SA.20.26	also Ira the Jairite was a priest to David.
2SA.21.1	There was famine in the days of David for three consecutive years; and David sought the presence (face) of the L
2SA.21.2	So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them (now the Gibeonites were not of the sons (descendants) of Israel but of the remnant (survivors) of the Amorites. The Israelites had sworn [an oath] to [spare] them, but Saul in his zeal for the sons of Israel and Judah had sought to strike down the Gibeonites). 
2SA.21.3	So David said to the Gibeonites, “What should I do for you? How can I make it good so that you will bless the L
2SA.21.4	The Gibeonites said to him, “We will not accept silver or gold belonging to Saul or his household (descendants); nor is it for us to put any man to death in Israel.” David said, “I will do for you whatever you say.” 
2SA.21.5	So they said to the king, “The man who consumed us and planned to exterminate us from remaining in any territory of Israel, 
2SA.21.6	let seven men [chosen] from his sons (descendants) be given to us and we will hang them before the L
2SA.21.7	But the king spared Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the L
2SA.21.8	So the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth, and the five sons of 
2SA.21.9	He handed them over to the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the hill before the L
2SA.21.10	Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest [in the spring] until [the autumn] rain fell on them; and she allowed neither the birds of the sky to rest on their bodies by day, nor the beasts of the field [to feed on them] by night. 
2SA.21.11	David was told what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the 
2SA.21.12	Then David went and took the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the open square of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them on the day when the Philistines had killed Saul in Gilboa. 
2SA.21.13	He brought up the bones of Saul and of Jonathan his son from there, and they gathered the bones of those who had been hanged [with their arms and legs broken]. 
2SA.21.14	They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father; and they did all that the king commanded. After that, God was moved by prayer for the land.
2SA.21.15	Now the Philistines were at war again with Israel. David went down with his servants, and as they fought against the Philistines, David became weary. 
2SA.21.16	Then Ishbi-benob, who was among the descendants of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred 
2SA.21.17	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to David’s aid, and struck and killed the Philistine. Then David’s men swore to him, “You shall not go out again with us to battle, so that you do not extinguish the lamp of Israel.”
2SA.21.18	After this, there was war again with the Philistines at Gob (Gezer). At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph (Sippai), who was among the descendants of the giant. 
2SA.21.19	There was war with the Philistines again at Gob, and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Bethlehemite, killed Goliath the Gittite, whose spear shaft was like a weaver’s beam. 
2SA.21.20	There was war at Gath again, where there was a man of 
2SA.21.21	And when he taunted 
2SA.21.22	These four [warriors] were descended from the giant in Gath, and they fell by the hands of David and his servants.
2SA.22.1	David spoke the words of this song to the L
2SA.22.2	He said:
2SA.22.2	“The L
2SA.22.3	My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge,
2SA.22.3	My Savior—You save me from violence.
2SA.22.4	I call on the L
2SA.22.4	And I am saved from my enemies.
2SA.22.5	For the waves of death encompassed me;
2SA.22.5	The torrents of 
2SA.22.6	The cords of Sheol surrounded me;
2SA.22.6	The snares of death confronted me.
2SA.22.7	In my distress I called upon the L
2SA.22.7	I cried out to my God,
2SA.22.7	And from His temple [in the heavens] He heard my voice;
2SA.22.7	My cry for help 
2SA.22.8	Then the earth shook and quaked,
2SA.22.8	The foundations of the heavens trembled
2SA.22.8	And were shaken, because He was angry.
2SA.22.9	Smoke went up out of His nostrils,
2SA.22.9	And devouring fire from His mouth;
2SA.22.9	Coals were kindled by it.
2SA.22.10	He bowed the heavens also, and came down
2SA.22.10	With thick darkness under His feet.
2SA.22.11	He rode on a cherub and flew;
2SA.22.11	He appeared upon the wings of the wind.
2SA.22.12	He made darkness 
2SA.22.12	A mass of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
2SA.22.13	Out of the brightness before Him
2SA.22.13	Coals of fire were set aflame.
2SA.22.14	The L
2SA.22.14	And the Most High uttered His voice.
2SA.22.15	He sent out arrows and scattered them;
2SA.22.15	Lightning, and confused them.
2SA.22.16	The channels of the sea appeared,
2SA.22.16	The foundations of the world were uncovered
2SA.22.16	At the rebuke of the L
2SA.22.16	At the blast of the breath of His nostrils.
2SA.22.17	He sent from above, He took me;
2SA.22.17	He drew me out of great waters.
2SA.22.18	He rescued me from my strong enemy,
2SA.22.18	From those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.
2SA.22.19	They came upon me in the day of my calamity,
2SA.22.19	But the L
2SA.22.20	He also brought me out to an open place;
2SA.22.20	He rescued me because He delighted in me.

2SA.22.22	For I have kept the ways of the L

2SA.22.23	For all His judgments (legal decisions) were before me,
2SA.22.23	And from His statutes I did not turn aside.
2SA.22.24	I was also blameless before Him,
2SA.22.24	And kept myself from wrongdoing.
2SA.22.25	Therefore the L

2SA.22.28	And You save the afflicted people;
2SA.22.28	But Your eyes are on the haughty 
2SA.22.29	For You, O L
2SA.22.29	The L
2SA.22.30	For by You I can run upon a troop;
2SA.22.30	By my God I can leap over a wall.
2SA.22.31	As for God, His way is blameless 
2SA.22.31	The word of the L
2SA.22.31	He is a shield to all those who take refuge 
2SA.22.32	For who is God, besides the L
2SA.22.32	And who is a rock, besides our God?
2SA.22.33	God is my strong fortress;
2SA.22.33	He sets the blameless in His way.
2SA.22.34	He makes my feet like the doe’s 
2SA.22.34	He sets me [secure and confident] on my high places.
2SA.22.35	He trains my hands for war,
2SA.22.35	So that my arms can bend (pull back) a bow of bronze.
2SA.22.36	You have also given me the shield of Your salvation,
2SA.22.36	And Your help 
2SA.22.37	You enlarge my steps under me,
2SA.22.37	And my feet have not slipped.
2SA.22.38	I pursued my enemies and destroyed them,
2SA.22.38	And I did not turn back until they were consumed (eliminated).
2SA.22.39	I consumed them and shattered them, so that they did not rise;
2SA.22.39	They fell under my feet.
2SA.22.40	For You have surrounded me with strength for the battle;
2SA.22.40	You have subdued under me those who stood against me.
2SA.22.41	You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me [in retreat],
2SA.22.41	And I destroyed those who hated me.
2SA.22.42	They looked, but there was no savior 
2SA.22.43	Then I beat them as [small as] the dust of the earth;
2SA.22.43	I crushed and stamped them as the mire (dirt, mud) of the streets.
2SA.22.44	You also have rescued me from strife with my [own] people;
2SA.22.44	You have kept me as the head of the nations.
2SA.22.44	People whom I have not known served me.
2SA.22.45	Foreigners pretend obedience to me;
2SA.22.45	As soon as they hear [me], they obey me.
2SA.22.46	Foreigners lose heart;
2SA.22.46	They come trembling out of their strongholds.

2SA.22.48	It is God who executes vengeance for me,
2SA.22.48	And brings down [and disciplines] the peoples under me,
2SA.22.49	Who also brings me out from my enemies.
2SA.22.49	You even lift me above those who rise up against me;
2SA.22.49	You rescue me from the violent man.
2SA.22.50	For this I will give thanks 
2SA.22.50	I will sing praises to Your name.
2SA.22.51	He is a tower of salvation 
2SA.22.51	And shows lovingkindness to His anointed,
2SA.22.51	To David and his offspring forever.”
2SA.23.1	Now these are the last words of David.
2SA.23.1	David the son of Jesse declares,
2SA.23.1	The man who was raised on high declares,
2SA.23.1	The anointed of the God of Jacob,
2SA.23.1	And the sweet psalmist of Israel,
2SA.23.2	“The Spirit of the L
2SA.23.2	And His word was on my tongue.
2SA.23.3	The God of Israel,
2SA.23.3	The Rock of Israel spoke to me,
2SA.23.3	‘He who rules over men righteously,
2SA.23.3	Who rules in the fear of God,
2SA.23.4	Is like the morning light 
2SA.23.4	A morning without clouds,
2SA.23.4	Through sunshine after rain.’
2SA.23.5	Truly is not my house so [blessed] with God?
2SA.23.5	For He has made an everlasting covenant with me,
2SA.23.5	Ordered in all things, and secured.
2SA.23.5	For will He not cause to grow 
2SA.23.5	All my salvation and my every wish?
2SA.23.5	Will He not make it grow 
2SA.23.6	But the wicked 
2SA.23.6	Because they cannot be taken with the hand;
2SA.23.7	But the man who touches them
2SA.23.7	Must be armed with iron and the shaft of a spear,
2SA.23.7	And they are utterly burned 
2SA.23.8	These are the names of the mighty men (warriors) whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth, a Tahchemonite, chief of the 
2SA.23.9	Next to him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the son of Ahohi. He was one of the three mighty men with David when they taunted 
2SA.23.10	Eleazar stood up and struck down the Philistines until his hand was weary and clung to the sword. The L
2SA.23.11	Next to Eleazar was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. The Philistines were gathered into an army where there was a plot of ground full of lentils, and the people [of Israel] fled from the Philistines. 
2SA.23.12	But he took his stand in the center of the plot and defended it and struck down the Philistines; and the L
2SA.23.13	Then three of the thirty chief men went down and came to David at harvest time in the cave of Adullam, while an army of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.23.14	David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem. 
2SA.23.15	And David had a craving and said, “Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!” 
2SA.23.16	So the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water from the well of Bethlehem by the gate, and carried and brought it to David. But he would not drink it, but poured it out [in worship] to the L
2SA.23.17	And he said, “Far be it from me, O L
2SA.23.18	Now Abishai the brother of Joab the son of Zeruiah was chief of the 
2SA.23.19	He was the most honored of the thirty, so he became their commander; however, he did not attain to the [greatness of the] three.
2SA.23.20	Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many notable acts, killed two [famous] warriors of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in the middle of a pit on a snowy day. 
2SA.23.21	And he killed an Egyptian, an impressive 
2SA.23.22	These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and gained a reputation beside the three mighty men. 
2SA.23.23	He was honored among the thirty, but he did not attain to the [greatness of the] three. David appointed him over his guard.
2SA.23.24	Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; 
2SA.23.25	Shammah of Harod, Elika of Harod, 
2SA.23.26	Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh of Tekoa, 
2SA.23.27	Abiezer of Anathoth, Mebunnai the Hushathite, 
2SA.23.28	Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai of Netophah, 
2SA.23.29	Heleb the son of Baanah of Netophah, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the Benjamites, 
2SA.23.30	Benaiah of Pirathon, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash, 
2SA.23.31	Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite, 
2SA.23.32	Eliahba of Shaalbon, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan, 
2SA.23.33	Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite, 
2SA.23.34	Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai the son of Maacah, Eliam the son of Ahithophel of Giloh, 
2SA.23.35	Hezro (Hezrai) of Carmel, Paarai the Arbite, 
2SA.23.36	Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,

2SA.23.38	Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 
2SA.23.39	Uriah the Hittite—thirty-seven in all.
2SA.24.1	Now again the anger of the L
2SA.24.2	So the king said to Joab the commander of the army who was with him, “Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan [in the north] to Beersheba [in the south], and conduct a census of the people, so that I may know the number of the people.” 
2SA.24.3	But Joab said to the king, “May the L
2SA.24.4	Nevertheless, the king’s word prevailed against Joab and the commanders of the army. So they went from the king’s presence to take a census of the people of Israel. 
2SA.24.5	They crossed over the Jordan and camped in Aroer, on the south side of the city which is in the middle of the river valley [of the Arnon] toward Gad, and on toward Jazer. 
2SA.24.6	Then they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi, and they came to Dan-jaan and around to Sidon, 
2SA.24.7	and they came to the stronghold of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites, and they went out to the south of Judah, to Beersheba. 
2SA.24.8	So when they had gone about through all the land [taking the census], they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. 
2SA.24.9	And Joab gave the sum of the census of the people to the king. In Israel there were 800,000 valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were 500,000.
2SA.24.10	But David’s heart (conscience) troubled him after he had counted the people. David said to the L
2SA.24.11	When David got up in the morning, the word of the L
2SA.24.12	“Go and say to David, ‘Thus says the L
2SA.24.13	So Gad came to David and told him, and said to him, “Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three months before your enemies as they pursue you? Or shall there be three days of pestilence (plague) in your land? Now consider this and decide what answer I shall return to Him who sent me.” 
2SA.24.14	Then David said to Gad, “I am in great distress. Let us fall into the hands of the L
2SA.24.15	So the L
2SA.24.16	When the [avenging] angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the L
2SA.24.17	When David saw the angel who was striking down the people, he spoke to the L
2SA.24.18	Then Gad [the prophet] came to David that day and said to him, “Go up, set up an altar to the L
2SA.24.19	So David went up according to Gad’s word, as the L
2SA.24.20	Araunah looked down and saw the king and his servants crossing over toward him; and he went out and bowed before the king with his face toward the ground. 
2SA.24.21	Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” And David said, “To buy the threshing floor from you, to build an altar to the L
2SA.24.22	Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take and offer up whatever seems good to him. Look, here are oxen for the burnt offering, and threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood. 
2SA.24.23	All of this, O king, Araunah gives to the king.” And Araunah said to the king, “May the L
2SA.24.24	But the king said to Araunah, “No, but I will certainly buy it from you for a price. I will not offer burnt offerings to the L
2SA.24.25	David built an altar to the L
1KI.1.1	Now King David was 
1KI.1.2	So his servants said to him, “Let a young virgin be found for my lord the king and let her attend him and become his nurse; let her lie against your chest, so that my lord the king may feel warm.” 
1KI.1.3	So they searched for a beautiful girl throughout the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the 
1KI.1.4	The girl was very beautiful; and she became the king’s nurse and served him, but the king 
1KI.1.5	Then Adonijah the son of [David’s wife] Haggith exalted himself, saying, “I [the eldest living son] will be king.” So [following Absalom’s example] he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. 
1KI.1.6	His father [David] had 
1KI.1.7	He had conferred with 
1KI.1.8	But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David’s 
1KI.1.9	Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fattened steers by the Stone of Zoheleth, which is beside [the well] En-rogel; and he invited all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king’s servants [to this feast]. 
1KI.1.10	But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the most formidable warriors, or his brother Solomon.
1KI.1.11	Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, “Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king, and David our lord does not know about it? 
1KI.1.12	Come now, please let me advise you and save your life and the life of your son Solomon. 
1KI.1.13	Go at once to King David and say to him, ‘Did you not, my lord, O king, swear to your maidservant, saying, “Solomon your son shall certainly be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne”? Why then has Adonijah become king?’ 
1KI.1.14	Behold, while you are still there speaking with the king, I will come in after you and confirm your words.”
1KI.1.15	So Bathsheba went to the king in his bedroom. Now the king was very old 
1KI.1.16	So Bathsheba bowed down and paid respect to the king. And the king said, “
1KI.1.17	She said to him, “My lord, you swore by the L
1KI.1.18	But now, behold, Adonijah is [acting as] king; and now [as things stand], my lord the king, you do not know it. 
1KI.1.19	He has sacrificed oxen and fattened steers and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king’s sons and Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army [to a feast], but he did not invite your servant Solomon. 
1KI.1.20	Now as for you, my lord the king, the eyes of all 
1KI.1.21	Otherwise it will come about when my lord the king lies down [in death] with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be considered 
1KI.1.22	While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in. 
1KI.1.23	The king was told, “Here is Nathan the prophet.” And when he came before the king, he bowed before the king with his face to the ground. 
1KI.1.24	Then Nathan said, “My lord the king, have you said, ‘Adonijah shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne’? 
1KI.1.25	Because he has gone down today [to En-Rogel] and has sacrificed oxen and fattened steers and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king’s sons, the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest [to this feast]; and [right now] they are eating and drinking in his presence; and they say, ‘
1KI.1.26	But he has not invited me, your servant, nor Zadok the priest, nor Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, nor your servant Solomon. 
1KI.1.27	If this thing has been done by my lord the king, why have you not shown your servants who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?”
1KI.1.28	King David answered, “Call Bathsheba to me.” And she came into the king’s presence and stood before him. 
1KI.1.29	Then the king swore an oath and said, “As the L
1KI.1.30	even as I swore to you by the L
1KI.1.31	Bathsheba bowed down with her face to the ground, and laid herself face down before the king and said, “May my lord King David live forever!”
1KI.1.32	Then King David said, “Call Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada to me.” And they came before the king. 
1KI.1.33	The king told them, “Take the 
1KI.1.34	Let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel. Then blow the trumpet and say, ‘
1KI.1.35	Then you shall come up [to Jerusalem] after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne and he shall reign 
1KI.1.36	Benaiah [the overseer of the king’s bodyguards], the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, “Amen! (So be it!) May the L
1KI.1.37	Just as the L
1KI.1.38	So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites [the king’s bodyguards] went down [from Jerusalem] and had Solomon ride on King David’s mule, and brought him to [the spring at] Gihon. 
1KI.1.39	Zadok the priest took a horn of [olive] oil from the [sacred] tent and anointed Solomon. They blew the trumpet, and all the people said, “
1KI.1.40	All the people went up after him, and they were playing on flutes and rejoicing with great joy, so that the earth shook 
1KI.1.41	Now Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they finished eating. When Joab heard the trumpet sound, he said, “
1KI.1.42	While he was still speaking, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest arrived. And Adonijah said, “Come in, for you are a valiant 
1KI.1.43	But Jonathan replied to Adonijah, “No, 
1KI.1.44	The king has sent him with Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites; and they have had him ride on the king’s [own royal] mule. 
1KI.1.45	Also, Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon, and they have come up from there celebrating, so the city is in an uproar. This is the noise which you have heard. 
1KI.1.46	Besides, Solomon has taken his seat on the throne of the kingdom. 
1KI.1.47	Moreover, the king’s servants came to bless (congratulate) our lord King David, saying, ‘May 
1KI.1.48	The king has also said this: ‘Blessed be the L
1KI.1.49	Then all Adonijah’s guests were terrified [of being branded as traitors] and stood up 
1KI.1.50	And Adonijah feared Solomon, and he got up and went [to the tabernacle on Mt. Zion] and took hold of the horns of the altar [seeking asylum]. 
1KI.1.51	Now Solomon was told, “Behold, Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon, and behold, he has grasped the horns of the altar [seeking God’s protection], saying, ‘King Solomon must swear to me today that he will not kill his servant with the sword.’ ” 
1KI.1.52	Solomon said, “If he [proves he] is a worthy man, not 
1KI.1.53	So King Solomon sent [soldiers], and they brought Adonijah down from the altar [that was in front of the tabernacle]. And he came and bowed down to King Solomon, and Solomon said to him, “Go to your house.”
1KI.2.1	When David’s time to die approached, he gave instructions to Solomon his son, saying, 
1KI.2.2	“I am going the way of all the earth [as dust to dust]. Be strong and prove yourself a man. 
1KI.2.3	Keep the charge of the L
1KI.2.4	so that the L
1KI.2.5	Now you also know what Joab the son of Zeruiah [my sister] did to me, and what he did to the two commanders of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner and to Amasa the son of Jether, [both of] whom he murdered; 
1KI.2.6	So act in accordance with your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to Sheol (the place of the dead) in peace. 
1KI.2.7	But be gracious 
1KI.2.8	And look, you have with you Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite of Bahurim; he is the one who cursed me with a sinister curse the day I went to Mahanaim. But he came down to meet me at the Jordan [on my return], and I swore to him by the L
1KI.2.9	But now do not let him go unpunished, for you are a wise man; and you will know what to do to him, and you will bring his gray head down to Sheol [covered] with blood.”
1KI.2.10	So David lay down with his fathers [in death] and was buried in the 
1KI.2.11	The time that David reigned over Israel was forty years: he reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. 
1KI.2.12	Then Solomon sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was firmly established.
1KI.2.13	Now Adonijah the son of [David and] Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. She said, “Do you come in peace?” And he said, “In peace.” 
1KI.2.14	Then he said, “I have something 
1KI.2.15	So he said, “You know that the kingdom belonged to me [as the eldest living son] and all Israel 
1KI.2.16	So now I am making one request of you; do not 
1KI.2.17	He said, “Please speak to King Solomon, for he will not refuse you; 
1KI.2.18	Bathsheba replied, “Very well; I will speak to the king for you.”
1KI.2.19	So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose to meet her, bowed before her, and sat down on his throne; then he had a throne set for her, the king’s mother, and she sat on his right. 
1KI.2.20	Then she said, “I am making one small request of you; do not refuse me.” And the king said to her, “Ask, my mother, for I will not refuse you.” 
1KI.2.21	So she said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to your brother Adonijah as a wife.” 
1KI.2.22	King Solomon answered and said to his mother, “And why are you asking for

1KI.2.24	So now, as the L

1KI.2.26	Then the king said to Abiathar the priest, “Go to Anathoth to your own fields, for you 
1KI.2.27	So Solomon dismissed Abiathar [a descendant of Eli] from being priest to the L
1KI.2.28	Now the news reached Joab, for Joab had supported 
1KI.2.29	King Solomon was told that Joab had fled to the tent of the L
1KI.2.30	So Benaiah came to the tent of the L
1KI.2.31	The king said to him, “Do as he has said. 
1KI.2.32	The L
1KI.2.33	So shall their blood return on the head of Joab and the heads of his descendants forever. But for David, his descendants, his house, and his throne, may there be peace from the L
1KI.2.34	So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up [to the tabernacle] and struck and killed Joab, and he was buried at his own house in the wilderness [of Judah]. 
1KI.2.35	The king appointed Benaiah the son of Jehoiada over the army in Joab’s place, and appointed Zadok the priest in place of Abiathar.
1KI.2.36	Now the king sent 
1KI.2.37	For on the day you leave and cross over the 
1KI.2.38	Shimei said to the king, “The word (ruling) is good. As my lord the king has said, so will your servant do.” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem for many days.
1KI.2.39	But it happened after three years, that two of Shimei’s servants ran away to Achish the son of Maacah, the king of 
1KI.2.40	So Shimei arose, saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to [King] Achish to look for his servants. And Shimei went and brought them 
1KI.2.41	Now Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had returned. 
1KI.2.42	So the king sent 
1KI.2.43	Why then have you not kept the oath of the L
1KI.2.44	The king also said to Shimei, “You are aware in your own heart of all the evil you did to my father David; so the L
1KI.2.45	But King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the L
1KI.2.46	So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck down Shimei, and he died.
1KI.3.1	Now Solomon became a son-in-law to Pharaoh king of Egypt [and formed an alliance] by 
1KI.3.2	But [in the meantime] the people were still sacrificing [to God] on the high places (hilltops) [as the pagans did to their idols], for there was no [permanent] house yet built for the

1KI.3.4	The king went to Gibeon [near Jerusalem, where the tabernacle and the bronze altar stood] to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. 
1KI.3.5	In Gibeon the L
1KI.3.6	Then Solomon said, “You have shown Your servant David my father great lovingkindness, because he walked before You in faithfulness and righteousness and with uprightness of heart toward You; and You have kept for him this great lovingkindness, in that You have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is today. 
1KI.3.7	So now, O L
1KI.3.8	Your servant is among Your people whom You have chosen, a great people who are too many to be numbered or counted. 
1KI.3.9	So give Your servant an understanding mind 
1KI.3.10	Now it pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing. 
1KI.3.11	God said to him, “Because you have asked this and have not asked for yourself a long life nor for wealth, nor for the lives of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to recognize justice, 
1KI.3.12	behold, I have done as you asked. I have given you a wise and discerning heart (mind), so that no one before you was your equal, nor shall anyone equal to you arise after you. 
1KI.3.13	I have also given you what you have not asked, both wealth and honor, so that there will not be anyone equal to you among the kings, for all your days. 
1KI.3.14	If you walk in My ways, keeping My statutes and My commandments, as your father David 
1KI.3.15	Then Solomon awoke, and he realized that it was a dream. He came [back] to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the L
1KI.3.16	Then two women who were prostitutes came to the king and stood before him. 
1KI.3.17	And the one woman said, “O my lord, this woman and I live in the same house; and I gave birth to a child while she was in the house. 
1KI.3.18	And on the third day after I gave birth, this woman also gave birth. And we were [alone] together; no one else was with us in the house, just we two. 
1KI.3.19	Now this woman’s son died during the night, because she lay on him [and smothered him]. 
1KI.3.20	So she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from [his place] beside me while your maidservant was asleep, and laid him on her bosom, and laid her dead son on my bosom. 
1KI.3.21	When I got up in the morning to nurse my son, behold, he was dead. But when I examined him carefully in the morning, behold, it was not my son, 
1KI.3.22	Then the other woman said, “No! For my son is the one who is living, and your son is the dead one.” But the first woman said, “No! For your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one.” [This is how] they were speaking before the king.
1KI.3.23	Then the king said, “This woman says, ‘This is my son, the one who is alive, and your son is the dead one’; and the other woman says, ‘No! For your son is the dead one, and my son is the one who is alive.’ ” 
1KI.3.24	Then the king said, “Bring me a sword.” So they brought a sword before the king. 
1KI.3.25	Then the king said, “Cut the living child in two, and give half to the one [woman] and half to the other.” 
1KI.3.26	Then the woman whose child was the living one spoke to the king, for she was deeply moved over her son, “O my lord, give her the living child, and by no means kill him.” But the other said, “He shall be neither mine nor yours; cut 
1KI.3.27	Then the king said, “Give the first woman [who is pleading for his life] the living child, and by no means kill him. She is his mother.” 
1KI.3.28	When all [the people of] Israel heard about the judgment which the king had made, they [were in awe and reverently] feared the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was within him to administer justice.
1KI.4.1	King Solomon was king over all [the people of] Israel. 
1KI.4.2	These were his [chief] officials: Azariah the 
1KI.4.3	Elihoreph and Ahijah the sons of Shisha, were scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder [of important events]; 
1KI.4.4	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was in command of the army; Zadok and Abiathar were priests; 
1KI.4.5	Azariah the son of Nathan was in charge of the deputies; Zabud the son of Nathan was priest and was the king’s friend [and trusted advisor]; 
1KI.4.6	Ahishar was in charge of the household (palace); and Adoniram the son of Abda was in charge of the forced labor.
1KI.4.7	Solomon had twelve deputies over all Israel, who 
1KI.4.8	These were their names: Ben-hur, in the hill country of [the tribe of] Ephraim; 
1KI.4.9	Ben-deker in Makaz and Shaalbim and Beth-shemesh and Elon-beth-hanan; 
1KI.4.10	Ben-hesed, in Arubboth (to him belonged Socoh and all the land of Hepher); 
1KI.4.11	Ben-abinadab, in all the hills of Dor (Taphath, Solomon’s daughter, was his wife); 
1KI.4.12	Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach, Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan below Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah as far as beyond Jokmeam; 
1KI.4.13	Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead (the villages of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead belonged to him, also the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars); 
1KI.4.14	Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim; 
1KI.4.15	Ahimaaz, in [the tribe of] Naphtali (he also married Basemath, Solomon’s daughter); 
1KI.4.16	Baana the son of Hushai, in [the tribe of] Asher and Bealoth; 
1KI.4.17	Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in [the tribe of] Issachar; 
1KI.4.18	Shimei the son of Ela, in [the tribe of] Benjamin; 
1KI.4.19	Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and 
1KI.4.20	[The people of] Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand that is in abundance by the sea; they were eating and drinking and rejoicing.
1KI.4.22	Solomon’s food [for the royal household] for one day was thirty 
1KI.4.23	ten fat oxen, twenty pasture-fed oxen, a hundred sheep not counting fallow deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fattened fowl. 
1KI.4.24	For he was ruling over everything west of the [Euphrates] River, from Tiphsah to Gaza, over all the kings west of the [Euphrates] River; and he had peace on all sides around him. 
1KI.4.25	Judah and Israel lived in security, every man under his vine and fig tree [in peace and prosperity], from Dan [in the north] to Beersheba [in the south], during all the days of Solomon. 
1KI.4.26	Solomon also had 
1KI.4.27	Those deputies provided food for King Solomon and for all [the staff] who came to King Solomon’s table, each in his month; they let nothing be lacking. 
1KI.4.28	They also brought the barley and straw for the horses and swift steeds (warhorses, chargers) to the place where it was needed, each man according to his assignment.
1KI.4.29	Now God gave Solomon [exceptional] wisdom and very great discernment and breadth of mind, like the sand of the seashore. 
1KI.4.30	Solomon’s wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the sons of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt. 
1KI.4.31	For he was wiser 
1KI.4.32	He also spoke 3,000 proverbs, and his songs were 1,005. 
1KI.4.33	He spoke of trees, from the cedar which is in Lebanon to the hyssop [vine] that grows on the wall; he spoke also of animals, of birds, of creeping things, and fish. 
1KI.4.34	People came from all the peoples (nations) to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom.
1KI.5.1	Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon when he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father, for Hiram had always been a friend of David. 
1KI.5.2	Then Solomon sent 
1KI.5.3	“You know that David my father could not build a house (temple) for the Name (Presence) of the L
1KI.5.4	But now that the L
1KI.5.5	Behold, I intend to build a house (temple) to the Name of the L
1KI.5.6	So now, command that they cut cedar trees from Lebanon for me, and my servants will join your servants, and I will give you whatever wages you set for your servants. For you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the men of Sidon.”
1KI.5.7	When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly and said, “Blessed be the L
1KI.5.8	So Hiram sent 
1KI.5.9	My servants will bring the logs down from Lebanon to the [Mediterranean] sea, and I will have them made into rafts 
1KI.5.10	So Hiram gave Solomon all the cedar and cypress timber he desired, 
1KI.5.11	and Solomon gave Hiram 20,000 
1KI.5.12	The L
1KI.5.13	King Solomon levied forced laborers from all Israel; and the forced laborers numbered 30,000 men. 
1KI.5.14	He sent them to Lebanon, 10,000 a month in shifts; one month they were in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was in charge of the forced laborers. 
1KI.5.15	Solomon had 70,000 burden bearers (transporters) and 80,000 stonemasons in the hill country [of Judah], 
1KI.5.16	besides Solomon’s 3,300 chief deputies who were in charge of the project and who were in charge of the people doing the work. 
1KI.5.17	The king gave orders, and they quarried great 
1KI.5.18	So Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the men of 
1KI.6.2	The length of the house which King Solomon built for the L
1KI.6.3	The porch in front of the main room of the house (temple) was twenty cubits long, corresponding to the width of the house, and its depth in front of the house was ten cubits. 
1KI.6.4	He also made framed (artistic) window openings for the house. 
1KI.6.5	Against the wall of the house he built 
1KI.6.6	The lowest story was five cubits wide, the middle was six cubits wide, and the third was seven cubits wide; for he made offsets (niches) 
1KI.6.7	While it was being built, the house was built of stone prepared 
1KI.6.8	The entrance to the lowest side chamber was on the right [or south] side of the house; and they would go up winding stairs to the middle [level], and from the middle to the third. 
1KI.6.9	So Solomon built the house (temple) and finished it, and roofed the house with beams and boards of cedar. 
1KI.6.10	Then he built the extensions [of rooms] against the entire house, each [story] five cubits high; and they were attached to the house with timbers of cedar.
1KI.6.11	Now the word of the L
1KI.6.12	“
1KI.6.13	I will dwell among the sons (descendants) of Israel, and will not abandon My people Israel.”
1KI.6.14	So Solomon built the house (temple) and finished it. 
1KI.6.15	He built the walls of the interior of the house [that is, the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies] with boards of cedar, from the floor of the house to the rafters of the ceiling. He overlaid the interior with wood, and he overlaid the floor of the house with boards of cypress. 
1KI.6.16	He built twenty cubits on the rear of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the ceiling; he built its interior as the [inner] sanctuary, the Holy of Holies. 
1KI.6.17	The [rest of the] house, that is, the temple in front of 
1KI.6.18	The cedar on the house within had wood carvings 
1KI.6.19	Then he prepared the Holy of Holies within the house in order to put the ark of the covenant of the L
1KI.6.20	The Holy of Holies was twenty cubits in length, twenty cubits in width, and twenty cubits in height (a cube), and he overlaid it with pure gold. He also overlaid the cedar altar [with gold]. 
1KI.6.21	Solomon overlaid the interior of the house with pure gold, and he drew 
1KI.6.22	Then he overlaid the entire house with gold, until the whole house was finished. He also overlaid the entire [incense] altar which was by the Holy of Holies with gold.
1KI.6.23	Within the Holy of Holies he made two 
1KI.6.24	One wing of the cherub was five cubits long, and the other wing was 
1KI.6.25	The [wingspan of the] other cherub was also ten cubits. The measurements and cut (shape) of the two cherubim were the same; 
1KI.6.26	the height of the one cherub was ten cubits, as was the other. 
1KI.6.27	He put the cherubim [above the ark] inside the innermost room of the house, and their wings were spread out so that the wing of the one touched one wall, and the wing of the other cherub was touching the other wall; and their inner wings were touching 
1KI.6.28	Solomon also overlaid the cherubim with gold.
1KI.6.29	He carved all the walls of the house all around with carved engravings of cherubim, palm-shaped decorations, and open flowers, [both] the inner and the outer 
1KI.6.30	He overlaid the floor of the house with gold, [both] the inner and outer 
1KI.6.31	For the entrance of the Holy of Holies he made two [folding] doors of olive wood, the lintel (header above the door) and five-sided doorposts (frames). 
1KI.6.32	So 
1KI.6.33	Also he made for the entrance of the [outer] sanctuary (the Holy Place) four-sided doorposts (frames) of olive wood 
1KI.6.34	and two doors of cypress wood; the two leaves of the one door turned on pivots 
1KI.6.35	He carved cherubim, palm-shaped decorations, and open flowers 
1KI.6.36	He built the inner courtyard with three rows of cut stone and a row of cedar beams.
1KI.6.37	In the fourth year [of King Solomon’s reign] the foundation of the L
1KI.6.38	In the eleventh year [of King Solomon’s reign] in the month of Bul (October-November), that is, the eighth month, the house was finished throughout all its parts and in accordance with all its specifications. So he built it in seven years.
1KI.7.1	Now Solomon built his own house (palace) 
1KI.7.2	He also built the House of the Forest of Lebanon; its length was a hundred 
1KI.7.3	And it was covered with cedar [as a roof] on the supporting beams that were upon the forty-five pillars, fifteen in each row. 
1KI.7.4	 frames in three rows, and window was opposite window in three tiers. 
1KI.7.5	All the doorways and doorposts [and windows] had squared [artistic] frames, and window was opposite window in three tiers.
1KI.7.6	He also made the Hall of Pillars; its length was fifty cubits (75 ft.) and its width thirty cubits (45 ft.). There was a porch in front, and pillars and a threshold in front of them.
1KI.7.7	He made the hall for the throne where he was to judge, the Hall of Judgment; it was paneled with cedar from [one] floor to [another] floor.
1KI.7.8	His house where he was to live, the other courtyard behind the hall, was of similar workmanship. Solomon also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had married.
1KI.7.9	All these were of expensive stones, of stone cut according to measure, sawed with saws, inside and outside; even from the foundation to the coping, and from the outside to the great courtyard.
1KI.7.10	The foundation was of expensive stones, large stones, stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits. 
1KI.7.11	And above [the foundation] were expensive stones, stones cut according to measure, and cedar. 
1KI.7.12	So the great courtyard all around had three rows of cut stone and a row of cedar beams like the inner courtyard of the house of the L
1KI.7.13	Now King Solomon sent 
1KI.7.14	He was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a craftsman in bronze. Hiram was filled with wisdom, understanding, and skill for doing any [kind of] work in bronze. So he came to King Solomon and did all his [bronze] work.
1KI.7.15	He cast the two pillars of bronze; the one pillar was eighteen cubits high, and a [measuring] line of twelve cubits measured the circumference of both. 
1KI.7.16	He also made two capitals (crowns) of cast bronze to put on the tops of the pillars; the height of one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits. 
1KI.7.17	 nets of network (lattice-work) and twisted threads (wreaths) of chainwork for the capitals which were on the tops of the pillars, seven for one capital and seven for the other. 
1KI.7.18	So Hiram made the pillars [in this manner], and two rows around on the one network to cover the capitals which were on the top of the pomegranates; and he did the same for the other capital. 
1KI.7.19	The capitals which were upon the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily work (design), four cubits. 
1KI.7.20	The capitals were on the two pillars and also above and close to the rounded projection which was beside the network. There were two hundred pomegranates in rows around both capitals. 
1KI.7.21	Hiram set up the pillars at the porch of the temple; he set up the right pillar and named it Jachin (may he establish), and he set up the left pillar and named it Boaz (in it is strength). 
1KI.7.22	On the tops of the pillars was lily work (design). So the work of the pillars was finished.
1KI.7.23	Now he made the Sea (basin) of cast 
1KI.7.24	Under its brim were gourds encircling it ten to a cubit, completely surrounding the Sea; the gourds were in two rows, cast in one piece with it. 
1KI.7.25	It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three west, three south, and three east; the Sea 
1KI.7.26	It was a hand width thick, and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held two thousand 
1KI.7.27	Then Hiram made ten bronze stands [for smaller basins]; the length of each stand was four cubits, its width was four cubits and its height was three cubits. 
1KI.7.28	This was the design of the stands: they had borders between the frames. 
1KI.7.29	On the borders between the frames were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and on the frames there was a pedestal above. Beneath the lions and oxen were borders of hanging work. 
1KI.7.30	Now each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles, and its four feet had supports [for a basin]. Beneath the basin were cast supports with borders at each side. 
1KI.7.31	Its opening inside the crown at the top 
1KI.7.32	Underneath the borders were four wheels, and the axles of the wheels were on the stand. And the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half. 
1KI.7.33	The wheels were made like a chariot wheel: their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all cast. 
1KI.7.34	Now there were four supports at the four corners of each stand; the supports were part of the stand itself. 
1KI.7.35	On the top of the stand there was a circular piece half a cubit high, and on the top of the stand its supports and borders were part of it. 
1KI.7.36	And on the surface of its supports and its borders Hiram engraved cherubim, lions, and palm-shaped decorations, according to the [available] space for each, with borders all around. 
1KI.7.37	He made the ten stands like this: they all had one casting, one measure, and one form.
1KI.7.38	Then he made ten basins of bronze; each basin held forty baths and was four cubits, and there was one basin on each of the ten stands. 
1KI.7.39	Then he placed the bases, five on the right [or south] side of the house and five on the left [or north] side; and he set the Sea [of cast metal] on the right side of the house toward the southeast.
1KI.7.40	Now Hiram made the basins and the shovels and the bowls. So Hiram finished all the work which he did for King Solomon on the house of the L
1KI.7.41	the two pillars and the [two] bowls of the capitals which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on top of the pillars; 
1KI.7.42	and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars; 
1KI.7.43	the ten stands and the ten basins on the stands; 
1KI.7.44	one Sea (basin), and the twelve oxen under the Sea; 
1KI.7.45	the pails, the shovels, and the bowls; all these utensils which Hiram made for King Solomon in the house of the L
1KI.7.46	In the plain of the Jordan [River] the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan. 
1KI.7.47	Solomon left all the utensils 
1KI.7.48	Solomon made all the [other] furniture which was in the house of the L
1KI.7.49	the lampstands of pure gold, five on the right side and five on the left, in front of the Holy of Holies (inner sanctuary); with the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs of gold; 
1KI.7.50	the cups, snuffers, bowls, spoons, firepans—of pure gold; and the hinges of gold [both] for the doors of the inner house, the Holy of Holies, and for the doors of the house, the main room [the Holy Place].
1KI.7.51	So all the work that King Solomon did on the house of the L
1KI.8.1	Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the fathers’ 
1KI.8.2	All the men of Israel assembled before King Solomon at the feast in the month of Ethanim (September-October), that is, the seventh month. 
1KI.8.3	All the elders of Israel came, and the priests carried the ark. 
1KI.8.4	They brought up the ark of the L
1KI.8.5	King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who had assembled before him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, so many that they could not be counted or numbered. 
1KI.8.6	Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the L
1KI.8.7	For the cherubim spread their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its [carrying] poles from above. 
1KI.8.8	The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were visible from the Holy Place that was in front of the 
1KI.8.9	There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone which Moses put there at Horeb (Sinai), where the L
1KI.8.10	Now it happened that when the priests had come out of the Holy Place, the cloud filled the L
1KI.8.11	so the priests could not stand [in their positions] to minister because of the cloud, for the glory 
1KI.8.12	Then Solomon said,
1KI.8.12	“The L
1KI.8.13	I have certainly built You a lofty house,
1KI.8.13	A place for You to dwell in forever.”
1KI.8.14	Then the king turned around and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel was standing. 
1KI.8.15	He said, “Blessed be the L
1KI.8.16	‘Since the day that I brought My people Israel out of Egypt, I did not choose a [particular] city out of all the tribes of Israel 
1KI.8.17	Now it was [determined] in the heart of my father David to build a house (temple) for the Name of the L
1KI.8.18	But the L
1KI.8.19	Nevertheless, you shall not build the house, but your son, who shall be born to you, it is he who shall build it for My Name [and My Presence].’ 
1KI.8.20	Now the L
1KI.8.21	There I have made a place [in the Holy of Holies] for the ark, in which is the covenant (solemn agreement) of the L
1KI.8.22	Then Solomon stood [in the courtyard] before the altar of the L
1KI.8.23	He said, “O L
1KI.8.24	You who have kept what You 
1KI.8.25	Now therefore, O L
1KI.8.26	Now, O God of Israel, please let Your word which You have spoken to Your servant David my father be confirmed.
1KI.8.27	But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain You; how much less this house which I have built! 
1KI.8.28	Yet graciously consider the prayer of Your servant and his supplication, O L
1KI.8.29	that Your eyes may be open toward this house night and day, toward the place of which You have said, ‘My Name (Presence) shall be there,’ that You may listen to the prayer which Your servant shall pray toward this place. 
1KI.8.30	Listen to the prayer of Your servant and of Your people Israel which they pray toward this place. Hear in heaven, Your dwelling place; hear and forgive.
1KI.8.31	“If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take an oath [of innocence] and he comes to take the oath before Your altar in this house (temple), 
1KI.8.32	then hear from heaven and act and judge Your servants, condemning the wicked by bringing his guilt on his own head, and justifying the righteous by rewarding him in accordance with his righteousness.
1KI.8.33	“When Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against You, and 
1KI.8.34	then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and bring them back to the land which You gave their fathers.
1KI.8.35	“When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against You, and they pray toward this place and praise Your name and turn from their sin when You afflict them, 
1KI.8.36	then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants and of Your people Israel; indeed, teach them the good way in which they should walk (live). And send rain on Your land which You have given to Your people as an inheritance.
1KI.8.37	“If there is famine in the land, or if there is pestilence (plague), blight, mildew, migratory locusts, or grasshoppers, if their enemy besieges them in the land of their cities, whatever affliction 
1KI.8.38	whatever prayer or pleading is made by any individual, or by Your people Israel, each knowing the affliction of his own heart, and spreading his hands out toward this house; 
1KI.8.39	then hear in heaven Your dwelling place, and forgive and act and give to each according to his ways, whose heart (mind) You know, for You and You alone know the hearts of all the children of men,

1KI.8.54	When Solomon finished offering this entire prayer and supplication to the L
1KI.8.55	And he stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying,
1KI.8.56	“Blessed be the L
1KI.8.57	May the L

1KI.9.4	As for you, if you walk (live your life) before Me, as David your father walked, in integrity of heart and in uprightness, acting in accordance with everything that I have commanded you, and will keep My statutes and My precepts, 
1KI.9.5	then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, just as I promised your father David, saying, ‘You shall not be without a man (descendant) on the throne of Israel.’
1KI.9.6	“But if you or your sons turn away from following Me, and do not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them, 
1KI.9.7	then I will cut off Israel from the land which I have given them, and I will cast out of My sight the house which I have consecrated for My Name 
1KI.9.8	This house (temple) will become a heap of ruins; everyone who passes by will be appalled and 
1KI.9.9	And they [who know] will say, ‘Because they abandoned the L
1KI.9.10	Now at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the two houses, the temple of the L
1KI.9.11	(Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with as much cedar and cypress timber [from Lebanon] and gold as he desired), at that time King Solomon gave Hiram 
1KI.9.12	So Hiram came from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him, and they 
1KI.9.13	He said, “What are these cities [good for] which you have given me, my brother?” So they have been called the land of Cabul (like nothing, unproductive) to this day. 
1KI.9.14	And Hiram sent to the king 120 talents of gold.
1KI.9.15	Now this is the account of the forced labor which King Solomon conscripted to build the house of the L
1KI.9.16	 Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and taken Gezer, burned it with fire and killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and he had given it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife. 
1KI.9.17	So Solomon rebuilt [and fortified] Gezer and Lower Beth-horon, 
1KI.9.18	Baalath and 
1KI.9.19	and all the storage cities [for surplus provisions] which Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots and cities for his horsemen, and whatever it pleased Solomon to build 
1KI.9.20	 all the people who were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not of the sons (descendants) of Israel, 
1KI.9.21	their children who were left after them in the land, whom the Israelites were unable to completely destroy, from them Solomon levied (conscripted) forced laborers, even to this day (the date of this writing). 
1KI.9.22	But Solomon did not make slaves of the sons of Israel; for they were men of war (soldiers), his servants, his officers, his captains, his chariot commanders, and his horsemen.
1KI.9.23	These were the chief officers who were over Solomon’s work, five hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people doing the work.
1KI.9.24	As soon as Pharaoh’s daughter came up from the City of David to her house which Solomon had built for her, then he built the Millo (fortification).
1KI.9.25	Three times a year [during the 
1KI.9.26	King Solomon built a fleet of ships in Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea (Sea of Reeds), in the land of Edom. 
1KI.9.27	And Hiram [king of Tyre] sent his servants with the fleet, sailors who knew the sea, along with the servants of Solomon. 
1KI.9.28	They came to 
1KI.10.1	Now when the queen of 
1KI.10.2	So she came to Jerusalem with a very large caravan (entourage), with camels carrying spices, a great quantity of gold, and precious stones. When she came to Solomon, she spoke with him about everything that was on her mind [to discover the extent of his wisdom]. 
1KI.10.3	Solomon 
1KI.10.4	When the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house (palace) which he had built, 
1KI.10.5	the food on his table, the seating of his servants (court officials), the attendance of his waiters and their attire, his cupbearers, his 
1KI.10.6	Then she told the king, “The report which I heard in my own land about your words and wisdom is true! 
1KI.10.7	I did not believe the report until I came and saw it with my own eyes. Behold, the half of it was not told to me. You exceed in wisdom and prosperity the report which I heard. 
1KI.10.8	How blessed (fortunate, happy) are your men! How blessed are these your servants who stand continually before you, hearing your wisdom! 
1KI.10.9	Blessed be the L
1KI.10.10	She gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold and a very great 
1KI.10.11	Also the ships of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir a great 
1KI.10.12	From the almug wood (sandalwood) the king made pillars for the house of the L
1KI.10.13	King Solomon [in turn] gave to the queen of Sheba everything that she wanted, whatever she asked, besides what he gave to her 
1KI.10.14	Now the weight of the gold that came to Solomon in one [particular] year was six hundred and sixty-six 
1KI.10.15	besides 
1KI.10.16	King Solomon made two hundred large shields of beaten (hammered) gold; 
1KI.10.17	 three hundred 
1KI.10.18	Also the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with the finest gold. 
1KI.10.19	The throne had six steps, and a round 
1KI.10.20	Twelve lions stood there, one on either end of each of the six steps; there was nothing like it made for any other kingdom. 
1KI.10.21	All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. None were of silver; it was not considered valuable in the days of Solomon. 
1KI.10.22	For the king had at sea the [large cargo] ships of Tarshish with the ships of Hiram. Once every three years the ships of Tarshish came bringing gold, silver, ivory, monkeys, and peacocks.
1KI.10.23	So King Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in wealth and in wisdom. 
1KI.10.24	All the earth was seeking the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom which God had put in his mind. 
1KI.10.25	Every man brought a gift [of tribute]: articles of silver and gold, garments, weapons, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year.
1KI.10.26	Now Solomon collected chariots and horsemen; he had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, which he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. 
1KI.10.27	The king made silver 
1KI.10.28	Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from 
1KI.10.29	A chariot could be imported from Egypt for six hundred 
1KI.11.1	Now king Solomon [defiantly] loved 
1KI.11.2	from the very nations of whom the L
1KI.11.3	He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred 
1KI.11.4	For when Solomon was old, his wives turned his heart away after other gods; and his heart was not completely devoted to the L
1KI.11.5	For Solomon went after Ashtoreth, the [fertility] goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the horror (detestable idol) of the Ammonites. 
1KI.11.6	Solomon did evil [things] in the sight of the L
1KI.11.7	Then Solomon built a 
1KI.11.8	And he did the same for all of his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.
1KI.11.9	So the L
1KI.11.10	and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not follow other gods; but he did not observe (remember, obey) what the L
1KI.11.11	Therefore the L

1KI.11.13	However, I will not tear away all the kingdom; I will give one tribe (Judah) to your son for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem which I have chosen.”
1KI.11.14	Then the L
1KI.11.15	For it came about, when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army had gone up to bury those killed [in battle] and had struck down every male in Edom 
1KI.11.16	(for Joab and all [the army of] Israel stayed there six months, until he had killed every male in Edom), 
1KI.11.17	that Hadad escaped to Egypt, he and some Edomites from his father’s servants with him, while Hadad was [still] a little boy. 
1KI.11.18	They set out from Midian [south of Edom] and came to Paran, and took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave [young] Hadad a house and ordered food 
1KI.11.19	Hadad found great favor with Pharaoh, so that he gave Hadad in marriage the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen. 
1KI.11.20	The sister of Tahpenes gave birth to Genubath, Hadad’s son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s household among the sons of Pharaoh. 
1KI.11.21	But when Hadad heard in Egypt that David 
1KI.11.22	Then Pharaoh said to him, “But what have you lacked with me that now you ask to go to your own country?” He replied, “Nothing; nevertheless you must let me go.”
1KI.11.23	God also stirred up 
1KI.11.24	Rezon gathered men to himself and became leader of a marauding band, after David killed those 
1KI.11.25	So Rezon was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, along with the evil that Hadad 
1KI.11.26	Jeroboam, Solomon’s servant, the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zeredah whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, also rebelled against the king. 
1KI.11.27	Now this is the reason why he rebelled against the king: Solomon built the Millo (fortification) and he repaired 
1KI.11.28	The man Jeroboam was a brave warrior and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious, he put him in charge of all the forced labor of the house of Joseph. 
1KI.11.29	It came about at that time, when Jeroboam left Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met him on the road. Now Ahijah had covered himself with a new cloak; and the two of them were alone in the field. 
1KI.11.30	Then Ahijah took hold of the new cloak which he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces. 
1KI.11.31	He said to Jeroboam, “Take ten pieces for yourself; for thus says the L
1KI.11.32	but he [and his descendants] shall have 
1KI.11.33	because 
1KI.11.34	However, I will not take the entire kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of My servant David, whom I chose because he kept My commandments and My statutes. 
1KI.11.35	But I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand and give it to you: ten tribes. 
1KI.11.36	Yet to his son I will give 
1KI.11.37	I will take you [Jeroboam], and you shall reign over whatever your soul desires; and you shall be king over Israel (the ten northern tribes). 
1KI.11.38	Then it shall be, that if you listen to all that I command you and walk in My ways, and do what is right in My sight, keeping 
1KI.11.39	And in this way I will afflict the descendants of David for this (their sin), but not forever.’ ” 
1KI.11.40	So Solomon attempted to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam set out and escaped to Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and stayed in Egypt until Solomon died.
1KI.11.41	The rest of the acts of Solomon—and all that he did, and his wisdom—are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon? 
1KI.11.42	The time Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years. 
1KI.11.43	And Solomon slept [in death] with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David. Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.
1KI.12.1	Rehoboam went to 
1KI.12.2	Now when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard about it, he was living in Egypt (for he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon). 
1KI.12.3	So they sent 
1KI.12.4	“Your father made our yoke (burden) heavy; so now lighten the hard labor and the heavy yoke your father imposed on us, and we will serve you.” 
1KI.12.5	Rehoboam replied to them, “Leave for three days, then come back to me [for my decision].” So the people left.
1KI.12.6	King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served 
1KI.12.7	They spoke to him, saying, “If you will be a servant to this people today, and will serve them and grant their request, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.” 
1KI.12.8	But he 
1KI.12.9	He said to them, “What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, ‘Lighten the yoke (burden) which your father put on us’?” 
1KI.12.10	The young men who had grown up with him answered, “This is what you should say to this people who told you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but as for you, make our yoke lighter’—say this to them: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins [and my reign will be even more severe]. 
1KI.12.11	And now, whereas my father loaded you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with 
1KI.12.12	Jeroboam and all the people came back to Rehoboam on the third day, just as the king had instructed, saying, “Return to me on the third day.” 
1KI.12.13	The king answered the people harshly and 
1KI.12.14	and spoke to them in accordance with the advice of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but as for me, I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.” 
1KI.12.15	So the king did not listen to the people; for the situation was from the L
1KI.12.16	So when all [the ten northern tribes of] Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people replied to the king, saying,
1KI.12.16	“What portion do we have in David?
1KI.12.16	To your tents, O Israel!
1KI.12.16	Look now after 
1KI.12.16	Then Israel went back to their tents. 
1KI.12.17	But as for the sons (descendants) of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah [including Benjamin], Rehoboam reigned over them. 
1KI.12.18	Then King Rehoboam sent 
1KI.12.19	So Israel (the ten northern tribes) has rebelled against the house (royal line) of David to this day (the date of this writing).
1KI.12.20	It came about when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, that they sent 
1KI.12.21	Now when Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he assembled all the [fighting men from the] house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, 180,000 chosen warriors, to fight against the house of Israel to bring the kingdom back to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. 
1KI.12.22	But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying, 
1KI.12.23	“Tell Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and all the house (fighting men) of Judah and Benjamin and the rest of the people, 
1KI.12.24	‘Thus says the L
1KI.12.25	Then Jeroboam built Shechem [as his royal city] in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. He went out from there and rebuilt Penuel [as a stronghold]. 
1KI.12.26	Jeroboam [doubted God’s promise to him and] said in his heart, “Now the kingdom will return to the house of David. 
1KI.12.27	If these people go up to the house of the L
1KI.12.28	So the king took counsel [and followed bad advice] and made two 
1KI.12.29	He set the one [golden calf] in Bethel, and the other he put in 
1KI.12.30	Now this thing became a sin [for Israel]; because the people went 
1KI.12.31	And Jeroboam also made houses on high places, and he made priests from 
1KI.12.32	Jeroboam held a feast on the fifteenth day of the 
1KI.12.33	So he went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, in the month which he had devised in his own heart [in defiance of God’s commandments]; and he held a feast for the Israelites and he went up to the altar to burn 
1KI.13.1	Now behold, there came a man of God from Judah to Bethel by the word (command) of the L
1KI.13.2	The man cried out against the [idolatrous] altar by the word of the L
1KI.13.3	And he gave a sign the same day, saying, “This is the sign which the L
1KI.13.4	When the king heard the words which the man of God cried out against the altar in Bethel, Jeroboam put out his hand from the altar, saying, “Seize him!” And his hand which he had put out against him withered, so that he was unable to pull it back to himself. 
1KI.13.5	The altar also was split apart and the ashes were poured out from the altar in accordance with the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the L
1KI.13.6	The king answered and said to the man of God, “Please entreat [the favor of] the L
1KI.13.7	And the king said to the man of God, “Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.” 
1KI.13.8	But the man of God said to the king, “
1KI.13.9	For I was commanded by the word of the L
1KI.13.10	So he went another way and did not return by the way that he came to Bethel.
1KI.13.11	Now there was an old prophet living in Bethel; and his sons came and told him everything that the man of God had done that day in Bethel; they also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king. 
1KI.13.12	Their father asked them, “Which way did he go?” For his sons had seen which way the man of God who came from Judah had gone. 
1KI.13.13	He said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled the donkey for him and he rode away on it, 
1KI.13.14	and he went after the man of God. And he found him sitting under an oak (terebinth) tree, and he said to him, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?” And he said, “I am.” 
1KI.13.15	Then he said to him, “Come home with me and eat bread.” 
1KI.13.16	He said, “I cannot return with you nor go in with you, nor will I eat bread or drink water with you in this place. 
1KI.13.17	For I was told by the word of the L
1KI.13.18	He answered him, “I too am a prophet, as you are; and an angel spoke to me by the word of the L
1KI.13.19	So the man of God went back with him, and ate bread in his house and drank water.
1KI.13.20	Now it happened as they were sitting at the table, that the word of the L
1KI.13.21	And he cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, “Thus says the L
1KI.13.22	but have come back and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which the L
1KI.13.23	After the prophet of the house had eaten bread and after he had drunk, he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back. 
1KI.13.24	Now when he had gone, a lion met him by the road and killed him, and his body was thrown in the road, with the donkey standing beside it; the lion was also standing beside the body. 
1KI.13.25	And there were men passing by, and they saw the body thrown in the road, and the lion standing beside the body. So they came and told about it in the city [of Bethel] where the old prophet lived.
1KI.13.26	When the prophet who had brought him back from the road heard about it, he said, “It is the man of God who was disobedient to the word of the L
1KI.13.27	And he said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” And they saddled it. 
1KI.13.28	And he went and found the body thrown on the road, and the donkey and the lion standing beside the body; the lion [miraculously] had not eaten the body or attacked the donkey. 
1KI.13.29	Then the prophet picked up the body of the man of God and laid it on the donkey and brought it back, and he came into the city (Bethel) of the old prophet to mourn and to bury him. 
1KI.13.30	And he laid the body in his own grave, and they mourned over him, saying, “Alas, my brother!” 
1KI.13.31	Then after he had buried him, he said to his sons, “When I am dead, bury me in the grave in which the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones. 
1KI.13.32	For the words which he cried out by the word of the L
1KI.13.33	After this event, Jeroboam [still] did not turn from his evil way, but again made priests for the high places from among all the people. He ordained anyone who was willing, so that there would be priests for the high places. 
1KI.13.34	And this thing (idol worship) became the sin of the house of Jeroboam to blot it out and eliminate it from the face of the earth.
1KI.14.1	At that time Abijah the son [and crown prince, heir] of Jeroboam became sick. 
1KI.14.2	Jeroboam said to his wife, “Please get up and disguise yourself, so that people will not know that you are Jeroboam’s wife, and go to Shiloh. Ahijah the prophet is there, the one who told me that 
1KI.14.3	Take with you ten loaves of bread, 
1KI.14.4	Jeroboam’s wife did so. She got up and went [twenty miles] to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see, because his eyes were dim from old age. 
1KI.14.5	And the L
1KI.14.6	So when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in the doorway, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why do you pretend to be another woman? For I have been sent to you [by God] with a harsh 
1KI.14.7	Go, tell Jeroboam, ‘This is what the L
1KI.14.8	and tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you—but you have not been like My servant David, who kept My commandments and followed Me with all his heart, to do only what was right in My eyes, 
1KI.14.9	but have done more evil than all [the 
1KI.14.10	therefore behold, I am bringing evil on the house (royal line) of Jeroboam, and I will cut off (destroy) from Jeroboam every male, both bond and free, in Israel, and will 
1KI.14.11	The dogs will eat [the carcass of] anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city, and the birds of the sky will eat [the carcass of] anyone who dies in the field, for the L
1KI.14.12	Now as for you (Jeroboam’s wife), arise, go to your own house. When your feet enter the city, the child [Abijah] will die. 
1KI.14.13	All Israel shall mourn for him and bury him, for he alone of Jeroboam’s 
1KI.14.14	Moreover, the L
1KI.14.15	“The L
1KI.14.16	He will give up Israel because of the sins of Jeroboam which he has committed, and with which he has made Israel sin [by leading them into idolatry].”
1KI.14.17	So Jeroboam’s wife arose and left and came to Tirzah [the king’s residence]. As she was entering the threshold of the house, the child [Abijah] died. 
1KI.14.18	And all Israel buried him and mourned for him, in accordance with the word of the L
1KI.14.19	Now as for the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he made war and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 
1KI.14.20	The time that Jeroboam reigned was twenty-two years, and he slept with his fathers [in death]; and Nadab his son reigned in his place.
1KI.14.21	Now Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the L
1KI.14.22	And [the people of] Judah did evil in the sight of the L
1KI.14.23	For they also built for themselves high places [to worship idols] and 
1KI.14.24	There were also male cult prostitutes in the land. They committed all the repulsive acts of the nations which the L
1KI.14.25	Now in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt [Jeroboam’s brother-in-law] came up against Jerusalem. 
1KI.14.26	He took away the treasures of the house (temple) of the L
1KI.14.27	So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and handed them over to the captains of the palace guard who guarded the doorway of the king’s house. 
1KI.14.28	And as often as the king went into the house of the L
1KI.14.29	Now as for the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and everything that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
1KI.14.30	There was also war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. 
1KI.14.31	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers [in death] and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess. Abijam (Abijah) his son became king in his place.
1KI.15.1	In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Abijam became king over Judah. 
1KI.15.2	He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother was Maacah [grand]daughter of Abishalom (
1KI.15.3	He walked in all the sins [of idol worship] that his father [Rehoboam] committed before him; and his heart was not entirely devoted to the L
1KI.15.4	Nevertheless, for David’s sake the L
1KI.15.5	because David did what was right in the eyes of the L
1KI.15.6	There was war between Rehoboam [Abijam’s father] and Jeroboam all the days of Rehoboam’s life.
1KI.15.7	Now as for the rest of the acts of Abijam and everything that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
1KI.15.8	Abijam slept with his fathers [in death] and they buried him in the City of David. Asa his son became king in his place.
1KI.15.9	So in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa began to reign as king over Judah. 
1KI.15.10	He reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. His [great-grand]mother was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom (Absalom). 
1KI.15.11	Asa did what was right in the eyes of the L
1KI.15.12	He expelled the male cult prostitutes (sodomites) from the land and removed all the idols that his fathers [Solomon, Rehoboam, and Abijam] had made. 
1KI.15.13	He also deposed his [great-grand]mother Maacah from 
1KI.15.14	But the high places [of idol worship] were not removed. Nevertheless, Asa’s heart was entirely devoted to the L
1KI.15.15	He brought the things which his father had dedicated and the things which he had dedicated into the house of the L
1KI.15.16	Now there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. 
1KI.15.17	Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah [north of Jerusalem], in order to prevent 
1KI.15.18	Then Asa took all the silver and gold left in the treasuries of the house of the L
1KI.15.19	“
1KI.15.20	So Ben-hadad listened to king Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth [the region of the Sea of Galilee], along with all the land of Naphtali. 
1KI.15.21	When Baasha heard about it, he stopped 
1KI.15.22	Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah—none was exempt—and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber with which Baasha had built [the fortifications]. And King Asa built with them [border fortresses at] Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah.
1KI.15.23	Now as for the rest of all the acts of Asa, all his might, everything that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? But during the time of his old age he had a foot disease. 
1KI.15.24	Asa slept with his fathers [in death] and was buried with his fathers in the city of his father David. Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place.
1KI.15.25	Now Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel for two years. 
1KI.15.26	He did evil in the sight of the L
1KI.15.27	Baasha the son of Ahijah of the house (tribe) of Issachar conspired against Nadab, and Baasha struck him down at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, while Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.
1KI.15.28	So Baasha killed Nadab in the third year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place. 
1KI.15.29	As soon as he was king, Baasha struck down all the household of Jeroboam. He did not leave for Jeroboam anyone alive, but he destroyed them in accordance with the word of the L
1KI.15.30	because of the sins committed by Jeroboam and which he made Israel commit, and because he provoked the L
1KI.15.31	Now as for the rest of Nadab’s acts and everything that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
1KI.15.32	There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
1KI.15.33	In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah became king over all Israel in Tirzah [the capital city], 
1KI.15.34	He did evil in the sight of the L
1KI.16.1	Now the word of the L
1KI.16.2	“Because I exalted you [Baasha] from the dust and made you leader over My people Israel, and you walked in the way of Jeroboam and made My people Israel sin, provoking Me to anger with their sins [of idol worship], 
1KI.16.3	behold, I am going to sweep away Baasha and his household (family), and I will make your house (royal line) like that of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 
1KI.16.4	The dogs will eat anyone belonging to Baasha who dies in the city, and the birds of the sky will eat anyone belonging to him who dies in the field.”
1KI.16.5	Now as for the rest of the acts of Baasha, what he did and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
1KI.16.6	Baasha slept with his fathers [in death] and was buried in Tirzah. Elah his son became king in his place. 
1KI.16.7	Moreover, the word of the L
1KI.16.8	In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha became king over Israel in Tirzah, 
1KI.16.9	His servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against Elah. Now Elah was in Tirzah, getting drunk in the house of Arza, who was in charge of the [king’s] household in Tirzah. 
1KI.16.10	Then Zimri came in and struck and killed Elah in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and became king in his place. 
1KI.16.11	When he became king, as soon as he sat on his throne, he killed the entire household of Baasha; he did not leave a single male [alive], either of his 
1KI.16.12	Thus Zimri destroyed the entire household of Baasha, in accordance with the word of the L
1KI.16.13	for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son, which they committed, and made Israel commit, provoking the L
1KI.16.14	Now as for the rest of the acts of Elah and everything that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
1KI.16.15	In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned [over Israel] for seven days at Tirzah. Now the troops were camped against Gibbethon, [a city] which belonged to the Philistines, 
1KI.16.16	and the people who were camped heard it said, “Zimri has conspired and has also struck down the king.” So all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp. 
1KI.16.17	Then Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah. 
1KI.16.18	When Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the fortress of the king’s palace; and 
1KI.16.19	because of the sins he had committed, doing evil in the sight of the L
1KI.16.20	Now as for the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his [treasonous] conspiracy which he committed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
1KI.16.21	Then the people of Israel were divided in half. Half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king, and the 
1KI.16.22	But the people who followed Omri prevailed over the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath. So Tibni died and Omri became king. 
1KI.16.23	In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri became king over Israel 
1KI.16.24	Omri bought the hill Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver, and he built 
1KI.16.25	But Omri did evil in the sight of the L
1KI.16.26	He walked in all the ways of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and in his sin, which he made Israel commit, provoking the L
1KI.16.27	Now as for the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might which he showed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
1KI.16.28	So Omri slept with his fathers [in death] and was buried in Samaria. Ahab his son became king in his place.
1KI.16.29	Ahab the son of Omri became king over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria for twenty-two years. 
1KI.16.30	Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the L
1KI.16.31	It came about, as if it had been a trivial thing for Ahab to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he married 
1KI.16.32	So he erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal which he built in Samaria. 
1KI.16.33	Ahab also made the Asherah. Ahab did more to provoke the L
1KI.16.34	In his days, Hiel the Bethelite rebuilt Jericho. He laid its foundations with the 
1KI.17.1	Now Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the settlers of Gilead, said to Ahab, “As the L
1KI.17.2	And the word of the L
1KI.17.3	“Go from here and turn eastward and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, which is east of the Jordan [River]. 
1KI.17.4	You shall drink from the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to sustain you there [with food].” 
1KI.17.5	So he went and did in accordance with the word of the L
1KI.17.6	And the ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening; and he would drink from the brook. 
1KI.17.7	It happened after a while that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.
1KI.17.8	Then the word of the L

1KI.17.10	So he set out and went to Zarephath, and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks [for firewood]. He called out to her and said, “Please bring me a little water in a jar, so that I may drink.” 
1KI.17.11	As she was going to get it, he called to her and said, “Please bring me a piece of bread in your hand.” 
1KI.17.12	But she said, “As the L
1KI.17.13	Elijah said to her, “Do not fear; go and do as you have said. Just make me a little bread from it first and bring it out to me, and afterward you may make one for yourself and for your son. 
1KI.17.14	For this is what the L
1KI.17.15	She went and did as Elijah said. And she and he and her household ate for 
1KI.17.16	The bowl of flour was not exhausted nor did the jar of oil become empty, in accordance with the word of the L
1KI.17.17	It happened after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became sick; and his illness was so severe that there was no breath left in him. 
1KI.17.18	So she said to Elijah, “What [problem] is there between you and me, O man of God? Have you come to me to bring my sin to mind and to put my son to death?” 
1KI.17.19	He said to her, “Give me your son.” Then he took him from her arms and carried him up to the upper room where he was living, and laid him on his own bed. 
1KI.17.20	He called to the L
1KI.17.21	Then he stretched himself out upon the child three times, and called to the L
1KI.17.22	The L
1KI.17.23	Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper room into the [lower part of the] house and gave him to his mother; and Elijah said, “See, your son is alive.” 
1KI.17.24	Then the woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the L
1KI.18.1	Now it happened after many days that the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year, saying, “Go, show yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the face of the earth.” 
1KI.18.2	So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria. 
1KI.18.3	Ahab called Obadiah who was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the L
1KI.18.4	for when Jezebel destroyed the prophets of the L
1KI.18.5	Then Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go into the land to all the sources of water and to all the streams; perhaps we may find grass and keep the horses and mules alive, and not have to kill some of the cattle.” 
1KI.18.6	So they divided the land between them to 
1KI.18.7	As Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him. He recognized him and fell face downward [out of respect] and said, “Is it you, my lord Elijah?” 
1KI.18.8	He answered him, “It is I. Go tell your master, ‘Elijah is here.’ ” 
1KI.18.9	But he said, “What sin have I committed, that you would hand over your servant to Ahab to put me to death? 
1KI.18.10	As the L
1KI.18.11	And now you are saying, ‘Go, tell your master, “Behold, Elijah [is here].” ’ 
1KI.18.12	And as soon as I leave you, the Spirit of the L
1KI.18.13	Has it not been told to my lord [Elijah] what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the L
1KI.18.14	And now you are saying, ‘Go, tell your master, “Elijah is here” ’; and he will kill me.” 
1KI.18.15	Elijah said, “As the L
1KI.18.16	So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
1KI.18.17	When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, “Are you the one who is bringing disaster on Israel?” 
1KI.18.18	Elijah said, “I have not brought disaster on Israel, but you and your father’s household 
1KI.18.19	Now then, send 
1KI.18.20	So Ahab sent 
1KI.18.21	Elijah approached all the people and said, “How long will you 
1KI.18.22	Then Elijah said to the people, “I alone remain a prophet of the L
1KI.18.23	Now let them give us two oxen, and let them choose one ox for themselves and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire 
1KI.18.24	Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the L
1KI.18.25	Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose one bull for yourselves and prepare it first, since there are many of you; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire 
1KI.18.26	So they took the bull that was given to them and prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, “O Baal, hear 
1KI.18.27	At noon Elijah mocked them, saying, “Cry out with a loud voice, for he is a god; either he is occupied, or he is out [at the moment], or he is on a journey. Perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened!” 
1KI.18.28	So they cried out with a loud voice [to get Baal’s attention] and cut themselves with swords and lances in accordance with their custom, until the blood flowed out on them. 
1KI.18.29	As midday passed, they played the part of prophets 
1KI.18.30	Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me.” So all the people approached him. And he repaired 
1KI.18.31	Then Elijah took twelve stones in accordance with the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the L
1KI.18.32	So with the stones Elijah built an altar in the name of the L
1KI.18.33	Then he laid out the wood and cut the ox in pieces and laid it on the wood. 
1KI.18.34	And he said, “Fill four pitchers with water and pour it on the burnt offering and the wood.” And he said, “Do it the second time.” And they did it the second time. And he said, “Do it the third time.” And they did it a third time. 
1KI.18.35	The water flowed around the altar, and he also filled the trench with water.
1KI.18.36	At the time of the offering of the

1KI.18.38	Then the fire of the L
1KI.18.39	When all the people saw it, they fell face downward; and they said, “The L
1KI.18.40	Then Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal; do not let one of them escape.” They seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and [as God’s law required] killed them there.
1KI.18.41	Now Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink, for there is the sound of the roar 
1KI.18.42	So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he crouched down to the earth and put his face between his knees, 
1KI.18.43	and he said to his servant, “Go up, look toward the sea.” So he went up and looked and said, “There is nothing.” Elijah said, “Go back” seven times. 
1KI.18.44	And at the seventh 
1KI.18.45	In a little while the sky grew dark with clouds and wind, and there were heavy showers. And Ahab mounted 
1KI.18.46	Then the hand of the L
1KI.19.1	Now Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets [of Baal] with the sword. 
1KI.19.2	Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “So may the gods do to me, and even more, if by this time tomorrow I do not make your 
1KI.19.3	And Elijah was afraid and arose and ran for his life, and he came to 
1KI.19.4	But he himself traveled a day’s journey into the wilderness, and he came and sat down under a juniper tree and asked [God] that he might die. He said, “It is enough; now, O L
1KI.19.5	He lay down and slept under the juniper tree, and behold, an angel touched him and said to him, “Get up and eat.” 
1KI.19.6	He looked, and by his head there was a bread cake baked on hot coal, and a pitcher of water. So he ate and drank and lay down again. 
1KI.19.7	Then the angel of the L
1KI.19.8	So he got up and ate and drank, and with the strength of that food he traveled forty days and nights to Horeb (Sinai), the mountain of God.
1KI.19.9	There he came to a cave and spent the night in it; and behold, the word of the L
1KI.19.10	He said, “I have been very

1KI.19.12	After the earthquake, [there was] a fire, but the L
1KI.19.13	When Elijah heard 
1KI.19.14	He said, “I have been very zealous for the L
1KI.19.15	The L
1KI.19.16	and you shall anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi as king over Israel; and anoint Elisha the son of Shaphat of

1KI.19.18	Yet I will leave 7,000 [survivors] in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed down to Baal and every mouth that has not kissed him.”
1KI.19.19	So Elijah departed from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, while he was plowing with twelve pairs 
1KI.19.20	He left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said, “Please let me kiss my father and mother [goodbye], then I will follow you.” And he said to him, “Go on back; for what have I done to [stop] you?” 
1KI.19.21	So Elisha left him and went back. Then he took a pair of oxen and sacrificed them and boiled their meat with the implements of the oxen [as fuel], and gave 
1KI.20.1	Ben-hadad king of Aram (Syria) gathered all his army together; thirty-two kings were [allied] with him, with horses and chariots. And he went up and besieged Samaria [Israel’s capital], and fought against it. 
1KI.20.2	Then he sent messengers to the city to Ahab king of Israel; and he said to him, “Thus says Ben-hadad: 
1KI.20.3	‘Your silver and your gold are mine; your wives and your children, even the fairest, also are mine [as conditions of peace].’ ” 
1KI.20.4	The king of Israel [conceded his defeat and] answered, “By your word, my lord, O king, I am yours, and all that I have.” 
1KI.20.5	The messengers returned and said, “Thus says Ben-hadad: ‘I indeed sent 
1KI.20.6	but about this time tomorrow I will send my servants to you, and they will search your house and the houses of your servants; and they will take with their hands (confiscate) whatever is desirable in your eyes and carry it away.’ ”
1KI.20.7	Then the king of Israel summoned all the elders of the land and said, “Please observe and see how this man is seeking our destruction. For he sent 
1KI.20.8	All the elders and all the people said to him, “Do not listen or consent [to this additional demand].” 
1KI.20.9	So he said to Ben-hadad’s messengers, “Tell my lord the king, ‘Every

1KI.20.11	The king of Israel answered, “Tell him, ‘A man who puts on [his armor to go to battle] should not boast like the man who takes it off [after the battle has been won].’ ” 
1KI.20.12	When Ben-hadad heard this message, as he and the kings were drinking in the temporary shelters, he said to his servants, “Station 
1KI.20.13	Then a prophet approached Ahab king of Israel and said, “Thus says the L
1KI.20.14	Ahab said, “By whom?” And he said, “Thus says the L
1KI.20.15	Then Ahab assembled 
1KI.20.16	They went out at noon, while Ben-hadad was getting drunk in the temporary shelters, he and the thirty-two kings who were helping him. 
1KI.20.17	The young men of the governors of the districts went out first; and Ben-hadad sent 
1KI.20.18	And he said, “Whether they have come out for peace or for war, take them alive.”
1KI.20.19	So these young men of the governors of the districts went out of the city, and the army followed them. 
1KI.20.20	And each one killed his man; and the Arameans (Syrians) fled and Israel pursued them. Ben-hadad king of Aram escaped on a horse with horsemen. 
1KI.20.21	The king of Israel went out and struck [the riders of] the horses and chariots, and killed the Arameans in a great slaughter.
1KI.20.22	Then the prophet approached the king of Israel and said to him, “Go, strengthen yourself and observe and see what you have to do; for at the first of next year the king of Aram (Syria) will come up against you.”
1KI.20.23	Now the servants of the king of Aram said to him, “Israel’s 
1KI.20.24	Do this: remove the [thirty-two allied] kings, each from his place, and put captains in their place, 
1KI.20.25	and assemble an army like the army that you have lost 
1KI.20.26	At the first of the year [in spring], Ben-hadad assembled 
1KI.20.27	The sons of Israel were counted and given provisions, and they went to meet them. The Israelites camped before the enemy like two 
1KI.20.28	A man of God approached and said to the king of Israel, “Thus says the L
1KI.20.29	So they camped opposite each other for seven days. Then on the seventh day the battle began, and the sons of Israel killed 100,000 of the Aramean foot soldiers in a single day. 
1KI.20.30	But the rest ran to the city of Aphek, and the [city] wall fell on 27,000 of the men who were left. Ben-hadad escaped and came into the city, going into an inner chamber [to hide].
1KI.20.31	But his servants said to him, “We have heard that the kings of the house (royal line) of Israel are merciful kings. Please let us put sackcloth around our 
1KI.20.32	So they put sackcloth around their loins and ropes on their necks, and came to the king of Israel and said, “Your servant Ben-hadad says, ‘Please let me live.’ ” And Ahab asked, “Is he still alive? He is my brother.” 
1KI.20.33	Now the men took it as a 
1KI.20.34	Ben-hadad [tempting him] said to him, “I will restore the cities which my father took from your father; and you may set up bazaars (shops) of your own in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.” Then, 
1KI.20.35	Now a certain man of

1KI.20.37	Then the prophet found another man and said, “Please strike me.” So the man struck him hard, wounding him. 
1KI.20.38	So the prophet left and waited for King Ahab by the road, and disguised himself [as a wounded soldier] with a bandage over his eyes. 
1KI.20.39	As the king passed by, the prophet called out to the king and said, “Your servant went out into the middle of the battle, and behold, a man turned aside and brought a man to me and said, ‘Guard this man; if for any reason he is missing, then your life shall be 
1KI.20.40	But while your servant was busy here and there, he [escaped and] was gone.” And the king of Israel said to him, “Such is your own judgment (verdict); you have determined it.” 
1KI.20.41	Then the prophet quickly removed the bandage from his eyes, and [Ahab] the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets. 
1KI.20.42	He said to the king, “Thus says the L
1KI.20.43	So the king of Israel went to his house resentful and sullen, and came to Samaria.
1KI.21.1	Now it came about after these things that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel, close beside the [winter] palace of Ahab king of Samaria; 
1KI.21.2	Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, “Give me your vineyard, so that I may have it for a garden of vegetables 
1KI.21.3	But Naboth said to Ahab, “The L
1KI.21.4	So Ahab [already upset by the Lord’s message] came into his house [feeling more] resentful and sullen because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had said to him; for he had said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” And he lay down on his bed and turned away his face, and would not eat any food.
1KI.21.5	Then Jezebel his wife came to him and asked him, “Why is your spirit so troubled that you have not eaten?” 
1KI.21.6	And he said to her, “Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him, ‘Give me your vineyard for money; or if you prefer, I will give you 
1KI.21.7	Jezebel his wife said to him, “Do you now reign over Israel? Get up, eat food, and let your heart rejoice; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”
1KI.21.8	So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name and sealed them with his seal, and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived with Naboth in his city. 
1KI.21.9	Now in the letters she wrote, “Proclaim a 
1KI.21.10	and seat two worthless 
1KI.21.11	So the men of his city, the elders and the nobles who lived there, did as Jezebel had sent 
1KI.21.12	They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth at the head of the people. 
1KI.21.13	Two worthless 
1KI.21.14	Then they sent 
1KI.21.15	When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, she said to Ahab, “Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite which he refused to sell you, because Naboth is no longer alive, but dead.” 
1KI.21.16	When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
1KI.21.17	Then the word of the L
1KI.21.18	“Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria. Behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession of it. 
1KI.21.19	You shall speak to him, saying, ‘Thus says the L
1KI.21.20	Ahab said to Elijah, “Have you found me, O my enemy?” And he answered, “I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the L

1KI.21.22	and I will make your house (descendants) like that of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for provoking Me to anger and making Israel sin.

1KI.21.25	There certainly was no one like Ahab who sold himself to do evil in the sight of the L
1KI.21.26	He acted very repulsively in following idols, in accordance with everything the Amorites had done, whom the L
1KI.21.27	Now when Ahab heard these words [of Elijah], he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and fasted, and he lay in sackcloth and went about dejectedly (mourning). 
1KI.21.28	Then the word of the L
1KI.21.29	“Do you see how Ahab has humbled himself before Me? Because he has humbled himself before Me, I will not bring the evil (catastrophe) in his lifetime, but in his son’s days I will bring evil upon his house.”
1KI.22.1	Aram (Syria) and Israel continued without war for three years. 
1KI.22.2	In the third year Jehoshaphat king of Judah came down to the 
1KI.22.3	Now the king of Israel said to his servants, “Do you know that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, yet we are still doing nothing to take it from the hand of the king of Aram?” 
1KI.22.4	And Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead?” Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”
1KI.22.5	But Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire first for the word of the L
1KI.22.6	Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall I go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or should I not?” And they said, “Go up, for the L
1KI.22.7	But Jehoshaphat [doubted and] said, “Is there not another prophet of the L
1KI.22.8	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is one more man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the L
1KI.22.9	Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, “Bring quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.” 
1KI.22.10	Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were each sitting on his throne, dressed in 
1KI.22.11	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron and said, “Thus says the L
1KI.22.12	All the prophets were prophesying in the same way [to please Ahab], saying, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and be successful, for the L
1KI.22.13	Then the messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him, “
1KI.22.14	But Micaiah said, “As the L
1KI.22.15	So when he came to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go against Ramoth-gilead in battle, or shall we not?” And he answered him, “Go up and be successful, for the L
1KI.22.16	But the king [doubted him and] said to him, “How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the L
1KI.22.17	And he said,
1KI.22.17	“I saw all Israel
1KI.22.17	Scattered upon the mountains,
1KI.22.17	Like sheep that have no shepherd.
1KI.22.17	And the L
1KI.22.17	‘These have no master.
1KI.22.17	Let each of them return to his house in peace.’ ”
1KI.22.18	Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?”
1KI.22.19	Micaiah said, “Therefore, hear the word of the L
1KI.22.20	The L
1KI.22.21	Then a spirit came forward and stood before the L
1KI.22.22	The L

1KI.22.25	Micaiah said, “Behold, you shall see on that day [of the king’s defeat] when you enter an inner room [looking for a place] to hide yourself.” 
1KI.22.26	Then the king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the king’s son, 
1KI.22.27	and say, ‘Thus says the king, “Put this man in prison, and feed him sparingly with the bread and water until I return safely.” ’ ” 
1KI.22.28	Micaiah said, “If you indeed return safely, the L
1KI.22.29	So [Ahab] the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. 
1KI.22.30	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and enter the battle, but you put on your [royal] clothing.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into the battle. 
1KI.22.31	Now the king of Aram (Syria) had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, “Do not fight with [anyone, either] small or great, but with [Ahab] the king of Israel alone.” 
1KI.22.32	When the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “Surely it is the king of Israel.” They turned to fight against him, and Jehoshaphat shouted out [in fear]. 
1KI.22.33	When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.
1KI.22.34	But one man drew a bow at 
1KI.22.35	The battle raged that day, and [Ahab] the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans (Syrians). And in the evening he died, and the blood from his wound ran down into the bottom of the chariot. 
1KI.22.36	Then about sundown a resounding cry passed throughout the army, saying, “Every man to his city and every man to his own country!”
1KI.22.37	So the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried the king in Samaria. 
1KI.22.38	They washed the chariot by the pool [on the outskirts] of Samaria, where the prostitutes bathed, and the dogs licked up his blood, in accordance with the word of the L
1KI.22.39	Now the rest of Ahab’s acts, and everything that he did, the ivory palace which he built and all the cities which he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
1KI.22.40	So Ahab slept with his fathers [in death], and Ahaziah his son became king in his place.
1KI.22.41	Now Jehoshaphat the son of Asa became king over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. 
1KI.22.42	Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 
1KI.22.43	He walked in all the ways of Asa his father, without turning from them, doing right in the sight of the L
1KI.22.44	Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel.
1KI.22.45	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, his might which he displayed and how he made war, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
1KI.22.46	And the remnant of the sodomites (male cult prostitutes) who remained in the days of his father Asa, Jehoshaphat expelled from the land.
1KI.22.47	Now there was no king in Edom; a deputy (governor) was [serving as] king. 
1KI.22.48	Jehoshaphat had [large cargo] ships of Tarshish constructed to go to Ophir for gold, but they did not go, because the ships were wrecked at Ezion-geber. 
1KI.22.49	Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my servants go with your servants in the ships,” But Jehoshaphat was unwilling 
1KI.22.50	Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers [in death] and was buried with his fathers in the city of his father David, and Jehoram his son became king in his place.
1KI.22.51	Ahaziah the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel for two years. 
1KI.22.52	He did evil in the sight of the L
1KI.22.53	He served Baal and worshiped him, and he provoked the L
2KI.1.1	Now Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab. 
2KI.1.2	Ahaziah [the king of Israel] fell through the lattice (grid) in his upper chamber which was in Samaria, and became sick [from the injury]. So he sent messengers, saying to them, “Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of

2KI.1.5	When the messengers returned to Ahaziah, he said to them, “Why have you returned [so soon]?” 
2KI.1.6	They replied, “A man came up to meet us and said to us, ‘Go, return to the king who sent you and tell him, “Thus says the L
2KI.1.7	The king asked them, “What was the appearance of the man who came up to meet you and said these things to you?” 
2KI.1.8	They answered him, “
2KI.1.9	Then the king sent to Elijah a captain of fifty with his fifty [fighting men to seize the prophet]. And he went up to him, and behold, he was sitting on the top of a hill. And the captain said to him, “Man of God, the king says, ‘Come down.’ ” 
2KI.1.10	Elijah replied to the captain of fifty, “So if I am a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty [fighting men].” Then fire fell from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.
2KI.1.11	So King Ahaziah again sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty [fighting men]. And he said to him, “Man of God, thus says the king, ‘Come down quickly.’ ” 
2KI.1.12	Elijah answered them, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty [fighting men].” And the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.
2KI.1.13	So Ahaziah again sent a captain of a third fifty with his fifty [fighting men]. And the third captain of fifty went up and came bowed down on his knees before Elijah, and begged him [for compassion] and said to him, “O man of God, please let my life and the lives of your servants, these fifty, be precious in your sight. 
2KI.1.14	Behold, fire came down from heaven and consumed the first two captains of fifty with their fifties; but now let my life be precious in your sight.” 
2KI.1.15	The angel of the L
2KI.1.16	Then Elijah said to Ahaziah, “Thus says the L
2KI.1.17	So Ahaziah [the son of King Ahab] died in accordance with the word of the L
2KI.1.18	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2KI.2.1	When the L

2KI.2.4	Elijah said to him, “Elisha, please stay here, for the L
2KI.2.5	The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho approached Elisha and said to him, “Do you know that the L
2KI.2.6	Elijah said to him, “Please stay here, for the L
2KI.2.7	Fifty men of the sons of the prophets also went and stood opposite them [to watch] at a distance; and the two of them stood by the Jordan. 
2KI.2.8	And Elijah took his mantle (coat) and rolled it up and struck the waters, and they were divided this way and that, so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground.
2KI.2.9	And when they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for you before I am taken from you.” And Elisha said, “Please let a double 
2KI.2.10	He said, “You have asked for a difficult thing. 
2KI.2.11	As they continued along and talked, behold, a chariot of fire with horses of fire [appeared suddenly and] separated the two of them, and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind. 
2KI.2.12	Elisha saw it and cried out, “My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen!” And he no longer saw Elijah. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them into two pieces [in grief]. 
2KI.2.13	He picked up the mantle of Elijah that fell off him, and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan. 
2KI.2.14	He took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and struck the waters and said, “Where is the L
2KI.2.15	When the sons of the prophets who were [watching] opposite at Jericho saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” And they came to meet him and bowed down to the ground before him [in respect]. 
2KI.2.16	Then they said to Elisha, “Behold now, there are among your servants fifty strong men; please let them go and search for your master. It may be that the Spirit of the L
2KI.2.17	But when they urged him until he was embarrassed [to refuse them], he said, “Send 
2KI.2.18	They returned to Elisha while he was staying at Jericho; and he said to them, “Did I not tell you, ‘Do not go’?”
2KI.2.19	Then the men of the city said to Elisha, “Look, this city is in a pleasant place, as my lord [Elisha] sees; but the water is bad and the land 
2KI.2.20	He said, “Bring me a new jar, and put 
2KI.2.21	Then Elisha went to the spring of water and threw the salt in it and said, “Thus says the L
2KI.2.22	So the waters have been purified to this day, in accordance with the word spoken by Elisha.
2KI.2.23	Then Elisha went up from Jericho to 
2KI.2.24	When he turned around and looked at them, he cursed them in the name of the L
2KI.2.25	Elisha went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.
2KI.3.1	Jehoram the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the 
2KI.3.2	He did evil in the sight of the L
2KI.3.3	Nevertheless, he continued in the [idolatrous] sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin; he did not depart from them.
2KI.3.5	But when Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. 
2KI.3.6	So King Jehoram left Samaria at that time and assembled all [the fighting men of] Israel. 
2KI.3.7	Then he went and sent 
2KI.3.8	Jehoram said, “Which way shall we go up?” Jehoshaphat answered, “The way through the Wilderness of Edom.”
2KI.3.9	So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. They made a circuit of seven days’ journey, but there was no water for the army or for the cattle that followed them. 
2KI.3.10	Then the king of Israel said, “We are doomed, for the L
2KI.3.11	But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there no prophet of the L
2KI.3.12	Jehoshaphat said, “The word of the L

2KI.3.15	But now bring me a musician.” And it came about while the musician played, that the hand (power) of the L

2KI.3.18	This is but a simple thing in the sight of the L
2KI.3.19	You shall strike every fortified city and every choice (principal) city, and cut down every good tree and stop up all sources of water, and ruin every good piece of land with stones.’ ” 
2KI.3.20	It happened in the morning, when the sacrifice was offered, that suddenly water came [miraculously] from the area of Edom, and the country was filled with water.
2KI.3.21	Now all the Moabites heard that the [three] kings had come up to fight against them, and all 
2KI.3.22	When they got up early the 
2KI.3.23	And they said, “This is blood! Clearly the kings have fought together, and have killed one another. Now then, Moab, to the spoil [and the plunder of the dead soldiers]!” 
2KI.3.24	But when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land, killing the Moabites [as they went]. 
2KI.3.25	They destroyed the [walls of the] cities, and each man threw a stone on every piece of good land, covering it [with stones]. And they stopped up all the springs of water and cut down all the good trees, until they left 
2KI.3.26	When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom; but they could not. 
2KI.3.27	Then the king of Moab took his 
2KI.4.1	Now one of the wives 
2KI.4.2	Elisha said to her, “What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have [of value] in the house?” She said, “Your maidservant has nothing in the house except a [small] jar of [olive] oil.” 
2KI.4.3	Then he said, “Go, borrow containers from all your neighbors, empty containers—and not 
2KI.4.4	Then you shall go in and shut the door behind you and your sons, and pour out [the oil you have] into all these containers, and you shall set aside each one when it is full.” 
2KI.4.5	So she left him and shut the door behind her and her sons; they were bringing her 
2KI.4.6	When the containers were all full, she said to her son, “Bring me another container.” And he said to her, “There is not a one left.” Then the oil stopped [multiplying]. 
2KI.4.7	Then she came and told the man of God. He said, “Go, sell the oil and pay your debt, and you and your sons can live on the rest.”
2KI.4.8	Now there came a day when Elisha went over to Shunem, where there was a prominent 
2KI.4.9	She said to her husband, “Behold, I sense that this is a holy man of God who frequently passes our way. 
2KI.4.10	Please, let us make a small, fully-walled upper room [on the housetop] and put a bed there for him, with a table, a chair, and a lampstand. Then whenever he comes to 
2KI.4.11	One day he came there and turned in to the upper room and lay down to rest. 
2KI.4.12	And he said to Gehazi his servant, “Call this Shunammite.” So he called her and she stood before him. 
2KI.4.13	Now he said to Gehazi, “Say to her now, ‘You have gone to all this trouble for us; what can I do for you? Would you 
2KI.4.14	Later Elisha said, “What then is to be done for her?” Gehazi answered, “Well, she has no son and her husband is old.” 
2KI.4.15	He said, “Call her.” So Gehazi called her, and she [came and] stood in the doorway. 
2KI.4.16	Elisha said, “At this season next year, you will embrace a son.” She said, “No, my lord. O man of God, do not lie to your maidservant.”
2KI.4.17	But the woman conceived and gave birth to a son at that season the next year, just as Elisha had said to her.
2KI.4.18	When the child was grown, the day came that he went out to his father, to the reapers. 
2KI.4.19	But he said to his father, “My head, my head.” The man said to his servant, “Carry him to his mother.” 
2KI.4.20	When he had carried and brought him to his mother, he sat on her lap until noon, and 
2KI.4.21	She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut 
2KI.4.22	Then she called to her husband and said, “Please send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, so that I may run to the man of God and return.” 
2KI.4.23	He said, “Why are you going to him today? It is neither the New Moon nor the Sabbath.” And she said, “
2KI.4.24	Then she saddled the donkey and said to her servant, “Drive [the animal] fast; do not slow down the pace for me unless I tell you.” 
2KI.4.25	So she set out and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel.
2KI.4.26	Please run now to meet her and ask her, ‘Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?’ ” And she answered, “It is well.” 
2KI.4.27	When she came to the mountain to the man of God, she took hold of his feet. Gehazi approached to push her away; but the man of God said, “Let her alone, for her soul is desperate 
2KI.4.28	Then she said, “Did I ask for a son from my lord? Did I not say, ‘Do not give me false hope’?”
2KI.4.29	Then he said to Gehazi, “
2KI.4.30	The mother of the child said, “As the L
2KI.4.31	Gehazi went on ahead of them and laid the staff on the boy’s face, but there was no sound or response [from the boy]. So he turned back to meet Elisha and told him, “The boy has not awakened (revived).”
2KI.4.32	When Elisha came into the house, the child was dead and lying on his bed. 
2KI.4.33	So he went in, shut the door behind the two of them, and prayed to the L
2KI.4.34	Then he went up and lay on the child and put his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands. And as he stretched himself out on him 
2KI.4.35	Then he returned and walked in the house once back and forth, and went up [again] and stretched himself out on him; and the boy sneezed seven times and he opened his eyes. 
2KI.4.36	Then Elisha called Gehazi and said, “Call this Shunammite.” So he called her. And when she came to him, he said, “Pick up your son.” 
2KI.4.37	She came and fell at his feet, bowing herself to the ground [in respect and gratitude]. Then she picked up her son and left.
2KI.4.38	Elisha came back to Gilgal during a famine in the land. The sons of the prophets were sitting before him, and he said to his servant, “Put on the large pot and cook stew for the sons of the prophets.” 
2KI.4.39	Then one [of them] went into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine and gathered from it a lapful of wild gourds, and came and cut them up into the pot of stew, although they did not know 
2KI.4.40	So they served it for the men to eat. But as they ate the stew, they cried out, “O man of God, there is death in the pot.” And they could not eat it. 
2KI.4.41	But he said, “Bring 
2KI.4.42	Now [at another time] a man from Baal-shalisha came and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley bread, and fresh ears of grain [in the husk] in his sack. And Elisha said, “Give it to the people [affected by the famine] so that they may eat.” 
2KI.4.43	His servant said, “How am I to set [only] this before a hundred [hungry] men?” He said, “Give it to the people so that they may eat, for thus says the L
2KI.4.44	So he set it before them, and they ate and left 
2KI.5.1	Now Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Aram (Syria), was 
2KI.5.2	The Arameans (Syrians) had gone out in bands [as raiders] and had taken captive a little girl from the land of Israel; and she waited on Naaman’s wife [as a servant]. 
2KI.5.3	She said to her mistress, “I wish that my master [Naaman] were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would heal him of his leprosy.” 
2KI.5.4	Naaman went in and told his master [the king], “The girl who is from the land of Israel said such and such.” 
2KI.5.5	Then the king of Aram (Syria) said, “Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel (Jehoram the son of Ahab).” So he left and took with him ten talents of silver and 6,000 
2KI.5.6	And he brought the letter to the king of Israel. It said, “And now when this letter comes to you, I will have sent my servant Naaman to you, so that 
2KI.5.7	When the king of Israel read the letter, he 
2KI.5.8	Now when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent 
2KI.5.9	So Naaman came with his horses and chariots and stopped at the entrance of Elisha’s house. 
2KI.5.10	Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh will be restored to you and 
2KI.5.11	But Naaman was furious and went away and said, “Indeed! I thought ‘He would at least come out to [see] me and stand and call on the name of the L
2KI.5.12	Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus [in Aram], better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage. 
2KI.5.13	Then his servants approached and said to him, “My father, if the prophet had told you 
2KI.5.14	So he went down and plunged himself into the Jordan seven times, just as the man of God had said; and his flesh was restored like that of a little child and he was clean.
2KI.5.15	Then Naaman returned to the man of God, he and all the people in his group, and stood before him. He said, “Behold, I know that there is no God in all the earth, except in Israel; so now accept a blessing 
2KI.5.16	But Elisha said, “As the L
2KI.5.17	Naaman said, “If not, then please, let your servant be given a load of

2KI.5.19	Elisha said to him, “Go in peace.” So Naaman departed and was a good distance away from him,
2KI.5.20	when Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, “My master has spared this Naaman the Aramean (Syrian), by not accepting from him what he brought. As the L
2KI.5.21	So Gehazi pursued Naaman. When Naaman saw someone running after him, he got down from the chariot to meet him and said, “Is all well?” 
2KI.5.22	And he said, “All is well. My master has sent me to say, ‘Just now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a 
2KI.5.23	Naaman said, “Please take two talents.” And he urged him [to accept], and tied up two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of clothes and gave them to two of his servants; and they carried them in front of Gehazi. 
2KI.5.24	When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand and put them in the house [for safekeeping]; and he sent the men away, and they left. 
2KI.5.25	Then he went in and stood before his master. Elisha asked him, “Where have you been, Gehazi?” He said, “Your servant went nowhere.”
2KI.5.26	Elisha said to him, “Did my heart not go 
2KI.5.27	Therefore, the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and to your descendants forever.” So Gehazi departed from his presence, a leper 
2KI.6.1	Now the 
2KI.6.2	Please let us go to the Jordan [River] and let each man take from there a beam [for the building]; and let us make a place there for ourselves where we may live.” And he answered, “Go.” 
2KI.6.3	Then one said, “Please be willing to go with your servants.” So he answered, “I shall go.” 
2KI.6.4	So he went with them; and when they came to the Jordan, they cut down [some of] the trees. 
2KI.6.5	But it happened that as one was cutting down a beam, the axe head fell into the water; and he cried out and said, “Oh no, my master! It was borrowed!” 
2KI.6.6	The man of God said, “Where did it fall?” When he showed him the place, Elisha cut off a stick and threw it in there, and made the iron [axe head] float. 
2KI.6.7	He said, “Pick it up for yourself.” So he reached out with his hand and took it.
2KI.6.8	Now the king of Aram (Syria) was making war against Israel, and he consulted with his servants, saying, “My camp shall be in such and such a place.” 
2KI.6.9	The man of God sent 
2KI.6.10	Then the king of Israel sent 
2KI.6.11	Now the heart of the king of Aram (Syria) was enraged over this thing. He called his servants and said to them, “Will you not tell me which of us is helping the king of Israel?” 
2KI.6.12	One of his servants said, “None [of us is helping him], my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.” 
2KI.6.13	So he said, “Go and see where he is, so that I may send [men] and seize him.” And he was told, “He is in Dothan.” 
2KI.6.14	So he sent horses and chariots and a powerful army there. They came by night and surrounded the city.
2KI.6.15	The servant of the man of God got up early and went out, and behold, there was an army with horses and chariots encircling the city. Elisha’s servant said to him, “Oh no, my master! What are we to do?” 
2KI.6.16	Elisha answered, “Do not be afraid, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.” 
2KI.6.17	Then Elisha prayed and said, “L
2KI.6.18	When the Arameans came down to him, Elisha prayed to the L
2KI.6.19	Then Elisha said to the Arameans, “This is not the way, nor is this the city. Follow me and I will lead you to the man whom you are seeking.” And he led them to Samaria.
2KI.6.20	When they had come into Samaria, Elisha said, “L
2KI.6.21	When the king of Israel (Jehoram) saw them, he said to Elisha, “My father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?” 
2KI.6.22	Elisha answered, “You shall not kill them. Would you kill those you have taken captive with your sword and bow? Serve them bread and water, so that they may eat and drink, and go back to their master [King Ben-hadad].” 
2KI.6.23	So the king prepared a great feast for them; and when they had eaten and drunk he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the marauding bands of Aram did not come into the land of Israel again.
2KI.6.24	But it came about after this, that Ben-hadad king of Aram (Syria) gathered his whole army together and went up and besieged Samaria. 
2KI.6.25	Now there was a great famine in Samaria; and they 
2KI.6.26	As the king of Israel (Jehoram) was passing by on the [city] wall a woman cried out to him, “Help, my lord, O king!” 
2KI.6.27	He said, “If the L
2KI.6.28	And the king said to her, “What is the matter with you?” She answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give your son so we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.’ 
2KI.6.29	So we cooked my son and ate him. The next day I said to her, ‘Give your son so that we may eat him’; but she had hidden her son.” 
2KI.6.30	When the king heard the woman’s words, he 
2KI.6.31	Then he said, “
2KI.6.32	Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. And 
2KI.6.33	While Elisha was still talking with them, the messenger came down to him [followed by the king] and the king said, “This evil [situation] is from the L
2KI.7.1	Then Elisha said, “Hear the word of the L
2KI.7.2	Then the royal officer on whose arm the king leaned answered the man of God and said, “If the L
2KI.7.3	Now four men who were 
2KI.7.4	If we say, ‘We will enter the city’—then the famine is in the city and we will die there; and if we sit still here, we will also die. So now come, let us go over to the camp of the Arameans (Syrians). If they let us live, we will live; and if they kill us, we will only die.” 
2KI.7.5	So they got up at twilight to go to the Aramean camp. But when they came to the edge of the camp, there was no one there. 
2KI.7.6	For the L
2KI.7.7	So the Arameans set out and fled during the twilight, and left their tents, horses, and donkeys, 
2KI.7.8	When these lepers came to the edge of the camp, they went into one tent and ate and drank, and carried away from there silver, gold, and clothing, and went and hid them. Then they went back and entered another tent and carried [some valuable things] from there 
2KI.7.9	Then they said one to another, “We are not doing the right thing. This is a day of good news, yet we are keeping silent. If we wait until the morning light, some punishment [for not reporting this now] will come on us. So now come, let us go and tell the king’s household.” 
2KI.7.10	So they came and called to the gatekeepers of the city. They told them, “We went to the camp of the Arameans (Syrians), and behold, there was no one there, nor the sound of man there—only the horses and donkeys tied up, and the tents [had been left] just as they were.” 
2KI.7.11	Then the gatekeepers called out and it was reported to the king’s household inside [the city]. 
2KI.7.12	Then the king got up in the night and said to his servants, “I will tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know that we are hungry; so they have left the camp to hide themselves in the open country, thinking, ‘When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive and get into the city.’ ” 
2KI.7.13	One of his servants replied, “Please let some 
2KI.7.14	So they took two chariots with horses, and the king sent them after the Aramean army, saying, “Go and see.”
2KI.7.15	They went after them to the Jordan, and all the road was entirely littered with clothing and equipment which the Arameans (Syrians) had thrown away when they hurriedly fled. And the messengers returned and told the king.
2KI.7.16	Then the people [of Israel] went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. So [goods were so plentiful that] a measure of finely-milled flour [was sold] for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in accordance with the word of the L
2KI.7.17	Now the king had appointed the royal officer on whose arm he leaned to be in charge of the [city] gate; and the [starving] people trampled him at the gate [as they struggled to get through for food], and he died, just as the man of God had foretold when the king came down to him. 
2KI.7.18	It happened just as [Elisha] the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, “Two measures of barley will be sold for a shekel and a measure of finely-milled flour for a shekel tomorrow about this time at the gate of Samaria.” 
2KI.7.19	The royal officer had answered the man of God and said, “Now behold, [even] if the L
2KI.7.20	And so it happened to him; for the people trampled him at the gate, and he died.
2KI.8.1	Now Elisha had said to the [Shunammite] woman whose son he had restored to life, “Prepare and go, you and your household, and 
2KI.8.2	So the woman set out and did everything in accordance with the word of the man of God. She and her household went and 
2KI.8.3	At the end of the seven years the woman returned from the land of the Philistines; and she went to appeal to the king [of Israel] for her house and for her land. 
2KI.8.4	Now the king was talking with 
2KI.8.5	And [just] as Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had restored the dead to life, behold, the woman whose son he had restored to life appealed to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, “My lord, O king, this is the woman and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.” 
2KI.8.6	When the king asked the woman, she told him [everything]. So the king appointed for her a certain high official, saying, “Restore everything that was hers, including all the produce of the field since the day that she left the land until now.”
2KI.8.7	Now Elisha came to Damascus, and Ben-hadad king of Aram (Syria) was sick; and he was told, “The man of God has come here.” 
2KI.8.8	And the king said to Hazael, “Take a gift with you and go to meet the man of God, and inquire of the L
2KI.8.9	So Hazael went to meet Elisha and took a gift with him of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ loads; and he came and stood before him and said, “Your son Ben-hadad king of Aram has sent me to you, asking, ‘Will I recover from this illness?’ ” 
2KI.8.10	And Elisha said to him, “Go, say to him, ‘You will certainly recover,’ but the L
2KI.8.11	Elisha stared steadily at Hazael until he was embarrassed, and then the man of God wept. 
2KI.8.12	Hazael said, “Why are you weeping, my lord?” He answered, “Because I know the evil that you will do to the sons (descendants) of Israel. You will set their strongholds on fire, kill their young men with the sword, smash their children to pieces, and rip up their pregnant women.” 
2KI.8.13	Then Hazael said, “
2KI.8.14	Then Hazael departed from Elisha and came to his master, who said to him, “What did Elisha say to you?” And he answered, “He told me you would certainly recover.” 
2KI.8.15	But the next day Hazael took the bedspread and dipped it in water and covered the king’s face, so that he died. And Hazael became king in his place.
2KI.8.16	Now in the fifth year of 
2KI.8.17	He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem. 
2KI.8.18	He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for [Athaliah] the daughter of Ahab became his wife. He did 
2KI.8.19	Yet for the sake of His servant David the L
2KI.8.20	In his days Edom revolted from the rule of Judah, and set up a king over themselves. 
2KI.8.21	So Jehoram [king of Judah] went over to Zair [in Edom] with all his chariots. He set out by night and struck down the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of his chariots; but the people [of his army] fled to their tents. 
2KI.8.22	So Edom revolted 
2KI.8.23	The rest of the acts of Jehoram and everything that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
2KI.8.24	Jehoram slept with his fathers [in death] and was buried with them in the City of David. Ahaziah his son became king in his place.
2KI.8.25	In the twelfth year of Joram (Jehoram) the son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign. 
2KI.8.26	Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah, the granddaughter of Omri king of Israel. 
2KI.8.27	He walked in the ways of the house of Ahab and did evil in the sight of the L
2KI.8.28	Ahaziah went with Joram the son of Ahab to battle against Hazael king of Aram (Syria) in Ramoth-gilead; and the Arameans wounded Joram. 
2KI.8.29	King Joram returned to Jezreel to be healed of the wounds which the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramah when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
2KI.9.1	Now Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets and said to him, “
2KI.9.2	When you arrive there, look for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in and have him arise from among his brothers, and take him into an inner room. 
2KI.9.3	Then take the flask of oil and pour it on his head and say, ‘Thus says the L
2KI.9.4	So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead. 
2KI.9.5	When he arrived, the captains of the army were sitting [outside]; and he said, “I have a message for you, O captain.” Jehu said, “To which one of us?” And he said, “For you, O captain.” 
2KI.9.6	So Jehu got up, and they went into the house. And he poured the oil on Jehu’s head and said to him, “Thus says the L
2KI.9.7	You shall strike the house of Ahab your master, so that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the L
2KI.9.8	For the entire house of Ahab shall perish, and I will cut off from Ahab every male, both bond and free, in Israel. 
2KI.9.9	I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah. 
2KI.9.10	And the dogs will eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel, and there will be no one to bury her.’ ” Then he opened the door and fled.
2KI.9.11	When Jehu came out to the servants of his master, one said to him, “Is all well? Why did this madman come to you?” And he said to them, “You know [very well] the man and his talk.” 
2KI.9.12	And they said, “It is a lie; tell us now.” And he said, “Thus and thus he spoke to me, saying, ‘Thus says the L
2KI.9.13	Then they hurried and each man took his garment and placed it [as a cushion] under Jehu on the top of the [outside] stairs, and blew the trumpet, saying, “Jehu is king!”
2KI.9.14	So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram [to dethrone and kill him]. Now Joram with all Israel was protecting Ramoth-gilead against Hazael king of Aram (Syria), 
2KI.9.15	but King 
2KI.9.16	So Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram was lying there. And Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.
2KI.9.17	Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel and he saw the crowd with Jehu as he approached, and said, “I see a company.” And 
2KI.9.18	So the horseman went to meet him and said, “Thus says the king: ‘Do you come in peace?’ ” And Jehu said, “What have you to do with peace? Rein in behind me.” And the watchman reported, “The messenger approached them, but he has not returned.” 
2KI.9.19	Then Joram sent out a second horseman, who approached them and said, “Thus says the king: ‘Do you come in peace?’ ” Jehu replied, “What have you to do with peace? Rein in behind me.” 
2KI.9.20	And the watchman reported, “He approached them, but he has not returned; and the driving [of the chariot] is like that of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously.”
2KI.9.21	Then 
2KI.9.22	When Joram saw Jehu, he said, “Do you come in peace, Jehu?” And he answered, “What peace [can exist] as long as the fornications of your mother Jezebel and her sorceries are so many?” 
2KI.9.23	So Joram reined [his chariot] around and fled, and he said to Ahaziah, “Treachery 
2KI.9.24	But Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and shot Joram between his shoulders; and the arrow went out through his heart and he sank down in his chariot. 
2KI.9.25	Then Jehu said to Bidkar his officer, “Pick him up and throw him on the property of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for I remember when you and I were riding together after his father Ahab, that the L
2KI.9.26	‘I certainly saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons yesterday,’ says the L
2KI.9.27	When Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. Jehu pursued him and said, “Shoot him too, [while he is] in the chariot.” 
2KI.9.28	Then his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem and buried him in his grave with his fathers in the City of David.
2KI.9.29	In the eleventh year of Joram, the son of Ahab, Ahaziah became king over Judah.
2KI.9.30	So when Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard about it, and she painted her eyes and adorned her head and looked down from the [upper] window. 
2KI.9.31	As Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, “Is it well, 
2KI.9.32	Then Jehu raised his face toward the window and said, “Who is on my side? Who?” And two or three officials looked down at him.
2KI.9.33	And he said, “Throw her down.” So they threw her down, and some of her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses, and he trampled her underfoot. 
2KI.9.34	When he came in, he ate and drank, and said, “See now to this cursed woman and bury her, for she is a king’s daughter.” 
2KI.9.35	They went to bury her, but they found nothing left of her except the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands. 
2KI.9.36	So they returned and told Jehu. Then he said, “This is the word of the L
2KI.9.37	The corpse of Jezebel will be like dung on the surface of the field in the property of Jezreel, so they cannot say, “This is Jezebel.” ’ ”
2KI.10.1	Ahab had seventy sons [and grandsons] in Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to the guardians of 
2KI.10.2	“Now as soon as this letter comes to you, since your master’s sons (male descendants) are with you, as well as chariots and horses and a fortified city and weapons, 
2KI.10.3	select the best and most capable of your master’s sons, and set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s [royal] house.” 
2KI.10.4	But they were extremely afraid and said, “Look, the two kings did not stand before Jehu; so how can we stand?” 
2KI.10.5	And the one who was in charge of the household, and the one who was overseer of the city, the elders, and the guardians [of the children] sent 
2KI.10.6	Then Jehu wrote a second letter to them, saying, “If you are with me and will obey me, take the heads of your master’s 
2KI.10.7	When the letter came to them, they took the king’s sons and slaughtered them, seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel. 
2KI.10.8	When a messenger came and told him, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons,” he said, “Put them in two heaps at the entrance of the city gate until morning.” 
2KI.10.9	The next morning he went out and stood and said to all the people, “You are just 
2KI.10.10	Know then [without any doubt] that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of the L
2KI.10.11	So Jehu killed all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men and his familiar friends and his priests, until he left him without a survivor.
2KI.10.12	And he set out and went to Samaria. On the way as he was at the 
2KI.10.13	Jehu met the relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and said, “Who are you?” They answered, “We are the relatives of Ahaziah; and we came down to greet the royal princes and the sons of the queen mother [Jezebel].” 
2KI.10.14	Then Jehu said, “Take them alive.” So they took them alive and [later] slaughtered them at the well by the place of the sand heaps, forty-two men; he left none of them [alive].
2KI.10.15	When Jehu went on from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab 
2KI.10.16	And he said, “Come with me and see my zeal for the L
2KI.10.17	When Jehu came to Samaria, he killed everyone who remained of Ahab’s family in Samaria, until he had destroyed all of them, in accordance with the word of the L
2KI.10.18	Jehu assembled all the people and said [in pretense] to them, “Ahab served Baal a little; Jehu will serve him much [more]. 
2KI.10.19	Now, summon unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshipers and all his priests. Let no one be missing, for I have a great sacrifice for Baal; whoever is missing shall not live.” But Jehu did it with trickery, in order to destroy the worshipers of Baal. 
2KI.10.20	Jehu said, “Consecrate a festive assembly (celebration) for Baal.” And they proclaimed it. 
2KI.10.21	Then Jehu sent throughout Israel, and all the worshipers of Baal came; there was no one left who did not come. They went to the house (temple) of Baal, and the house of Baal was filled from one end to the other. 
2KI.10.22	He said to the man in charge of the wardrobe, “Bring out garments for all the worshipers of Baal.” And he brought the garments out to them. 
2KI.10.23	Then Jehu with Jehonadab the son of Rechab went into the house of Baal; and he said to the worshipers of Baal, “Search carefully and see that there are no servants of the L
2KI.10.24	Then they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings.
2KI.10.25	Then it came about, as soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guards and to the royal officers, “Go in and kill them; let no one come out.” And they killed them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the royal officers threw 
2KI.10.26	They brought out the 
2KI.10.27	They also tore down the 
2KI.10.28	Thus Jehu eradicated Baal from Israel. 
2KI.10.29	However, Jehu did not turn from the [idolatrous] sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin, that is, [led them to worship] the golden calves which were at Bethel and Dan. 
2KI.10.30	The L
2KI.10.31	But Jehu did not take care to walk in the law of the L
2KI.10.33	from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites and the Reubenites and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the Arnon River, even Gilead and Bashan.
2KI.10.34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehu and everything that he did and all his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
2KI.10.35	Jehu slept with his fathers [in death], and they buried him in Samaria. Jehoahaz his son became king in his place. 
2KI.10.36	The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.
2KI.11.1	When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah [king of Judah] saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal offspring. 
2KI.11.2	But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram [of Judah and half] sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah and abducted him from among the king’s sons who were to be killed, and hid him and his nurse in the 
2KI.11.3	Joash was hidden with his nurse in the house (temple) of the L
2KI.11.4	Now in the seventh year Jehoiada [the priest, Jehosheba’s husband] sent for the captains of hundreds of the 
2KI.11.5	He commanded them, saying, “This is the thing that you shall do: a third of you who come in [reporting for duty] on the Sabbath shall keep watch over the king’s house 
2KI.11.6	(a third shall also be at the [city] gate Sur, and a third at the gate behind the guards); so you shall keep watch over the palace [from three posts] for defense. 
2KI.11.7	Two units of you, all those who go out [off duty] on the Sabbath, shall also keep watch over the house (temple) of the L
2KI.11.8	You shall surround the [young] king, each man with weapons in his hand; and whoever comes through the ranks shall be put to death. You are to be with the king when he goes out and when he comes in.”
2KI.11.9	The captains of hundreds acted in accordance with everything that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and each of them took his men who were to come in (on duty) on the Sabbath, with those who were to go out (off duty) on the Sabbath, and they came to Jehoiada the priest. 
2KI.11.10	The priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and shields that had been King David’s, which were in the house of the L
2KI.11.11	And the guards stood, each man with weapons in his hand, from the right side to the left side of the temple area, by the altar [in the courtyard] and by the temple [proper], all around the king. 
2KI.11.12	Then Jehoiada brought out the king’s son and put the crown on him and gave him the Testimony [a copy of the Mosaic Law]; and they made him king and anointed him, and they clapped their hands and said, “
2KI.11.13	When Athaliah heard the sound of the guards and of the people, she went into the house of the L
2KI.11.14	When she looked, behold, there stood the [young] king [on the platform] by the pillar, as was customary [on such occasions], and the captains and the trumpeters were beside the king; and all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing the trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and cried, “Treason! Treason!” 
2KI.11.15	Then Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds appointed over the army and said to them, “Take her out between the ranks, and whoever follows her put to death with the sword.” For the priest had said, “Let her not be put to death in the house (temple) of the L
2KI.11.16	So they seized her, and she went through the horses’ entrance to the king’s house (palace), and she was put to death there.
2KI.11.17	Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the L
2KI.11.18	Then all the people of the land went to the house of Baal and tore it down. They utterly smashed his altar and his images to pieces, and they put Mattan the priest of Baal to death in front of the altars. And [Jehoiada] the priest appointed officers over the house of the L
2KI.11.19	Then he took the captains of hundreds, the Carites (royal bodyguards), the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought the [young] king down from the house of the L
2KI.11.20	So all the people of the land rejoiced and the city [of Jerusalem] was quiet. For they had put Athaliah to death with the sword at the king’s house.
2KI.12.1	In the seventh year of Jehu [king of Israel], 
2KI.12.2	Jehoash did right in the sight of the L
2KI.12.3	Only the high places were not removed; the people were still sacrificing and burning incense [to the L
2KI.12.4	Jehoash said to the priests, “All the money for the dedicated things which is brought into the house of the L
2KI.12.5	let the priests receive such contributions for themselves, each from his acquaintance; and they shall repair any breach in the house 
2KI.12.6	But it came about in the twenty-third year of [the reign of] King Jehoash, that the priests 
2KI.12.7	Then King Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest and the [other] priests and said to them, “Why are you not repairing the damage of the house (temple)? Now then, do not take any more money from your acquaintances, but turn it all over for [the repair of] the damages of the house.” [You are no longer responsible for this work. I will take it into my own hands.] 
2KI.12.8	So the priests agreed that they would receive no [more] money from the people, nor [be responsible to] repair the damages of the house.
2KI.12.9	Then Jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in its lid and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one enters the house of the L
2KI.12.10	And whenever they saw that there was a large amount of money in the chest, the king’s scribe and the high priest came up and tied it in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of the L
2KI.12.11	Then they gave the money, which was weighed out into the hands of those who were doing the work, who had the oversight of the house of the L
2KI.12.12	and to the masons and stonecutters, and to buy timber and hewn (cut) stone to repair any breach in the house of the L
2KI.12.13	However, there were not made for the house of the L
2KI.12.14	but they gave that to those who did the work, and with it they repaired the house of the L
2KI.12.15	Moreover, they did not require an accounting from the men into whose hands they placed the money to be paid to those who did the work, for they acted in good faith.

2KI.13.7	For he left to Jehoahaz [king of Israel] an army of no more than fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and 10,000 footmen, for the king of Aram (Ben-hadad) had destroyed them and made them like dust to be trampled.

2KI.16.14	He brought the bronze altar, which was before the L
2KI.16.15	Then King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, “Upon the great [new] altar, burn the morning burnt offering and the evening grain offering, and the king’s burnt offering and his grain offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land and their grain offering and their drink offerings; and sprinkle on the new altar all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice. But the [old] bronze altar shall be kept for me to use to

2KI.16.17	Then King Ahaz cut away the frames of the basin stands [in the temple], and removed the basin from [each of] them; and he took down the [large] Sea from the bronze oxen which were under it, and put it on a plastered stone floor. 
2KI.16.18	He removed from the house of the L
2KI.16.19	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.16.20	So Ahaz slept with his fathers [in death] and was buried with his fathers in the City of David; and his son Hezekiah became king in his place.
2KI.17.1	In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah became king over Israel in Samaria, 
2KI.17.2	He did evil in the sight of the L
2KI.17.3	Shalmaneser [V] king of Assyria came up against him, and Hoshea became his servant and paid him tribute (money). 
2KI.17.4	But the king of Assyria discovered a conspiracy in Hoshea, who sent messengers to So, king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as 
2KI.17.5	Then the king of Assyria invaded all the land [of Israel] and went up to 
2KI.17.6	In the ninth year of Hoshea, 
2KI.17.7	Now this came about because the Israelites had sinned against the L
2KI.17.8	and walked in the customs of the [pagan] nations whom the L
2KI.17.9	The Israelites ascribed things to the L
2KI.17.10	They set up for themselves

2KI.17.15	They rejected His statutes and His covenant which He made with their fathers, as well as His warnings that he gave them. And they followed vanity [that is, false gods, idols] and became vain (empty-headed). They followed the [pagan practices of the] nations which surrounded them, although the L
2KI.17.16	They abandoned all the commandments of the L
2KI.17.17	They made their sons and their daughters pass through the fire [as human sacrifices], and used divination [to foretell the future] and enchantments; and they sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the L
2KI.17.18	Therefore the L
2KI.17.19	Judah did not keep the commandments of the L
2KI.17.20	So the L
2KI.17.21	When He had torn Israel from the [royal] house of David, they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king. And Jeroboam drove Israel away from following the L

2KI.17.23	until the L
2KI.17.24	The king of Assyria brought 
2KI.17.25	Now when they began to live there, they did not fear the L
2KI.17.26	So the king of Assyria was told, “The nations whom you have sent into exile and settled in the cities of Samaria do not know the custom of the god of the land; so He has sent lions among them, and they are killing them because they do not know the manner of [worship demanded by] the god of the land.”
2KI.17.27	Then the king of Assyria commanded, “Take back [to Samaria] one of the priests whom you brought from there, and have him go and live there; and have him teach the people the custom of the god of the land.” 
2KI.17.28	So one of the priests whom they had exiled from Samaria came [back] and lived in Bethel and taught them how they should fear [and worship] the L
2KI.17.29	But every nation still made gods of its own and put them in the houses (shrines) of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in the cities where they lived. 
2KI.17.30	The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima, 
2KI.17.31	the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim. 
2KI.17.32	They also feared the L
2KI.17.33	They feared the L
2KI.17.34	To this day they act in accordance with their former [pagan] customs: they do not [really] fear the L

2KI.17.37	The statutes and the ordinances and the law and the commandment which He wrote for you [by the hand of Moses], you shall observe and do forever. You shall not fear (worship, serve) other gods. 
2KI.17.38	The covenant that I have made with you, you shall not forget; you shall not fear other gods. 
2KI.17.39	But the L
2KI.17.40	However, they did not listen, but they acted in accordance with their former custom. 
2KI.17.41	So these nations [superficially] feared the L
2KI.18.1	Now it came about in the third year of Hoshea the son of Elah king of Israel, Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah became king. 
2KI.18.2	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah. 
2KI.18.3	Hezekiah did right in the sight of the L
2KI.18.4	He removed the high places [of pagan worship], broke down the images (memorial stones) and cut down the Asherim. He also crushed to pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for until those days the Israelites had burned incense to it; and it was called 
2KI.18.5	Hezekiah trusted in

2KI.18.8	He defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza [the most distant city] and its borders, from the [isolated] lookout tower to the [populous] fortified city.
2KI.18.9	Now in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh of Hoshea the son of Elah king of Israel, Shalmaneser the king of Assyria went up against Samaria and besieged it. 
2KI.18.10	At the end of three years they captured it; in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Israel, Samaria was taken. 
2KI.18.11	Then the king of Assyria sent Israel into exile to Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of [the city of] Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes, 
2KI.18.12	because they did not obey the voice of the L
2KI.18.13	In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria went up against all the fortified cities of Judah [except Jerusalem] and captured them. 
2KI.18.14	Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent 
2KI.18.15	Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house (temple) of the L

2KI.18.19	Then the Rabshakeh said to them, “Say to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, “What is [the reason for] this confidence that you have? 
2KI.18.20	You say (but they are only empty words) ‘

2KI.18.24	How then can you drive back 
2KI.18.25	Now have I come up against this place to destroy it without the L
2KI.18.26	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna and Joah, said to the Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in the Aramaic (Syrian) language, because we understand it; and do not speak with us in the Judean (Hebrew) language in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.” 
2KI.18.27	But the Rabshakeh said to them, “Has my master sent me 
2KI.18.28	Then the Rabshakeh stood and shouted out with a loud voice in Judean (Hebrew), “Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria. 
2KI.18.29	Thus says the king, ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to rescue you from my hand; 
2KI.18.30	nor let Hezekiah make you trust in 
2KI.18.31	Do not listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria: “Surrender to me and come out to [meet] me, and every man may eat from his own vine and fig tree, and every man may drink the waters of his own well,

2KI.18.35	Who among all the gods of the lands have rescued their lands from my hand, that the L
2KI.18.36	But the people kept silent and did not answer him, for the king had commanded, “Do not answer him.” 
2KI.18.37	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the [royal] household, and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph the secretary, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn [in grief and despair] and told him what the Rabshakeh had said.
2KI.19.1	When king Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes and he covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house (temple) of the L
2KI.19.2	Then he sent Eliakim who was in charge of his household, Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. 
2KI.19.3	They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, ‘This is a day of distress

2KI.19.8	So the Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah [a fortified city of Judah]; for he had heard that the king had left Lachish. 
2KI.19.9	When the king heard them say concerning Tirhakah king of 
2KI.19.10	“Say this to Hezekiah king of Judah, ‘Do not let your God on whom you rely deceive you by saying, “Jerusalem shall not be handed over to the king of Assyria.” 
2KI.19.11	Listen, you have heard what the Assyrian kings have done to all the lands, destroying them completely. So will you be spared? 
2KI.19.12	Did the gods of the nations whom my forefathers destroyed rescue them—Gozan and Haran [of Mesopotamia] and Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Telassar? 
2KI.19.13	Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad [of northern Syria], the king of the city of Sepharvaim, and of Hena and Ivvah?’ ”
2KI.19.14	Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the house (temple) of the L
2KI.19.15	Hezekiah prayed before the L
2KI.19.16	O L
2KI.19.17	It is true, L
2KI.19.18	and have thrown their gods into the fire, for they were not [real] gods but [only] the work of men’s hands, wood and stone. So they [could destroy them and] have destroyed them. 
2KI.19.19	Now, O L
2KI.19.20	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent 
2KI.19.21	This is the word that the L
2KI.19.21	‘The virgin daughter of Zion
2KI.19.21	Has despised you and mocked you;
2KI.19.21	The daughter of Jerusalem
2KI.19.21	Has shaken her head behind you!
2KI.19.22	Whom have you taunted and blasphemed?
2KI.19.22	Against whom have you raised your voice,
2KI.19.22	And haughtily lifted up your eyes?
2KI.19.22	Against the Holy One of Israel!
2KI.19.23	Through your messengers you have taunted 
2KI.19.23	And have said [boastfully], “With my many chariots
2KI.19.23	I came up to the heights of the mountains,
2KI.19.23	To the remotest parts of Lebanon;
2KI.19.23	I cut down its tall cedar trees and its choicest cypress trees.
2KI.19.23	I entered its most distant lodging, its densest forest.
2KI.19.24	I dug 
2KI.19.24	And with the sole of my feet I dried up
2KI.19.24	All the rivers of [the Lower Nile of] Egypt.”
2KI.19.25	‘Have you not heard [asks the God of Israel]?
2KI.19.25	Long ago I did it;
2KI.19.25	From ancient times I planned it.
2KI.19.25	Now I have brought it to pass,
2KI.19.25	That you [king of Assyria] should [be My instrument to] turn fortified cities into ruinous heaps.
2KI.19.26	Therefore their inhabitants were powerless,
2KI.19.26	They were shattered [in spirit] and put to shame;
2KI.19.26	They were like plants of the field, the green herb,
2KI.19.26	As grass on the housetops is scorched before it is grown up.
2KI.19.27	But I [the L
2KI.19.27	Your going out, your coming in,
2KI.19.27	And your raging against Me.
2KI.19.28	Because of your raging against Me,
2KI.19.28	And because your arrogance 
2KI.19.28	I will put My hook in your nose,
2KI.19.28	And My bridle in your lips,
2KI.19.28	And I will turn you back [to Assyria] by the way that you came.
2KI.19.29	‘Then this shall be the sign [of these things] to you [Hezekiah]: this year you will eat what grows of itself, in the second year what springs up voluntarily, and in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. 
2KI.19.30	The survivors who remain of the house of Judah will again take root downward and bear fruit upward. 
2KI.19.31	For a remnant will go forth from Jerusalem, and [a band of] survivors from Mount Zion. The zeal of the L
2KI.19.32	‘Therefore thus says the L
2KI.19.33	By the way that he came, by the same way he will return, and he will not come into this city,” ’ declares the L
2KI.19.34	‘For I will protect this city to save it, for My own sake and for My servant David’s sake.’ ”
2KI.19.35	Then it came to pass that night, that the 
2KI.19.36	So Sennacherib king of Assyria 
2KI.19.37	It came about as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with a sword; and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son became king in his place.
2KI.20.1	In those days [when Sennacherib first invaded Judah] Hezekiah became deathly ill. The prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came and said to him, “Thus says the L
2KI.20.2	Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the L
2KI.20.3	“Please, O L
2KI.20.4	Before Isaiah had gone out of the middle courtyard, the word of the L
2KI.20.5	“Go back and tell Hezekiah the leader of My people, ‘Thus says the L
2KI.20.6	I will add fifteen years to your life and save you and this city [Jerusalem] from the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will protect this city for My own sake and for My servant David’s sake.” ’ ” 
2KI.20.7	Then Isaiah said, “Bring a cake of figs. And they brought it and placed it on the [painful] inflammation, and he recovered.”
2KI.20.8	Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “What will be the sign that the L
2KI.20.9	Isaiah said, “This will be the sign to you from the L
2KI.20.10	Hezekiah answered, “It is easy for the shadow to go forward ten steps; no, but let the shadow turn backward ten steps.” 
2KI.20.11	So Isaiah the prophet called out to the L
2KI.20.12	At that time 
2KI.20.13	Hezekiah listened to 
2KI.20.14	Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him, “What did these men say [that would cause you to do this for them]? From where have they come to you?” Hezekiah said, “They have come from a far country, from Babylon.” 
2KI.20.15	Isaiah said, “What have they seen in your house?” Hezekiah answered, “They have seen everything that is in my house (palace). There is nothing in my treasuries that I have not shown them.”
2KI.20.16	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the L
2KI.20.17	‘Behold, the time is coming when everything that is in your house, and that your fathers have stored up until this day, will be carried to Babylon; nothing will be left,’ says the L
2KI.20.18	‘And some of your sons (descendants) who will be born to you will be 
2KI.20.19	Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the L
2KI.20.20	The rest of the acts of Hezekiah and all his might, and how he made the [Siloam] pool and the aqueduct and brought water into the city, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.20.21	Hezekiah slept with his fathers [in death], and Manasseh his son became king in his place.
2KI.21.1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he 
2KI.21.2	He did [great] evil in the sight of the L
2KI.21.3	For he rebuilt the high places [for the worship of pagan gods] which his father Hezekiah had destroyed; and he set up altars for Baal and made an [image of] Asherah, just as Ahab king of Israel had done, and he worshiped all the [starry] host of heaven and served them. 
2KI.21.4	And he built [pagan] altars in the house (temple) of the L
2KI.21.5	And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courtyards of the house of the L
2KI.21.6	He made his son pass through the fire 
2KI.21.7	He made a carved image of the [goddess] Asherah and set it up in the house (temple), of which the L
2KI.21.8	And I will not make the feet of Israel wander anymore from the land which I gave their fathers, if only they will be careful to act in accordance with everything that I have commanded them, and with all the law that My servant Moses commanded them.” 
2KI.21.9	But they did not listen; and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than the nations whom the L
2KI.21.10	Now the L
2KI.21.11	“Because Manasseh king of Judah has committed these repulsive acts, having done more evil than all the Amorites did who were before him, and has also made Judah sin with his idols; 
2KI.21.12	therefore thus says the L
2KI.21.13	I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe Jerusalem clean just as one wipes a [dirty] bowl clean, wiping it and turning it upside down. 
2KI.21.14	I will abandon the remnant (remainder) of My inheritance and hand them over to their enemies; and they will become plunder and spoil to all their enemies, 
2KI.21.15	because they have done evil in My sight, and have been provoking Me to anger, since the day their fathers came from Egypt to this day.’ ”
2KI.21.16	Moreover, Manasseh shed a very great quantity of innocent blood, until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin with which he made Judah sin, by doing evil in the sight of the L
2KI.21.17	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, everything that he did, and the sin that he committed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.21.18	Manasseh slept with his fathers [in death] and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza. And his son Amon became king in his place.
2KI.21.19	Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. 
2KI.21.20	He also did evil in the sight of the L
2KI.21.21	He walked in all the [evil] ways that his father had walked; and he served the idols that his father had served, and worshiped them; 
2KI.21.22	he abandoned the L
2KI.21.23	But the servants of Amon conspired against him and killed the king in his own house (palace). 
2KI.21.24	Then the people of the land [of Judah] killed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place. 
2KI.21.25	Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.21.26	He was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza, and his son Josiah became king in his place.
2KI.22.1	Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and reigned for thirty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath. 
2KI.22.2	He did what was right in the sight of the L
2KI.22.3	In the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam the scribe to the house of the L
2KI.22.4	“Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, so that he may count the entire amount of money brought into the house of the L
2KI.22.5	And have them deliver it to the hands of the workmen who have been appointed over the house of the L
2KI.22.6	that is, [have them give the money] to the carpenters and the builders and the masons—and to buy timber and cut stones to repair the house (temple). 
2KI.22.7	However, no accounting shall be required of them for the money placed in their hands, because they act faithfully.”
2KI.22.8	Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the Book of the Law in the house (temple) of the L
2KI.22.9	Shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought back word to him: “Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have placed it in the hands of the workmen who have been appointed over the house of the L
2KI.22.10	Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read it [aloud] before the king.
2KI.22.11	Now when the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his clothes. 
2KI.22.12	Then the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Achbor the son of Micaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the servant of the king, saying, 
2KI.22.13	“Go, inquire of the L
2KI.22.14	So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (she was living in Jerusalem, in the Second Quarter [the new part of the city]); and they spoke to her. 
2KI.22.15	She said to them, “Thus says the L
2KI.22.16	thus says the L
2KI.22.17	Because they have abandoned (rejected) Me and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke Me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore My wrath burns against this place, and it will not be quenched.” ’ 
2KI.22.18	But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the L
2KI.22.19	because your heart was tender (receptive, penitent) and you humbled yourself before the L
2KI.22.20	“Therefore, behold, [King Josiah,] I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be taken to your grave in peace, and your eyes will not see all the evil (catastrophe) which I will bring on this place.” ’ ” So they brought back word to the king.
2KI.23.1	King Josiah sent 
2KI.23.2	The king went up to the house of the L
2KI.23.3	The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the L
2KI.23.4	Then the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest and the priests of the second rank and the doorkeepers to bring out of the temple of the L
2KI.23.5	He got rid of the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense [to pagan gods] in the high places in Judah’s cities and all around Jerusalem—also those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, to the moon, to the constellations [of the zodiac], and to all the [starry] host of heaven. 
2KI.23.6	Josiah brought out the Asherah from the house of the L
2KI.23.7	And he tore down the houses of the [male] cult prostitutes, which were at the house (temple) of the L
2KI.23.8	Then Josiah brought all the [idolatrous] priests from the cities of Judah, and desecrated the high places where the priests had burned incense [to idols], from Geba to Beersheba, [that is, north to south]; and he tore down the high places of the gates which were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on one’s left at the city gate. 
2KI.23.9	However, the priests of the high places were not allowed to go up to the altar of the L
2KI.23.10	Josiah also defiled Topheth, which is in the Valley of Ben-hinnom (son of Hinnom), so that no man could make his son or his daughter pass through the fire [as a burnt offering] for Molech. 
2KI.23.11	And he got rid of the horses that the kings of Judah had given [in worship] to the sun at the entrance of the house of the L
2KI.23.12	The altars [dedicated to the starry host of heaven] which were on the roof, the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courtyards of the house of the L
2KI.23.13	The king desecrated the high places which were opposite [east of] Jerusalem, which were on the right (south) of the mount of corruption which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the repulsiveness of the Sidonians, for Chemosh the repulsiveness of Moab, and for Milcom the repulsiveness of the sons (descendants) of Ammon. 
2KI.23.14	He broke in pieces the 
2KI.23.15	Further, the altar that was at Bethel, the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he tore down. Then he demolished its stones, ground them to dust, and burned the Asherah. 
2KI.23.16	And as Josiah turned, he saw the graves that were there on the mountain, and he sent 
2KI.23.17	Then Josiah said, “What is this monument (gravestone) that I see?” The men of the city told him, “It is the grave of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things which you have done to the altar of Bethel.” 
2KI.23.18	He said, “Let him alone; let no one disturb his bones.” So they left his bones undisturbed, with the bones of the prophet who came from Samaria. 
2KI.23.19	Josiah also removed all the houses of the high places which were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made provoking the L
2KI.23.20	All the priests of the high places who were there he slaughtered on the altars, and burned human bones on them [to desecrate the places forever]. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
2KI.23.21	Then the king commanded all the people, saying, “Celebrate the Passover to the L
2KI.23.22	Indeed, such a Passover as this had not been held since the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah. 
2KI.23.23	But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover to the L
2KI.23.24	Moreover, Josiah removed the mediums and the soothsayers and the teraphim (household gods) and the idols and all the repulsive things that were seen in Judah and in Jerusalem, so that he might fulfill the words of the law written in the book which Hilkiah the priest found in the house (temple) of the L
2KI.23.25	Before him there was no king like Josiah who turned to the L
2KI.23.26	However, the L
2KI.23.27	The L
2KI.23.28	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, everything that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.23.29	In his days Pharaoh Neco (Necho) king of Egypt went up to the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates [to help him fight Nabopolassar the king of Babylon]. King Josiah went out to meet him, but Pharaoh killed Josiah at Megiddo when he saw him. 
2KI.23.30	Josiah’s servants carried his dead body in a chariot from Megiddo, brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and anointed him and made him king in his father’s place.
2KI.23.31	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned for [only] three months in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
2KI.23.32	He did evil in the sight of the L
2KI.23.33	Pharaoh Neco imprisoned him at Riblah in the land of Hamath, so that he would not reign in Jerusalem, and imposed a fine on the land of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
2KI.23.34	Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in place of his father Josiah, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. But he took Jehoahaz and brought him to Egypt, where he died. 
2KI.23.35	Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh, but he taxed the land to give the money as Pharaoh commanded. He collected the silver and gold from the people of the land, from everyone according to his assessment, to give it to Pharaoh Neco.
2KI.23.36	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zebidah daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah. 
2KI.23.37	He did evil in the sight of the L
2KI.24.1	In his days, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant for three years; then he turned and rebelled against him. 
2KI.24.2	The L
2KI.24.3	Surely this came on Judah at the command of the L
2KI.24.4	and also for the innocent blood that he shed, for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; and the L
2KI.24.5	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and everything that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
2KI.24.6	So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers [in death], and his son Jehoiachin became king in his place. 
2KI.24.7	The king of Egypt did not come out of his land again, because the 
2KI.24.8	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned [only] three months in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. 
2KI.24.9	He did evil in the sight of the L
2KI.24.10	At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon went up to Jerusalem, and the city came under siege. 
2KI.24.11	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to the city while his servants were besieging it. 
2KI.24.12	Jehoiachin king of Judah surrendered to the king of Babylon, he and his mother and his servants and his captains and his [palace] officials. So the king of Babylon took him prisoner in the eighth year of his [own] reign. 
2KI.24.13	He carried out of there (Jerusalem) all the treasures of the house (temple) of the L
2KI.24.14	He led away into exile all Jerusalem and all the captains and all the brave men, ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths. None remained except the poorest people of the land.
2KI.24.15	Nebuchadnezzar led Jehoiachin away into exile to Babylon; also he took the king’s mother and the king’s wives and his officials and the leading men of the land [including Ezekiel] as exiles from Jerusalem to Babylon. 
2KI.24.16	And the king of Babylon brought as exiles to Babylon all the brave men, seven thousand [of them], and the craftsmen and the smiths, a thousand [of them], all strong and fit for war.
2KI.24.17	Then the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s uncle, king in his place, and changed his name to Zedekiah.
2KI.24.18	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
2KI.24.19	He did evil in the sight of the L
2KI.24.20	Because of the anger of the L
2KI.25.1	Now in the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he with all his army, against Jerusalem, and camped against it and built siege works surrounding it. 
2KI.25.2	The city came under siege [for nearly two years] until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. 
2KI.25.3	On the ninth day of the 
2KI.25.4	Then the city [wall] was broken into [and conquered]; all the men of war 
2KI.25.5	The army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho. Then his entire army was dispersed from him. 
2KI.25.6	So they seized the king (Zedekiah) and brought him to the king of Babylon at Riblah [on the Orontes River], and sentence was passed on him. 
2KI.25.7	They slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, then put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him [hand and foot] with bronze fetters and brought him to Babylon.
2KI.25.8	On the seventh day of the fifth month in the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, captain of the bodyguard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. 
2KI.25.9	He burned the house (temple) of the L
2KI.25.10	All the army of the Chaldeans (Babylonians) who 
2KI.25.11	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard deported [into exile] the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had joined the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude. 
2KI.25.12	But the captain of the bodyguard left some of the unimportant 
2KI.25.13	Now the Chaldeans (Babylonians) smashed the bronze pillars which were in the house of the L
2KI.25.14	They took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the spoons, and all the bronze articles which were used in the 
2KI.25.15	the captain of the bodyguard also took away the firepans and basins, anything made of fine gold and anything made of fine silver. 
2KI.25.16	The two pillars, the one sea (large basin), and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the L
2KI.25.17	The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits (27 ft.), and a capital of bronze was on top of it. The height of the capital was three cubits (4.5 ft.); a network (lattice work) and pomegranates around the capital were all of bronze. And the second pillar had the same as these, with a network.
2KI.25.18	The captain of the bodyguard took [captive] Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers [of the temple]. 
2KI.25.19	And from the city [of Jerusalem] he took an officer who was in command of the men of war, and five men from the king’s personal advisors who were found in the city, and the scribe of the captain of the army who mustered the people of the land [for military service] and sixty men from the people of the land who were found in the city. 
2KI.25.20	Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
2KI.25.21	Then the king of Babylon struck them down and killed them at Riblah in the land of Hamath [north of Damascus]. So Judah was taken into exile from its land.
2KI.25.22	Now over the people whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left in the land of Judah, he appointed [as governor] Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan. 
2KI.25.23	When all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah 
2KI.25.24	Gedaliah swore [an oath] to them and their men, and said to them, “Do not be afraid of the servants (officials) of the Chaldeans. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you.”
2KI.25.25	But in the seventh month Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family [who had a claim to be governor], came with ten men and struck and killed Gedaliah and the Jews and the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah. 
2KI.25.26	Then all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces set out and went to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans (Babylonians).
2KI.25.27	Now it came about in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, on the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he became king, showed favor to Jehoiachin king of Judah 
2KI.25.28	and he spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the throne of the [other] kings [of captive peoples] who were with him in Babylon. 
2KI.25.29	Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes [for palace garments] and he dined regularly in the king’s presence for the remainder of his life; 
2KI.25.30	and his allowance, a continual one, was given to him by the king (Evil-meridach), a portion every day, for the rest of his life.

1CH.11.14	But they took their stand in the midst of that plot and defended it, and killed the Philistines; and the L
1CH.11.15	Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam, while the army of the Philistines was camped in the Valley of Rephaim. 
1CH.11.16	David was then in the stronghold, while the garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem. 
1CH.11.17	David had a craving and said, “Oh that someone would give me a drink of water from the well of Bethlehem, which is next to the gate!” 
1CH.11.18	Then the three [mighty men] broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem which was next to the gate, and brought it to David. But David would not drink it; he poured it out to the L
1CH.11.19	and he said, “Far be it from me before my God that I would do this thing! Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in jeopardy? For they brought it at the risk of their lives.” So he would not drink it. These things the three mighty men did.
1CH.11.20	Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of the [other]

1CH.12.1	These are the ones who came to David at Ziklag, while he still concealed himself from Saul the son of Kish; they were among the courageous men who helped him in battle. 
1CH.12.2	They were armed with bows, and could use the right hand or the left to 
1CH.12.3	The chief was Ahiezer and then Joash, the sons of Shemaah of Gibeah; Jeziel and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah, and Jehu of Anathoth,

1CH.12.7	and Joelah and Zebadiah the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.
1CH.12.8	Courageous men from the Gadites came over to David in the stronghold in the wilderness, men trained for war, who could handle shield and spear, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and who were swift as gazelles on the mountains. 
1CH.12.9	Ezer was the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,

1CH.12.14	These from the sons (descendants) of Gad were captains of the army; he who was least was 
1CH.12.15	These are the men who crossed over the Jordan in the first month when it had overflowed all its banks and they put to flight all those in the valleys, east and west.
1CH.12.16	Then some of the 
1CH.12.17	David went out to meet them and said to them, “If you have come peacefully to me to help me, my heart shall be united with you; but if 
1CH.12.18	Then the [Holy] Spirit came on Amasai, who was chief of the thirty, 
1CH.12.18	“We are yours, O David,
1CH.12.18	And with you, O son of Jesse!
1CH.12.18	Peace, peace be to you,
1CH.12.18	And peace be to him who helps you;
1CH.12.18	For your God helps you.”
1CH.12.18	Then David accepted 
1CH.12.19	Some [of the men] of Manasseh also defected to David when he came with the Philistines to go to battle against Saul. But David’s men did not [actually] assist the Philistines, for the lords (governors) of the Philistines after consultation sent him away, saying, “At 
1CH.12.20	As David went to Ziklag, 
1CH.12.21	They helped David against the band of raiders, for they were all courageous men, and [all seven] became commanders in his army. 
1CH.12.22	For day by day men kept coming to David to help him, until there was a great army, like the army of God.
1CH.12.23	These are the numbers of the [armed] units equipped for war who came to David at Hebron to turn [over] the kingdom of Saul to him, in accordance with the word of the L
1CH.12.24	Those of the tribe of Judah who carried shield and spear were 6,800, armed for war; 
1CH.12.25	of the tribe of Simeon, brave warriors, 7,100; 
1CH.12.26	of the tribe of Levi, 4,600. 
1CH.12.27	Jehoiada was the leader of [the house of] Aaron, and with him were 3,700, 
1CH.12.28	and Zadok, a courageous young man, and twenty-two captains from his father’s house. 
1CH.12.29	Of the tribe of Benjamin, the relatives of [King] Saul, 3,000; for until now the majority of them had kept their allegiance to the house of Saul. 
1CH.12.30	Of the tribe of Ephraim, 20,800, courageous men, famous in their fathers’ houses. 
1CH.12.31	Of the half-tribe of Manasseh, 18,000, who were designated by name to come and make David king. 
1CH.12.32	Of the tribe of Issachar, men who understood the times, with knowledge of what Israel should do, two hundred chiefs; and all their relatives were at their command; 
1CH.12.33	of the tribe of Zebulun, there were 50,000 in military service who could draw up in battle formation with all kinds of weapons of war and helped 
1CH.12.34	Of the tribe of Naphtali, 
1CH.12.35	Of the tribe of Dan, 28,600 men who could draw up in battle formation. 
1CH.12.36	Of the tribe of Asher, 40,000 men in military service, able to draw up in battle formation. 
1CH.12.37	From the other side [east] of the Jordan 
1CH.12.38	All these, being men of war arrayed in battle formation, came to Hebron with a perfect (committed) heart to make David king over all Israel; and all the rest of Israel were also of one mind to make David king. 
1CH.12.39	They were there with David for three days, eating and drinking, for their relatives had prepared for them. 
1CH.12.40	Also those who were [living] near them [from] as far as [the tribes of] Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, brought food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen, abundant supplies of flour, cakes of figs and raisins, wine, [olive] oil, oxen, and sheep, for there was joy in Israel.
1CH.13.1	David consulted with the captains of the thousands and the hundreds, even with every leader. 
1CH.13.2	David said to all the assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you, and if it is from the L
1CH.13.3	and let us bring back the ark of our God to us, 
1CH.13.4	Then all the assembly agreed to do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
1CH.13.5	So David gathered all Israel together, from the Shihor [watercourse] of Egypt, to the entrance of Hamath [in the north], to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim. 
1CH.13.6	David and all Israel went up to Baalah, 
1CH.13.7	They 
1CH.13.8	David and all Israel celebrated [joyfully] before God with all their might, with songs, lyres, harps, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.
1CH.13.9	When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put out his hand to hold 
1CH.13.10	The anger of the L
1CH.13.11	David became angry because of the L
1CH.13.12	David was afraid of God that day, and he said, “How can I bring the ark of God 
1CH.13.13	So David did not bring the ark with him to the City of David, but took it aside to the house of 
1CH.13.14	So the ark of God remained with the 
1CH.14.1	Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar timbers, masons and carpenters, to build a house (palace) for him. 
1CH.14.2	And David understood that the L
1CH.14.3	Then David took more wives at Jerusalem, and he became the father of more sons and daughters. 
1CH.14.4	Now these are the 
1CH.14.5	Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 
1CH.14.6	Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 
1CH.14.7	Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
1CH.14.8	When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, they all went up in search of David; and he heard about it and went out against them. 
1CH.14.9	Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the Valley of Rephaim. 
1CH.14.10	So David inquired of God, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? And will You hand them over to me?” Then the L
1CH.14.11	So Israel came up to Baal-perazim, and David defeated the Philistines there. Then David said, “God has broken through my enemies by my hand, like the breakthrough of waters.” Therefore they named that place 
1CH.14.12	The Philistines abandoned their gods (idols) there; so David gave a command and they were burned in a fire [as the Law of Moses required].
1CH.14.13	The Philistines again made a raid in the valley. 
1CH.14.14	So David inquired again of God, and God said to him, “Do not go up after them; circle around behind them and come at them in front of the balsam trees. 
1CH.14.15	It shall be when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then you shall go out to battle, for God has gone out before you to strike the Philistine army.” 
1CH.14.16	So David did just as God had commanded him, and they struck down the army of the Philistines from Gibeon as far as Gezer. 
1CH.14.17	Then David’s fame spread into all the lands; and the L
1CH.15.2	Then David said, “No one is to carry the ark of God except the Levites; for the L
1CH.15.3	And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the L
1CH.15.4	David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites: 
1CH.15.5	of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, with 120 of his relatives; 
1CH.15.6	of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, with 220 of his relatives; 
1CH.15.7	of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, with 130 of his relatives; 
1CH.15.8	of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, with 200 of his relatives; 
1CH.15.9	of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, with 80 of his relatives; 
1CH.15.10	of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, with 112 of his relatives.
1CH.15.11	Then David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites—Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab, 
1CH.15.12	and he said to them, “You are the heads of the fathers’ 
1CH.15.13	Because you did not [carry it as God directed] the first time, the L
1CH.15.14	So the priests and the Levites consecrated (dedicated) themselves to bring up the ark of the L
1CH.15.15	The Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles, as Moses commanded in accordance with the word of the L
1CH.15.16	Then David told the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their relatives as the singers, with instruments of music—harps, lyres, and cymbals—to play loudly 
1CH.15.17	So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel, and from his relatives, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and from the sons of Merari their relatives, Ethan the son of Kushaiah, 
1CH.15.18	and with them their relatives of the second rank: Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the gatekeepers. 
1CH.15.19	So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan 
1CH.15.20	and Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah [were to play] with 
1CH.15.21	and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to lead with lyres set to Sheminith [that is, the eighth string, a low pitch]. 
1CH.15.22	Chenaniah, leader of the Levites, was 
1CH.15.23	Berechiah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the ark. 
1CH.15.24	Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer the priests blew the trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah (Jeiel) were also gatekeepers for the ark.
1CH.15.25	So David, with the elders of Israel and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the L
1CH.15.26	Because God was helping the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the L
1CH.15.27	David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who carried the ark, and the singers and Chenaniah, director of the music of the singers. David also wore an ephod (a priestly upper garment) of linen. 
1CH.15.28	Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the L
1CH.15.29	It happened that as the ark of the covenant of the L
1CH.16.1	So they brought the ark of God and set it inside the tent which David had pitched for it, and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God. 
1CH.16.2	When David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the L
1CH.16.3	He distributed to everyone in Israel, both man and woman, to everyone a loaf of bread, a portion 
1CH.16.4	He appointed some of the Levites to minister before the ark of the L
1CH.16.5	Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, 
1CH.16.6	and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests 
1CH.16.7	Then on that day David first entrusted to Asaph and his relatives to give thanks to the L
1CH.16.8	O give thanks to the L
1CH.16.8	Make His deeds known among the peoples.
1CH.16.9	Sing to Him, sing praises to Him;
1CH.16.9	Speak of all His wonders.
1CH.16.10	Glory in His holy name;

1CH.16.14	His judgments are in all the earth.
1CH.16.15	Be mindful of His covenant forever,
1CH.16.15	The promise which He commanded 
1CH.16.16	And His oath (sworn promise) to Isaac.
1CH.16.17	He confirmed it as a statute to Jacob,
1CH.16.17	And to Israel as an everlasting covenant,
1CH.16.18	Saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan,
1CH.16.18	As the portion of your possession 
1CH.16.19	When you were few in number,
1CH.16.19	Even a very few, and strangers in it,

1CH.16.23	Proclaim the good news of His salvation from day to day.
1CH.16.24	Declare His glory among the nations,
1CH.16.24	His marvelous works among all peoples.
1CH.16.25	For great is the L
1CH.16.25	He is also to be feared [with awe-filled reverence] above all gods.
1CH.16.26	For all the gods of the peoples are [lifeless] idols,

1CH.16.27	Splendor and majesty are [found] in His presence;
1CH.16.27	Strength and joy are [found] in His place (sanctuary).

1CH.16.28	Ascribe to the L
1CH.16.29	Ascribe to the L
1CH.16.29	Bring an offering [of thanksgiving], and come before Him;

1CH.16.30	The world is firmly established, it will not be moved.
1CH.16.31	Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice;
1CH.16.31	And let them say among the nations, “The L
1CH.16.32	Let the sea roar, and all the things that fill it;
1CH.16.32	Let the field rejoice, and all that is in it.
1CH.16.33	Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before the L
1CH.16.33	For He comes to judge 
1CH.16.34	O give thanks to the L
1CH.16.34	For His lovingkindness endures forever.
1CH.16.35	Then say, “Save us, O God of our salvation;
1CH.16.35	Gather us together and rescue us from the nations,
1CH.16.35	That we may give thanks to Your holy name,
1CH.16.35	And glory in Your praise.”
1CH.16.36	Blessed be the L
1CH.16.36	Forever and ever.
1CH.16.36	And all the people said, “Amen,” and praised the L
1CH.16.37	So David left Asaph and his relatives there before the ark of the covenant of the L
1CH.16.38	and Obed-edom with his sixty-eight relatives; also Obed-edom the son of Jeduthun, and Hosah, were to be gatekeepers. 
1CH.16.39	 Zadok the priest and his relatives the priests before the dwelling place (tabernacle) of the L
1CH.16.40	to offer burnt offerings to the L
1CH.16.41	With them were Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest who were chosen and designated by name, to give thanks to the L
1CH.16.42	With them were Heman and Jeduthun 
1CH.16.43	Then all the people departed, each to his house, and David returned [home] to bless his household.
1CH.17.1	As David sat in his house (palace), he said to Nathan the prophet, “Behold, I live in a house of cedars, while the ark of the covenant of the L
1CH.17.2	Then Nathan said to David, “
1CH.17.3	But it came about that same night that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, 
1CH.17.4	“Go and tell David My servant, ‘Thus says the L
1CH.17.5	for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought Israel up [from Egypt] until this day, but I have gone from tent to tent and from 
1CH.17.6	Wherever I have walked with all Israel, did I say a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people, saying, ‘Why have you not built for Me a house of cedar?’ ” ’ 
1CH.17.7	Now, therefore, this is what you shall say to My servant David: ‘Thus says the L
1CH.17.8	I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make your name like the name of the great ones of the earth. 
1CH.17.9	I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, so that they may live in their own place and not be moved again [nor tremble with fear]; and the 
1CH.17.10	since the time that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel. And I will humble 
1CH.17.10	“
1CH.17.11	And it shall come to pass that when your days are completed and you must go to be with your fathers [in death], I will raise up 
1CH.17.12	He shall build Me a house, and I will establish his throne forever. 
1CH.17.13	I will be his father and he shall be My son; and I will not take My steadfast love 
1CH.17.14	But I will settle 
1CH.17.15	According to all these words and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.
1CH.17.16	Then David the king went in and sat before the L
1CH.17.17	This was a small thing in Your eyes, O God; but You have spoken of Your servant’s house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the standard 
1CH.17.18	What more can David say to You for the honor 
1CH.17.19	O L
1CH.17.20	O L
1CH.17.21	And what one nation on the earth is like Your people Israel, whom God went to redeem for Himself as a people, to make a name for Yourself by great and awesome 
1CH.17.22	You made Your people Israel Your own people forever, and You, L
1CH.17.23	“Therefore now, O L
1CH.17.24	Let Your name [and the character that it denotes] endure and be magnified forever, saying, ‘The L

1CH.17.26	And now, O L
1CH.17.27	Therefore may it please You to bless the house (descendants) of Your servant, that it may continue before You forever; for what You bless, O L
1CH.18.1	After this it came about that David defeated and subdued the Philistines, and he took Gath and its villages out of the hand of the Philistines. 
1CH.18.2	He defeated Moab, and the Moabites became David’s servants and brought tribute (gifts).
1CH.18.3	David also defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah 
1CH.18.4	David took from him 1,000 chariots, 7,000 horsemen, and 20,000 foot soldiers (infantrymen). David also 
1CH.18.5	When the Arameans (Syrians) of 
1CH.18.6	Then David put 
1CH.18.7	David took the shields of gold which were carried by the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem. 
1CH.18.8	Likewise from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David brought a very large amount of bronze, with which Solomon later made the bronze Sea (large basin), the pillars, and the utensils of bronze.
1CH.18.9	When Tou king of Hamath heard how David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah, 
1CH.18.10	he sent Hadoram his son to King David to greet him and to bless (congratulate) him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and had defeated him; for Hadadezer had been at war with Tou. And 
1CH.18.11	King David also dedicated these to the L
1CH.18.12	Also Abishai the son of Zeruiah [David’s half sister] defeated 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 
1CH.18.13	He put military outposts in Edom, and all the Edomites became David’s servants. Thus the L
1CH.18.14	So David reigned over all Israel and administered justice and righteousness for all his people. 
1CH.18.15	Joab the son of Zeruiah was in command of the army, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder; 
1CH.18.16	Zadok the son of Ahitub and Abimelech the son of Abiathar were the priests, and Shavsha was secretary (state scribe); 
1CH.18.17	and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was in charge of the 
1CH.19.1	Now it came about after this, that Nahash king of the Ammonites died, and his son became king in his place. 
1CH.19.2	David said, “I will be kind (gracious) to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father was kind to me.” So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning [the death of] his father. And the servants of David came to the land of the Ammonites to comfort Hanun. 
1CH.19.3	But the leaders of the Ammonites said to Hanun, “
1CH.19.4	Therefore Hanun took David’s servants, shaved them [cutting off half their beards], and cut off their garments in the middle as far as their buttocks, and sent them away [in humiliation]. 
1CH.19.5	When David was told how the men were treated, he sent 
1CH.19.6	When the Ammonites saw that they had made themselves hateful to David, Hanun and his people sent 1,000 talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, Aram-maacah, and Zobah. 
1CH.19.7	So they hired for themselves 32,000 chariots and the king of Maacah and his troops, who came and camped before Medeba. And the Ammonites gathered together from their cities and came to battle. 
1CH.19.8	When David heard 
1CH.19.9	The Ammonites came out and lined up in battle formation at the entrance of the city [Medeba], while the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.
1CH.19.10	Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him in the front and in the rear, he chose 
1CH.19.11	The rest of the soldiers he placed in the hand of Abishai his brother, and they lined up against the Ammonites. 
1CH.19.12	He said, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I will help you. 
1CH.19.13	Be strong and let us show ourselves courageous for the sake of our people and for the cities of our God; and may the L
1CH.19.14	So Joab and the people who were with him approached the Arameans for battle, and they fled before him. 
1CH.19.15	When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans fled, they also fled before Abishai, Joab’s brother, and entered the city [Medeba]. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
1CH.19.16	When the Arameans (Syrians) saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the [Euphrates] River, with Shophach the commander of the army of Hadadezer leading them. 
1CH.19.17	When this was told to David, he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan, and came upon them and drew up in formation against them. So when David drew up in battle array against the Arameans, they fought against him. 
1CH.19.18	But the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed of the Arameans 7,000 charioteers and 40,000 foot soldiers, and put to death Shophach the commander of the army. 
1CH.19.19	When the servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to 
1CH.20.1	Then it happened at the end of the year, 
1CH.20.2	David took the crown of their king from his head and found that it 
1CH.20.3	He brought out the people who were in it, and 
1CH.20.4	Now it came about after this that war broke out at Gezer with the Philistines; then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the 
1CH.20.5	There was war again with the Philistines, and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. 
1CH.20.6	Again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of 
1CH.20.7	When he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed him. 
1CH.20.8	These were descended from the giants in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.
1CH.21.1	Satan [the adversary] stood up against Israel and incited David to 
1CH.21.2	So David said to Joab and the leaders of the people, “Go, count Israel from Beersheba to Dan, and bring me their total, so that I may know it.” 
1CH.21.3	Joab said, “May the L
1CH.21.4	But the king’s word prevailed over Joab. So Joab left and went throughout all Israel and came to Jerusalem. 
1CH.21.5	Then Joab gave the total of the census of the people to David. And all Israel were 1,100,000 men who drew the sword; and in Judah 470,000 men who drew the sword. 
1CH.21.6	But he did not count Levi and Benjamin among them, because the king’s order was detestable to Joab.
1CH.21.7	Now God was displeased with this act [of arrogance and pride], and He struck Israel. 
1CH.21.8	Then David said to God, “I have sinned greatly because I have done this thing. But now, I beseech You, take away the wickedness 
1CH.21.9	And the L
1CH.21.10	“Go and tell David, saying, ‘Thus says the L
1CH.21.11	So Gad came to David and said to him, “Thus says the L

1CH.21.13	David said to Gad, “I am in great distress; please let me fall into the hands of the L
1CH.21.14	So the L
1CH.21.15	God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it; and as he was destroying it, the L
1CH.21.16	Then David raised his eyes and saw the angel of the L
1CH.21.17	David said to God, “Is it not I who commanded the people to be counted? I am the one who has sinned and done evil; but as for these sheep [the people of Israel], what have they done? O L
1CH.21.18	Then the angel of the L
1CH.21.19	So David went up at Gad’s word, which he spoke in the name of the L
1CH.21.20	Now Ornan was threshing wheat, and he turned back and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. 
1CH.21.21	As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw him, and went out from the threshing floor and bowed down before David with his face to the ground. 
1CH.21.22	Then David said to Ornan, “Give me the site of this threshing floor, so that I may build an altar on it to the L
1CH.21.23	Ornan said to David, “Take it for yourself; and let my lord the king do what is good in his eyes. See, I will give you the oxen also for burnt offerings and the threshing sledges (heavy wooden platforms) for wood and the wheat for the grain offering; I give it all.” 
1CH.21.24	But King David said to Ornan, “No, I will certainly pay the full price; for I will not take what is yours for the L
1CH.21.25	So David gave Ornan 600 shekels of gold by weight for the site. 
1CH.21.26	Then David built an altar to the L

1CH.22.1	Then David said, “This is the house of the L
1CH.22.2	So David gave orders to gather the foreigners who were in the land of Israel, and he assigned stonecutters to hew out stones to build the house of God. 
1CH.22.3	David prepared large quantities of iron to make nails for the doors of the gates and for the clamps (trusses), and more bronze than could be weighed; 
1CH.22.4	and cedar trees beyond number, for the Sidonians and Tyrians brought large quantities of cedar timber to David. 
1CH.22.5	David said, “Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for the L
1CH.22.6	Then he called for Solomon his son and ordered him to build a house for the L

1CH.22.10	He shall build a house for My Name (Presence). He shall be My son and I will be his father; and I will establish his royal throne over Israel forever.’

1CH.23.1	When David reached old age, he made his son Solomon king over Israel. 
1CH.23.2	And he assembled together all the leaders of Israel with the priests and Levites.
1CH.23.3	The Levites thirty years old and upward were counted, and their number man by man was 38,000. 
1CH.23.4	Of these 
1CH.23.5	and 4,000 were gatekeepers, and 4,000 [musicians] were to praise the L
1CH.23.6	And David organized them into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
1CH.23.7	Of the Gershonites: Ladan (Libni) and Shimei. 
1CH.23.8	The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the first and Zetham and Joel—three 
1CH.23.9	The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran—three 
1CH.23.10	The sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina (Zizah), Jeush, and Beriah. These were the four sons of Shimei. 
1CH.23.11	Jahath was the first and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons [not enough for a father’s house or clan], so they were [counted together] as one father’s household, one working group.
1CH.23.12	The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel—four 
1CH.23.13	The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron was set apart to consecrate him as most holy, he and his sons forever, to burn incense before the L
1CH.23.14	But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were counted among the tribe of Levi. 
1CH.23.15	The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer. 
1CH.23.16	The son of Gershom: Shebuel the chief. 
1CH.23.17	The son of Eliezer was Rehabiah the chief. Eliezer had no other sons, but Rehabiah’s sons were very many [in number].

1CH.23.20	The sons of Uzziel: Micah the first and Isshiah the second.
1CH.23.21	The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.

1CH.23.23	The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth—three 
1CH.23.24	These were the Levites by their fathers’ households, the heads of the fathers’ 
1CH.23.25	For David said, “The L
1CH.23.26	Also, the Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all its utensils for its service.” 
1CH.23.27	For by the last words of David, the Levites from twenty years old and above were counted. 
1CH.23.28	For their duty is to assist [the priests] the sons of Aaron in the service of the house of the L
1CH.23.29	and with the showbread, and the fine flour for a grain offering, and unleavened wafers, or 
1CH.23.30	They are to stand every morning to thank and praise the L

1CH.24.3	David, with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their offices for their 
1CH.24.4	Since there were more chief men found among the descendants of Eleazar than among the descendants of Ithamar [because of Eli’s misfortunes, and Saul’s massacre of the priests at Nob], they were divided in this way: sixteen heads of fathers’ households of the descendants of Eleazar and eight of the descendants of Ithamar, corresponding to their fathers’ households. 
1CH.24.5	So they were divided by lot, one group with the other; for they were officers of the sanctuary and officers (high priests) of God, both from the descendants of Eleazar and from the descendants of Ithamar. 
1CH.24.6	Shemaiah, the son of Nethanel the scribe, from the Levites, recorded them in the presence of the king, the officers, Zadok the priest,

1CH.28.17	and the forks, the basins, and the pitchers of pure gold; and for the golden bowls with the weight for each bowl; and for the silver bowls with the weight for each bowl;

1CH.28.20	Then David said to his son Solomon, “Be strong and courageous, and take action; do not fear nor be dismayed, for the L
1CH.28.21	And see, [you have] the divisions of the priests and Levites for all the service of God’s house, and every willing, skillful man will be with you in all the kinds of work for any kind of service. Also the officers and all the people will be entirely at your command.”
1CH.29.1	And King David said to all the assembly, “My son Solomon, whom alone God has chosen, is still young and inexperienced and the work is great; for the 
1CH.29.2	So with all my ability I have provided for the house of my God the gold for the 
1CH.29.3	Moreover, because I delight in the house of my God, the [personal] treasure that I have of gold and silver, I give to the house of my God, in addition to all that I have already provided for the holy house: 
1CH.29.4	, 3,000 talents of gold from the gold of Ophir, and 7,000 talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the buildings; 
1CH.29.5	gold for the 
1CH.29.6	Then the rulers of the fathers’ 
1CH.29.7	and gave for the service of the house of God: 5,000 talents and 10,000 darics of gold, and 10,000 talents of silver, and 18,000 talents of bronze, and 100,000 talents of iron. 
1CH.29.8	Whoever had 
1CH.29.9	Then the people rejoiced because they had given willingly, for with a whole 
1CH.29.10	Therefore David blessed the L
1CH.29.11	Yours, O L
1CH.29.12	Both riches and honor 
1CH.29.13	Now therefore, our God, we thank You, and praise Your glorious name.
1CH.29.14	“But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to offer as generously as this? For all things come from You, and from Your own hand we have given to You. 
1CH.29.15	For we are 
1CH.29.16	O L
1CH.29.17	I know also, my God, that You test the heart and delight in uprightness 
1CH.29.18	O L
1CH.29.19	and give to my son Solomon a perfect heart to keep Your commandments, Your testimonies, and Your statutes, and to do all [that is necessary] to build the temple [for You], for which I have made provision.”
1CH.29.20	Then David said to all the assembly, “Now bless (praise, thank) the L
1CH.29.21	The next day they offered sacrifices and burnt offerings to the L
1CH.29.22	They ate and drank that day before the L
1CH.29.23	Then Solomon sat on the throne of the L
1CH.29.24	All of the leaders and warriors, and also all the sons of King David, pledged allegiance to King Solomon. 
1CH.29.25	The L
1CH.29.26	Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. 
1CH.29.27	The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
1CH.29.28	He died in a good old age [his seventy-first year], full of days (satisfied), riches and honor. Solomon his son reigned in his place. 
1CH.29.29	Now the acts of King David, from first to last, are written in the chronicles (records) of Samuel the seer, in the chronicles of Nathan the prophet, and in the chronicles of Gad the seer, 
1CH.29.30	with [accounts of] all his reign, and his power, and the times 
2CH.1.1	Solomon the son of David established himself securely over his kingdom, and the L
2CH.1.2	Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds and to the judges and to every leader in all Israel, the heads of the fathers’ (ancestors’) 
2CH.1.3	Then Solomon and all the assembly went to the high place at Gibeon [to offer sacrifices, where the Canaanites had habitually worshiped], for God’s Tent of Meeting was there, which Moses the servant of the L
2CH.1.4	But David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place he had prepared for it, because he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem. 
2CH.1.5	Now the bronze altar, which Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was there before the tabernacle of the L
2CH.1.6	And Solomon went up to the bronze altar before the L
2CH.1.7	That night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, “Ask what I shall give to you.”
2CH.1.8	Then Solomon said to God, “You have shown great lovingkindness 
2CH.1.9	Now, O L
2CH.1.10	Give me wisdom and knowledge, so that I may go out and come in [performing my duties] before this people, for [otherwise] who can rule 
2CH.1.11	God replied to Solomon, “Because this was in your heart and you did not ask for riches, possessions or honor 
2CH.1.12	wisdom and knowledge have been granted you. I will also give you riches, possessions, and honor, such as none of the kings who were before you has possessed nor will those who will come after you.” 
2CH.1.13	So Solomon went from the high place at Gibeon, from the Tent of Meeting, to Jerusalem. And he reigned over Israel.
2CH.1.14	Solomon acquired chariots and horsemen; he had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, and he stationed them in the cities [suited for the use] of chariots and with the king at Jerusalem. 
2CH.1.15	The king made silver and gold as plentiful 
2CH.1.16	Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from 
2CH.1.17	And they imported chariots from Egypt for 600 
2CH.2.2	So Solomon assigned 70,000 men to carry loads, 80,000 men to quarry stone in the mountains, and 3,600 to supervise them.
2CH.2.3	Then Solomon sent 
2CH.2.4	Observe, I am about to build a house for the Name of the L
2CH.2.5	The house I am going to build will be great, for our God is greater than all the gods. 
2CH.2.6	But who is able to build a house for Him, since the heavens and [even] the highest heavens cannot contain Him? Who am I to build a house for Him, except [as a place] to burn 
2CH.2.7	Now send me a man who is skilled to work in gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue 
2CH.2.8	Send me also cedar, cypress, and 
2CH.2.9	to prepare for me an abundance of timber, because the house I am about to build will be great and wonderful. 
2CH.2.10	And I will give to your servants who cut timber, 20,000 
2CH.2.11	Then Hiram, king of Tyre replied in a letter sent to Solomon: “Because the L
2CH.2.12	Hiram said also, “Blessed be the L
2CH.2.13	“Now I am sending a skilled man, endowed with understanding, Huram-abi, 
2CH.2.14	the son of a 
2CH.2.15	Now then, let my lord send to his servants the wheat, the barley, the oil, and the wine of which he has spoken. 
2CH.2.16	We will cut whatever timber you need from Lebanon and bring it to you on rafts by sea to Joppa, so that you may take it up to Jerusalem.”
2CH.2.17	Then Solomon took a count of all the aliens in the land of Israel, like the census that his father David had taken; and they were found to be 153,600. 
2CH.2.18	He assigned 70,000 of them to carry loads and 80,000 to quarry stone in the mountain, and 3,600 as overseers to make the people work.
2CH.3.1	Then Solomon began to build the house of the L
2CH.3.2	Solomon began to build on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign.
2CH.3.3	Now this is the [measurement of the] foundation which Solomon laid for the house of God: the length in cubits—by the old standard of measure—was sixty cubits (90 ft.), and the width was twenty cubits (30 ft.). 
2CH.3.4	The porch in front of the house was as long as the width of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was 120 cubits. He overlaid it inside with pure gold. 
2CH.3.5	He overlaid the main room [the Holy Place] with cypress wood and overlaid it with fine gold, and decorated it with palm trees and chains. 
2CH.3.6	And he adorned the house with precious stones; and the gold was gold from Parvaim. 
2CH.3.7	He also overlaid the house [the Holy Place] with gold—the beams, the thresholds, and its walls and its doors; and he carved cherubim on the walls.
2CH.3.8	Now he made the room of the Holy of Holies: its length equaling the width of the house was twenty cubits, and its width was twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with 600 talents of fine gold. 
2CH.3.9	The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He also overlaid the upper rooms with gold.
2CH.3.10	And in the Holy of Holies he made two sculptured cherubim, and overlaid them with gold. 
2CH.3.11	The wingspan of the cherubim was twenty cubits: one wing of one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house, and its other wing, of five cubits, touched the other cherub’s wing. 
2CH.3.12	The wing of the other cherub, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house; and its other wing of five cubits touched the wing of the first cherub. 
2CH.3.13	The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits. The cherubim stood on their feet, their faces toward the Holy Place (the main room). 
2CH.3.14	He made the veil [between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies] of blue, purple, and crimson colors, and 
2CH.3.15	He also made two pillars for the front of the house, thirty-five cubits high, and the capital on the top of each one was five cubits. 
2CH.3.16	He made chains [like a necklace] in the inner sanctuary and put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains. 
2CH.3.17	He erected the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right, the other on the left, and named the one on the right Jachin (may He establish) and the one on the left Boaz (in Him is strength).
2CH.4.1	Then Solomon made an altar of bronze, twenty cubits in length, twenty cubits in width, and ten cubits in height. 
2CH.4.2	He also made the Sea [that is, the large basin used for ceremonial washing] of cast metal, ten cubits from brim to brim, circular in form, and five cubits in height, and its circumference was thirty cubits. 
2CH.4.3	Under it and entirely encircling it were figures of oxen, ten to a cubit. The oxen were in two rows, cast in one piece. 
2CH.4.4	It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, three facing east; and the Sea was set on top of them and all their hindquarters turned inward. 
2CH.4.5	It was a handbreadth (the width of the four fingers) thick; its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It could hold 
2CH.4.6	He also made ten [portable] basins in which to wash, and he put five on the right (south) side and five on the left (north). They would rinse things for the burnt offering in them, but the Sea was for the priests to wash in.
2CH.4.7	And he made ten golden lampstands just as directed and set them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. 
2CH.4.8	He made also ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left side, and he made a hundred [ceremonial] basins of gold. 
2CH.4.9	Moreover, he made the courtyard of the priests, and the great courtyard [for the people] and doors for the courtyard, and he overlaid their doors with bronze. 
2CH.4.10	He set the Sea on the right side at the southeast corner [of the house].
2CH.4.11	And Huram also made the pails [for ashes], the shovels, and the basins. So Huram finished the work that he did for King Solomon in the house of God: 
2CH.4.12	the two pillars, the bowls, the capitals on top of the two pillars, and the two lattice works to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on top of the pillars, 
2CH.4.13	and the four hundred pomegranates for the two lattice works, two rows of pomegranates for each lattice to cover the two bowls of the capitals on the pillars. 
2CH.4.14	He also made the stands and he made the basins on the stands; 
2CH.4.15	and the one Sea with the twelve oxen under it. 
2CH.4.16	The pails, the shovels, and the meat-forks, and all the utensils Huram-abi made of polished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the L
2CH.4.17	The king cast them on the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah. 
2CH.4.18	Solomon made all these utensils in such great quantity that the weight of the bronze could not be determined.
2CH.4.19	Solomon also made all the articles that were in the house of God: the golden altar, and the tables for the bread of the Presence (showbread), 
2CH.4.20	and the lampstands with their lamps of pure gold, to burn in front of the inner sanctuary (the Holy of Holies) as directed; 
2CH.4.21	the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs of gold, of purest gold; 
2CH.4.22	and the snuffers, the basins, the dishes [for incense], and the firepans, of pure gold; and for the entrance of the house (temple), the inner doors for the Holy of Holies and the doors of the Holy Place (main room), were of gold.
2CH.5.1	Thus all the work that Solomon did for the house of the L
2CH.5.2	Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the fathers’ 
2CH.5.3	All the men of Israel gathered before the king at the feast in the seventh month. 
2CH.5.4	And all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark. 
2CH.5.5	The Levitical priests brought up the ark, the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy utensils that were in the Tent. 
2CH.5.6	And King Solomon and all the assembly of Israel who gathered together with him before the ark were sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered. 
2CH.5.7	Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the L
2CH.5.8	for the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, making a covering above the ark and its carrying poles. 
2CH.5.9	The poles were so long that the ends of the poles of the ark were visible from the front of the Holy of Holies (inner sanctuary), but were not visible from the outside. They are there to this day. 
2CH.5.10	There was nothing in the ark except 
2CH.5.11	When the priests came out of the Holy Place (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves [separating themselves from everything unclean], without regard to their 
2CH.5.12	and all of the Levitical singers, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, with their sons and relatives, clothed in fine linen, with cymbals, harps, and lyres were standing at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests blowing trumpets 
2CH.5.13	in unison when the trumpeters and singers were to make themselves heard with one voice praising and thanking the L
2CH.5.14	so that the priests could not remain standing to minister because of the cloud; for the glory 
2CH.6.1	Then Solomon said,
2CH.6.1	“The L
2CH.6.2	I have built You a lofty house,
2CH.6.2	A place for You to dwell forever.”
2CH.6.3	Then the king turned around and blessed the entire assembly of Israel, while they were all standing. 
2CH.6.4	And he said, “Blessed be the L
2CH.6.5	‘Since the day that I brought My people out of the land of Egypt, I did not choose a city among all the tribes of Israel 
2CH.6.6	but I have chosen Jerusalem that My Name might be there, and I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.’ 
2CH.6.7	Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a house for the Name of the L
2CH.6.8	But the L
2CH.6.9	Nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who will be born to you, he shall build the house for My Name.’ 
2CH.6.10	Now the L
2CH.6.11	There I have placed the ark [the symbol of His Presence] in which is the covenant of the L
2CH.6.12	Then Solomon stood before the altar of the L
2CH.6.13	For Solomon had made a bronze platform, five cubits square and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the courtyard; and he stood on it, and he knelt down on his knees in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven, 
2CH.6.14	and he said, “O L
2CH.6.15	[You] who have kept Your promise to Your servant David, my father, that which You told him; You have spoken with Your mouth and have fulfilled it with Your hand, as it is today. 
2CH.6.16	Now therefore, O L

2CH.6.29	then whatever prayer or request is made by any man or all of Your people Israel, each knowing his own suffering and his own pain, and stretching out his hands toward this house, 
2CH.6.30	then hear from heaven, Your dwelling place, and forgive, and render to each 
2CH.6.31	so that they may fear You, to walk in Your ways [in obedience to You] as long as they live in the land which You have given to our fathers.
2CH.6.32	“Also in regard to the foreigner who is not from Your people Israel, but has come from a far country for the sake of Your great name and Your mighty power and Your outstretched arm—when they come and pray toward this house, 
2CH.6.33	then hear from heaven, from Your dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You, so that all the peoples of the earth may know Your name, and fear You [reverently and worshipfully], as

2CH.7.1	When Solomon had finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the [

2CH.7.5	King Solomon offered a sacrifice of 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. In this way the king and all the people dedicated God’s house. 
2CH.7.6	The priests stood at their posts [ready for service], and the Levites also, with the musical instruments of the L
2CH.7.7	Moreover, Solomon consecrated the middle of the courtyard that was in front of the house of the L
2CH.7.8	At that time Solomon observed the feast for seven days, and all Israel with him, a very large assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt. 
2CH.7.9	On the eighth day they held a celebration, for they had observed the dedication of the altar for seven days, and the feast for seven days. 
2CH.7.10	And on the twenty-third day of the seventh month Solomon sent the people to their tents, rejoicing and happy in heart because of the goodness that the L

2CH.7.15	Now My eyes will be open and My ears attentive to prayer

2CH.8.4	He built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all his storage cities in Hamath. 
2CH.8.5	He also built upper Beth-horon and lower Beth-horon, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars [to lock the gates]; 
2CH.8.6	and Baalath and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land under his rule.
2CH.8.7	All the people who were left of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel, 
2CH.8.8	 descendants of those who were left in the land, whom the Israelites had not destroyed—Solomon brought them up as forced laborers to this day. 
2CH.8.9	But Solomon did not make slaves of the Israelites for his work; they were men of war, his chief captains, and commanders of his chariots and his horsemen. 
2CH.8.10	These were the chief officers of King Solomon, two hundred and fifty [in authority] who ruled over the people.
2CH.8.11	Then Solomon brought the daughter of Pharaoh up from the City of David into the house (palace) he had built for her, for he said, “My wife shall not live in the house of David king of Israel, because the places where the ark of the L

2CH.8.13	a certain number every day, offering them up as Moses commanded for the Sabbaths, the New Moons, and the three annual feasts—the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Booths (Tabernacles).
2CH.8.14	Now in accordance with the ordinance of his father David, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service, and the Levites for their duties of praise and ministering 
2CH.8.15	And they did not deviate from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites in any respect or in regard to the storehouses 
2CH.8.16	Thus all the work of Solomon was carried out from the day the foundation of the house of the L
2CH.8.17	Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Eloth on the shore of the [Red] Sea in the land of Edom. 
2CH.8.18	And Huram (Hiram) sent him, by his servants, ships and servants familiar with the sea; and they went with Solomon’s servants to Ophir, and took from there four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to King Solomon.
2CH.9.1	When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to Jerusalem to test Solomon with riddles. She was accompanied by a very large number of attendants, with camels bearing spices (balsam oil) and a large amount of gold and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon, she talked with him about all that was on her mind. 
2CH.9.2	Solomon 
2CH.9.3	So when the queen of Sheba saw the [depth of] Solomon’s wisdom, and the house which he had built, 
2CH.9.4	and the food of his table, the [vast] seating order of his officials, the attendance 
2CH.9.5	She said to the king, “The report which I heard in my own land regarding your [accomplishments and your] words and your wisdom was true, 
2CH.9.6	but I did not believe the reports until I came and saw it with my own eyes. Behold, the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told to me; you have surpassed the report that I heard. 
2CH.9.7	Blessed 
2CH.9.8	Blessed be the L
2CH.9.9	Then she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, a very large

2CH.9.11	From the almug timber the king made 
2CH.9.12	King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all [the things] she desired, whatever she asked, 
2CH.9.13	Now the weight of gold which came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents, 
2CH.9.14	besides what the traders and merchants brought; and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon. 
2CH.9.15	King Solomon made two hundred large shields of beaten gold, using six hundred 
2CH.9.16	And 
2CH.9.17	Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold. 
2CH.9.18	 six steps to the throne and a golden footstool attached to the throne, and arms on each side of the seat, with two lions standing beside the arms. 
2CH.9.19	Also, twelve lions were standing there, one on each side of the six steps. Nothing like it had ever been made for any [other] kingdom. 
2CH.9.20	All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; silver was not considered valuable in the days of Solomon. 
2CH.9.21	For the king’s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years the ships of Tarshish came bringing gold and silver, ivory and apes and peacocks.
2CH.9.22	So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in wealth and wisdom. 
2CH.9.23	And all the kings of the earth were seeking the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom which God had put into his heart. 
2CH.9.24	Each man brought his gift, articles of silver and gold, garments, weapons, spices, horses and mules, so much year by year.
2CH.9.25	Now Solomon had 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots, and 12,000 horsemen, and he stationed them in the chariot cities or with the king at Jerusalem. 
2CH.9.26	He ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines, and as far as the border of Egypt. 
2CH.9.27	The king made silver in Jerusalem 
2CH.9.28	And they were importing horses for Solomon from Egypt and from all [the other] countries.
2CH.9.29	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, from the first to the last, are they not written in the records of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat? 
2CH.9.30	Solomon reigned forty years in Jerusalem over all Israel.
2CH.9.31	And Solomon slept with his fathers [in death]; he was buried in the city of his father David. Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.
2CH.10.1	Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, because all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. 
2CH.10.2	When Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard 
2CH.10.3	And the people sent 
2CH.10.4	“Your father [King Solomon] made our yoke hard (heavy, difficult); so now lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us, and we will serve you.” 
2CH.10.5	Rehoboam replied, “Come back to me again in three days.” So the people departed.
2CH.10.6	Then King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon [as advisers] while he was alive, asking, “What advice do you give me in answer to these people?” 
2CH.10.7	They answered him, saying, “If you are kind to these people and please them and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.” 
2CH.10.8	But the king rejected the advice which the elders gave him, and consulted with the young men who grew up with him and served him [as advisers]. 
2CH.10.9	He asked them, “What advice do you give to us regarding the answer to these people, who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten the yoke which your father put on us’? ” 
2CH.10.10	The young men who grew up with him told him, “Tell the people who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter for us’: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s 
2CH.10.11	Now my father loaded you with a heavy yoke, but I will add [more weight] to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I 
2CH.10.12	So on the third day Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam just as the king had directed, saying, “Return to me on the third day.” 
2CH.10.13	The king answered them harshly, for King Rehoboam rejected the counsel of the elders. 
2CH.10.14	He spoke to them in accordance with the advice of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father disciplined you with whips, but I 
2CH.10.15	So the king did not listen to the people, for the 
2CH.10.16	When all Israel saw that the king did not listen 
2CH.10.16	“What portion do we have in David?
2CH.10.16	Every man to your tents, O Israel;
2CH.10.16	Now, [Rehoboam, descendant of] David, see to your own house.”
2CH.10.16	So all Israel went to their tents. 
2CH.10.17	But as for the Israelites who lived in Judah’s cities, Rehoboam ruled over them. 
2CH.10.18	Then King Rehoboam 
2CH.10.19	And Israel has rebelled against the house of David to this day.
2CH.11.1	Now when Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, 180,000 chosen warriors to fight against [the ten tribes of] Israel to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam. 
2CH.11.2	But the word of the L
2CH.11.3	“Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, 
2CH.11.4	‘Thus says the L
2CH.11.5	Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and built [fortified] cities for defense in Judah. 
2CH.11.6	He 
2CH.11.7	Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam, 
2CH.11.8	Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 
2CH.11.9	Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 
2CH.11.10	Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which are fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin. 
2CH.11.11	He strengthened the fortresses and put officers in them, with supplies of food, [olive] oil, and wine. 
2CH.11.12	And in each city he put [large] shields and spears, and made them very strong. So he held Judah and Benjamin.
2CH.11.13	Further, the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel took their stand with Rehoboam from all their districts.
2CH.11.14	For the Levites left their pasture lands and their property and came to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had excluded them from serving as priests to the L
2CH.11.15	Jeroboam appointed his own priests for the high places, for the satyrs (goat demons) and calves (idols) which he had made. 
2CH.11.16	Those from all the tribes of Israel who set their hearts on seeking the L
2CH.11.17	So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam the son of Solomon for three years; for they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years.
2CH.11.18	Rehoboam took as his wife Mahalath, the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse. 
2CH.11.19	She bore him sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham. 
2CH.11.20	After her he took Maacah the daughter (granddaughter) of Absalom, and she bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. 
2CH.11.21	Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter (granddaughter) of Absalom more than all his wives and 
2CH.11.22	Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah the chief leader among his brothers, because he 
2CH.11.23	He acted wisely and distributed some of his sons throughout the territories of Judah and Benjamin to all the fortified cities. He gave them abundant provisions, and he sought many wives 
2CH.12.1	When the kingdom of Rehoboam was established and strong, he and all Israel with him abandoned the law of the L
2CH.12.2	And it came about in King Rehoboam’s fifth year, because they had been unfaithful to the L
2CH.12.3	with 1,200 chariots and 60,000 horsemen. The people who came with him from Egypt were beyond counting—the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the 
2CH.12.4	Shishak took the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem. 
2CH.12.5	Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, “Thus says the L
2CH.12.6	Then the leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, “The L
2CH.12.7	When the L
2CH.12.8	Nevertheless they will become his slaves, so that they may know [the difference between] My service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.”
2CH.12.9	So Shishak king of Egypt went up against Jerusalem; he took the treasures of the house of the L
2CH.12.10	In their place King Rehoboam made shields of bronze and entrusted them to the care of the officers of the guard who guarded the door of the king’s house. 
2CH.12.11	And whenever the king entered the house of the L
2CH.12.12	When Rehoboam humbled himself, the wrath of the L
2CH.12.13	So King Rehoboam established himself in Jerusalem and reigned. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city in which the L
2CH.12.14	He did evil because he did not set his heart to seek 
2CH.12.15	Now the acts of Rehoboam, from the first to the last, are they not written in the records of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, according to genealogical enrollment? 
2CH.12.16	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers [in death] and was buried in the City of David; and Abijah his son became king in his place.
2CH.13.1	In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah became king over Judah. 
2CH.13.2	He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah.
2CH.13.3	Abijah began the battle with an army of brave soldiers, 400,000 chosen men. Jeroboam drew up in battle formation against him with 800,000 chosen men, valiant men.
2CH.13.4	Then Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, “Listen to me, Jeroboam and all Israel: 
2CH.13.5	Do you not know that the L
2CH.13.6	Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his lord [the king], 
2CH.13.7	and worthless (unprincipled, unethical) men gathered around him, useless 
2CH.13.8	“And now you intend to assert yourselves against the kingdom of the L
2CH.13.9	Have you not driven out the priests of the L
2CH.13.10	But as for us, the L
2CH.13.11	Every morning and every evening they offer the burnt offerings and the fragrant incense to the L
2CH.13.12	Behold, God is with us at our head, and His priests [are here] with their signal trumpets to sound an alarm against you. O sons of Israel, do not fight against the L
2CH.13.13	But Jeroboam had set an ambush to come from the rear, so that Israel was in front of Judah and the ambush was behind them. 
2CH.13.14	When [the men of] Judah turned around, they were attacked from both front and rear; so they cried out to the L
2CH.13.15	Then the men of Judah raised a war cry; and as they shouted, God struck Jeroboam and all Israel [with defeat] before Abijah and Judah. 
2CH.13.16	And the sons of Israel fled before Judah, and God handed over the sons of Israel to them. 
2CH.13.17	Abijah and his people inflicted on them a great defeat, so that 500,000 chosen men of Israel fell slain. 
2CH.13.18	Thus the sons of Israel were subdued (humbled) at that time, and the sons of Judah prevailed because they relied on the L
2CH.13.19	Abijah pursued Jeroboam and captured [several] cities from him: Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephraim (Ephron), with their villages.
2CH.13.20	Jeroboam did not recover strength again during the time of [the reign of] Abijah. And the L
2CH.13.21	But Abijah became powerful. He took fourteen wives for himself and fathered twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. 
2CH.13.22	Now the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways and his sayings, are written in the writing of the prophet Iddo.
2CH.14.3	He removed the foreign altars and high places and tore down the [pagan] pillars (obelisks, memorial stones), and cut to pieces the Asherim [the symbols of the goddess Asherah]. 
2CH.14.4	And he commanded Judah to seek the L
2CH.14.5	Asa also removed the [idolatrous] high places and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah. The kingdom was at rest 
2CH.14.6	He built fortified cities in Judah, since the land was at rest, and there was no one at war with him in those years, because the L
2CH.14.7	So he said to Judah, “Let us build these cities and surround them with walls, towers, gates and bars [to secure the doors]. The land is still ours because we have sought the L
2CH.14.8	Now Asa had an army of 300,000 men from Judah, who carried large shields and spears, and 280,000 from Benjamin, who carried shields and drew bows, all courageous men.
2CH.14.9	Now Zerah the Ethiopian (Cushite) came out against Judah with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots, and he came as far as Mareshah. 
2CH.14.10	Then Asa went out against him, and they drew up in battle formation in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. 
2CH.14.11	Asa called out to the L
2CH.14.12	So the L
2CH.14.13	Asa and the people who were with him pursued them as far as 
2CH.14.14	They attacked 
2CH.14.15	They also struck down the people [living] in tents who had livestock, and took captive large numbers of sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.15.1	Now the Spirit of God came on Azariah the son of Oded, 
2CH.15.2	and he went out to meet Asa and said to him, “Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: the L
2CH.15.3	Now for a long time Israel was without the true God and without a teaching priest, and without [God’s] law. 
2CH.15.4	But when they were in their trouble 
2CH.15.5	In those times there was no peace for him who went out or for him who came in, for great suffering came on all the inhabitants of the lands. 
2CH.15.6	Nation was crushed by nation, and city by city, for God troubled them with every kind of distress. 
2CH.15.7	But as for you, be strong and do not lose courage, for there is reward for your work.”
2CH.15.8	And when Asa heard these words, the prophecy of Azariah the son of Oded the prophet, he took courage and removed the repulsive idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities which he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim. Then he restored the altar [of burnt offering] of the L
2CH.15.9	He gathered all Judah and Benjamin and the strangers who were with them out of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon, for they came over to Asa from Israel in large numbers when they saw that the L
2CH.15.10	So they assembled at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign. 
2CH.15.11	They sacrificed to the L
2CH.15.12	They entered into a covenant (solemn agreement) to seek the L
2CH.15.13	and that whoever would not seek the L
2CH.15.14	They swore an oath to the L
2CH.15.15	All Judah rejoiced over the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and had sought Him with their whole heart, and He let them find Him. So the L
2CH.15.16	He also removed Maacah, King Asa’s mother, from 
2CH.15.17	But the high places [of pagan worship] were not removed from Israel. Nevertheless Asa’s heart was blameless all his days. 
2CH.15.18	He brought the things that his father [Abijah] had dedicated and those things that he had dedicated into the house of God—silver and gold and utensils. 
2CH.15.19	And there was no war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign.
2CH.16.1	In the 
2CH.16.2	Then Asa brought out silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of the L
2CH.16.3	“
2CH.16.4	Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they attacked 
2CH.16.5	When Baasha heard about it, he ceased fortifying Ramah and stopped his work. 
2CH.16.6	Then King Asa brought all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber with which Baasha had been building, and with them he fortified Geba and Mizpah.
2CH.16.7	At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him, “Because you relied on the king of Aram (Syria) and did not rely on the L
2CH.16.8	Were not the Ethiopians and Lubim a huge army with a great number of chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied on the L
2CH.16.9	For the eyes of the L
2CH.16.10	Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him in prison [in the stocks], for he was enraged with him because of this. And at the same time Asa oppressed some of the people.
2CH.16.11	Now the acts of Asa, from the first to the last, are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.16.12	In the 
2CH.16.13	So Asa slept with his fathers [in death], dying in the forty-first year of his reign. 
2CH.16.14	They buried him in his own tomb which he had cut out for himself in the City of David, and they laid him on a bier which he had filled with various kinds of spices blended by the perfumers’ art; and they made a very great fire in his honor.
2CH.17.1	Jehoshaphat his son then became king [of Judah] in Asa’s place, and strengthened his position over Israel. 
2CH.17.2	He placed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim which his father Asa had captured.
2CH.17.3	The L
2CH.17.4	but sought the God of his father, and walked in (obeyed) His commandments, and did not act as Israel did. 
2CH.17.5	Therefore the L
2CH.17.6	His heart was encouraged 
2CH.17.7	Then in the third year of his reign he sent his officials, Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah; 
2CH.17.8	and with them were the Levites—Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah; and with them the priests Elishama and Jehoram. 
2CH.17.9	They taught in Judah 
2CH.17.10	Now the dread of the L
2CH.17.11	Some of the Philistines brought gifts and silver as tribute to Jehoshaphat; the Arabians also brought him flocks: 7,700 rams and 7,700 male goats. 
2CH.17.12	So Jehoshaphat became greater and greater. He built fortresses and storage cities in Judah. 
2CH.17.13	He had large supplies in the cities of Judah, and soldiers, courageous men, in Jerusalem. 
2CH.17.14	This was the number of them by their fathers’ (ancestors’) households: of Judah, the commanders of thousands, Adnah the commander, and with him 300,000 courageous men; 
2CH.17.15	and next to him was Jehohanan the commander, and with him 280,000; 
2CH.17.16	and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who volunteered for the L
2CH.17.17	and of Benjamin: Eliada, a brave man, and with him 200,000 men armed with bow and shield; 
2CH.17.18	and next to him was Jehozabad, and with him 180,000 armed 
2CH.17.19	These are the ones who were in the service of the king, besides those he had placed in fortified cities throughout Judah.
2CH.18.1	Now Jehoshaphat had great wealth and honor, and was allied by 
2CH.18.2	Some years later he went down to [visit] Ahab in Samaria. And Ahab slaughtered many sheep and oxen for him and the people who were with him, and induced him to go up against Ramoth-gilead. 
2CH.18.3	Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me to [fight against] Ramoth-gilead?” He answered, “I am as you are, and my people as your people [your hopes and concerns are ours]; 
2CH.18.4	Further, Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire 
2CH.18.5	Then the king of Israel assembled the prophets, four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I refrain?” And they said, “Go up, for God will hand it over to the king.” 
2CH.18.6	But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there no prophet of the L
2CH.18.7	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is still one man by whom we may inquire of the L
2CH.18.8	Then the king of Israel called for an officer and said, “Bring Micaiah the son of Imla quickly.” 
2CH.18.9	Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting, each on his throne, arrayed in their robes; they were sitting at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them. 
2CH.18.10	Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made horns of iron for himself; and said, “Thus says the L
2CH.18.11	All the prophets prophesied this, saying, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and succeed; the L
2CH.18.12	The messenger who went to call Micaiah said to him, “Listen, the words of the prophets are of one accord, 
2CH.18.13	But Micaiah said, “As the L
2CH.18.14	When he came to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I refrain?” And he said, “Go up and succeed, for they will be handed over to you.” 
2CH.18.15	Then the king said to him, “How many times must I warn you (make you swear an oath) to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the L
2CH.18.16	Then Micaiah said,
2CH.18.16	“I saw all [the people of] Israel
2CH.18.16	Scattered on the mountains,
2CH.18.16	As sheep that have no shepherd;
2CH.18.16	And the L
2CH.18.16	‘These have no master.
2CH.18.16	Let each one return to his house in peace.’ ”
2CH.18.17	Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good in regard to me, but [only] evil?”
2CH.18.18	So Micaiah said, “Therefore, hear the word of the L
2CH.18.19	Then the L
2CH.18.20	Then a spirit came forward and stood before the L
2CH.18.21	He said, ‘I will go out and be a deceptive spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ Then the L
2CH.18.22	Now, you see, the L
2CH.18.23	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came up and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, “Which way did the Spirit of the L
2CH.18.24	Micaiah said, “Behold, you will see on that day when you go into an inner room [desperately trying] to hide yourself.” 
2CH.18.25	Then the king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son, 
2CH.18.26	and say, ‘Thus says the king: “Put this man in prison and feed him just enough bread and water to survive until I return in peace (safely).” ’ ” 
2CH.18.27	But Micaiah said, “If you actually return in peace, the L
2CH.18.28	So [Ahab] the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up against Ramoth-gilead. 
2CH.18.29	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “
2CH.18.30	Now the king of 
2CH.18.31	So when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat [of Judah], they said, “It is the king of Israel!” So they turned to fight against him, but Jehoshaphat called out [for God’s help], and the L
2CH.18.32	When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him. 
2CH.18.33	Then a certain man drew his bow at random and struck [Ahab] the king of Israel between the scales of 
2CH.18.34	The battle raged that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot in front of the Arameans (Syrians) until the evening, and at sunset he died.
2CH.19.1	Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned safely to his house (palace) in Jerusalem. 
2CH.19.2	Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to King Jehoshaphat, “Should you help the ungodly and love those who hate the L

2CH.19.4	So Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim and brought them back to the L
2CH.19.5	He appointed judges in the land in all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city, 
2CH.19.6	and he said to the judges, “Be careful what you do, for you do not judge for man, but for the L
2CH.19.7	So now let the fear (reverent awe) of the L
2CH.19.8	In Jerusalem also Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites, priests, and heads of the fathers’ 
2CH.19.9	Then the king commanded them, “Do this in the fear of the L

2CH.20.1	Now it happened after this that the Moabites and the Ammonites, together with some of the Meunites, came to make war against Jehoshaphat. 
2CH.20.2	Then it was reported to Jehoshaphat, “A great multitude has come against you from beyond the [Dead] Sea, out of

2CH.20.7	O our God, did You not drive out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel and give it forever to the descendants of Your friend Abraham? 
2CH.20.8	They have lived in it, and have built You a sanctuary in it for Your Name, saying, 
2CH.20.9	‘If evil comes on us, or the sword of judgment, or plague, or famine, we will stand before this house and before You (for Your Name 
2CH.20.10	Now behold, the sons of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom You would not allow Israel to invade when they came from the land of Egypt (for they turned away from them and did not destroy them), 
2CH.20.11	here they are, rewarding us by coming to drive us out of Your possession which You have given us as an inheritance. 
2CH.20.12	O our God, will You not judge them? For we are powerless against this great multitude which is coming against us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on You.”
2CH.20.13	So all Judah stood before the L
2CH.20.14	Then in the midst of the assembly the Spirit of the L
2CH.20.15	He said, “Listen carefully, all [you people of] Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and King Jehoshaphat. The L
2CH.20.16	Go down against them tomorrow. Behold, they will come up by the ascent of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the river valley, in front of the Wilderness of Jeruel. 
2CH.20.17	You 
2CH.20.18	Jehoshaphat bowed with his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the L
2CH.20.19	The Levites, from the sons of the Kohathites and the sons of the Korahites, stood up to praise the L
2CH.20.20	So they got up early in the morning and went out into the Wilderness of Tekoa; and as they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Hear me, O Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem! Believe 
2CH.20.21	When he had consulted with the people, he appointed those who sang to the L
2CH.20.22	When they began singing and praising, the L
2CH.20.23	For the sons of Ammon and Moab [suspecting betrayal] rose up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir, completely destroying them; and when they had finished with the inhabitants of Seir, they helped to destroy one another.
2CH.20.24	When [the men of] Judah came to the lookout tower of the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude, and behold, they were dead bodies lying on the ground, and no one had escaped. 
2CH.20.25	When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their spoil, they found much among them, 
2CH.20.26	Then on the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Beracah, for it was there that they blessed the L
2CH.20.27	Then they returned to Jerusalem with joy, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, led by Jehoshaphat, for the L
2CH.20.28	They came to Jerusalem with harps, lyres, and trumpets to the house (temple) of the L
2CH.20.29	And the fear of God came on all the kingdoms of those countries when they heard that the L
2CH.20.30	So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest on all sides.
2CH.20.31	Now Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for twenty-five years. His mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 
2CH.20.32	He walked in the way of his father Asa and did not depart from it, doing what was right in the sight of the L
2CH.20.33	Only the high places [for pagan sacrifices] were not removed, for the people had not yet set their hearts firmly on the God of their fathers.
2CH.20.34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, from the first to the last, behold, they are written in the records of Jehu the son of Hanani, which are recorded in the Book of the Kings of Israel.
2CH.20.35	After [all] this Jehoshaphat king of Judah made an alliance with Ahaziah king of Israel, and he acted wickedly in doing so. 
2CH.20.36	He joined him in building ships to go to Tarshish [for trade], and they built them in Ezion-geber. 
2CH.20.37	Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah, the L
2CH.21.1	Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers [in death] and was buried with them in the City of David; and his son Jehoram became king in his place. 
2CH.21.2	He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, 
2CH.21.3	Their father gave them many gifts of silver, gold, and valuable things, in addition to fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram because he was the firstborn.
2CH.21.4	When Jehoram had ascended over the kingdom of his father and made himself secure, he killed all his brothers with the sword [to eliminate any rivals], and some of the leaders of Israel as well. 
2CH.21.5	Jehoram was thirty-two years of age when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.21.6	He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done (for he married the daughter of Ahab), and he did what was evil in the sight of the L
2CH.21.7	Yet the L
2CH.21.8	In the days of Jehoram Edom revolted against the rule of Judah and set up a king over themselves. 
2CH.21.9	Then Jehoram crossed over [the Jordan River] with his commanders and all his chariots, and rose up by night and struck down the Edomites who were surrounding him and the commanders of the chariots. 
2CH.21.10	So Edom revolted against the rule of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time against Jehoram’s rule, because he had abandoned (turned away from) the L
2CH.21.11	Moreover, he made [idolatrous] high places in the hill country of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to be unfaithful [to God], and he led Judah astray [compelling the people’s cooperation].
2CH.21.12	Then a letter came to Jehoram from Elijah the prophet, saying, “Thus says the L
2CH.21.13	but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to be unfaithful [to God] as the house of Ahab was unfaithful, and you have also murdered your brothers, your father’s house (your own family), who were better than you, 
2CH.21.14	behold, the L
2CH.21.15	and you will suffer a severe illness, an intestinal disease, until your intestines come out because of the sickness, day after day.’ ”
2CH.21.16	Then the L
2CH.21.17	They came against Judah and invaded it, and carried away all the possessions found in the king’s house (palace), together with his sons and his wives; so there was not a son left to him except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.
2CH.21.18	After all this, the L
2CH.21.19	Now it came about in the course of time, at the end of two years, that his intestines came out because of his disease and he died in excruciating pain. And his people did not make a funeral fire 
2CH.21.20	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years; and he departed with no one’s regret (sorrow). They buried him in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
2CH.22.1	Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king in his place, because the band of men (raiders) who came with the Arabs to the camp had killed all the older 
2CH.22.2	Ahaziah was 
2CH.22.3	He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his adviser [and she encouraged him] to act wickedly. 
2CH.22.4	So he did evil in the sight of the L
2CH.22.5	He also walked in accordance with their advice, and he went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to wage war against Hazael king of Aram (Syria) at Ramoth-gilead. And the Arameans wounded 
2CH.22.6	Then he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds they had inflicted on him at Ramah when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. And 
2CH.22.7	But the downfall of Ahaziah was ordained by God, in that he went to Joram (Jehoram). For when he arrived there he went out [as an ally] with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the L
2CH.22.8	It came about that when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he found the leaders of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s [murdered] brothers ministering to Ahaziah, and he killed them. 
2CH.22.9	Jehu also searched for Ahaziah, who was hiding in Samaria; he was captured, brought to Jehu, and put to death. They buried him, for they said, “
2CH.22.10	Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she rose and destroyed all the royal family of the house of Judah. 
2CH.22.11	But Jehoshabeath, the king’s daughter, took Joash the [infant] son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the king’s sons who were being put to death, and she placed him and his nurse in the bedroom. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram [of Judah] and wife of Jehoiada the priest, hid Joash from [his grandmother] Athaliah so that she did not murder him (for Jehoshabeath was the sister of Ahaziah). 
2CH.22.12	Joash was hidden with them in the house (temple) of God for six years, and Athaliah reigned over the land.
2CH.23.1	In the seventh year Jehoiada [the priest] summoned his courage and took the captains of hundreds: Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Johanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, 
2CH.23.2	They went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of the 
2CH.23.3	Then all the assembly made a covenant in the house of God with the king [that is, with the child Joash, to overthrow Athaliah by proclaiming his sovereignty]. And Jehoiada [the priest] said to them, “Behold, the king’s son [Joash] shall reign, as the L
2CH.23.4	This is what you shall do: a third of you, of the priests and Levites who are resuming service on the Sabbath, shall be gatekeepers, 
2CH.23.5	a [second] third 
2CH.23.6	But let no one enter the house (temple) of the L
2CH.23.7	The Levites shall surround the [young] king, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes into the temple [breaking through the ranks of the guard to get near Joash] is to be killed. You are to be with the king when he comes in [from the temple chamber where he is hiding] and when he goes out.”
2CH.23.8	So the Levites and all Judah acted in accordance with everything that Jehoiada the priest had commanded; and every man took his men who were to resume duty on the Sabbath, with those who were to go off duty on the Sabbath, for Jehoiada the priest did not dismiss [any of] the divisions [from their duties]. 
2CH.23.9	Then Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and the large and small shields which had been King David’s, which were in the house of God. 
2CH.23.10	He stationed all the people around the king [as guards for him], every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side to the left side of the house (temple), by the altar and by the house. 
2CH.23.11	Then they brought out the king’s son and put the crown on him, and 
2CH.23.12	When Athaliah heard the sound of the people running and praising the king, she went into the house of the L
2CH.23.13	She looked, and there was the [young] king, standing by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpeters were beside him. And all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets, and the singers with their musical instruments were directing the [singing of] praise. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and cried, “Treason! Treason!” 
2CH.23.14	So Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were appointed over the army and said to them, “Bring her out between the ranks [of soldiers]; and whoever follows her shall be put to death with the sword.” For the priest had said, “Do not let her be put to death in the temple of the L
2CH.23.15	So they seized Athaliah, and when she arrived at the entrance of the Horse Gate of the king’s house (palace), they put her to death there.
2CH.23.16	Then Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, all the people, and the king, that they would be the L
2CH.23.17	Then all the people went to the house of Baal and tore it down, and they smashed its altars and its images to pieces, and killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars. 
2CH.23.18	Also Jehoiada placed the offices 
2CH.23.19	Jehoiada stationed the gatekeepers [at the gates] of the house of the L
2CH.23.20	He took the captains of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from the house of the L
2CH.23.21	So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet after Athaliah had been put to death with the sword.
2CH.24.1	Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned for forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibiah from Beersheba. 
2CH.24.2	Joash did what was right in the sight of the L
2CH.24.3	Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he fathered sons and daughters.
2CH.24.4	Now it came about after this that Joash decided to restore the house (temple) of the L
2CH.24.5	He gathered the priests and the Levites and said to them, “Go out to the cities of Judah and collect money from all Israel to repair the house of your God from year to year; and see that you do it quickly.” But the Levites did not act quickly. 
2CH.24.6	So the king called for Jehoiada the high 
2CH.24.7	For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken into the house of God and also had used all the holy 
2CH.24.8	So at the king’s command they made a chest and set it outside by the gate of the house of the L
2CH.24.9	Then they made a proclamation in Judah and Jerusalem to bring in for the L
2CH.24.10	All the officers and all the people rejoiced and brought their tax and dropped it into the chest until they had finished [and the chest was full]. 
2CH.24.11	It came about that whenever the Levites brought the chest to the king’s official, and whenever they saw that there was a large amount of money, the king’s secretary and the chief priest’s representative would come and empty the chest, and take it, and return it to its place. They did this day after day and collected a large amount of money. 
2CH.24.12	The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of the L
2CH.24.13	So the workmen labored, and the repair work progressed in their hands; and they restored 
2CH.24.14	When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada; and it was [melted down and] made into utensils for the house of the L
2CH.24.15	Now when Jehoiada grew old and was full of days, he died. He was a hundred and thirty years old at his death. 
2CH.24.16	They buried him in the City of David among the kings, because he had done good [things] in Israel and toward God and His house.
2CH.24.17	Now after the death of Jehoiada [the priest, who had hidden Joash], the officials of Judah came and 
2CH.24.18	They abandoned the house of the L
2CH.24.19	Yet God sent prophets among them to bring them back to the L
2CH.24.20	Then the Spirit of God came over Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, and he stood above the people and said to them, “This is what God has said: ‘Why do you transgress the commandments of the L
2CH.24.21	So they conspired against Zechariah and stoned him [to death] at the command of the king, in the courtyard of the house of the L
2CH.24.22	Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which Jehoiada, Zechariah’s father, had shown him, but he murdered his son. And when Zechariah was dying, he said, “May the L
2CH.24.23	Now it happened at the end of the year, that the army of Aram (Syria) went up against Joash. They came to Judah and Jerusalem and killed all the leaders among the people and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus. 
2CH.24.24	Though the army of the Arameans came with a small company of men, the L
2CH.24.25	When they left Joash (for they left him very ill), his own servants conspired against him because of the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest, and they murdered him on his bed. So he died, and they buried him in the City of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings. 
2CH.24.26	The conspirators against Joash were Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess. 
2CH.24.27	Now as to his sons and the many prophecies uttered against him and the rebuilding of the house of God, they are written in the commentary on the Book of Kings. Then his son Amaziah became king in his place.
2CH.25.1	Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. 
2CH.25.2	He did right in the sight of the L
2CH.25.3	When his kingdom was firmly established, he killed his servants who had struck down his father the king. 
2CH.25.4	But he did not kill their children; for 
2CH.25.5	Amaziah assembled [the men of] Judah and appointed them in accordance with 
2CH.25.6	He also hired 100,000 brave warriors from Israel for a hundred talents of silver. 
2CH.25.7	But a man of God came to him, saying, “O king, do not let this army of Israel go with you, for the L
2CH.25.8	But if you do go [in spite of this warning], be strong 
2CH.25.9	Amaziah said to the man of God, “But what 
2CH.25.10	So Amaziah dismissed the troops that came to him from Ephraim, to go home. So their anger was kindled 
2CH.25.11	Now Amaziah took courage and led his people out to the Valley of Salt, and he struck down 10,000 of the men of Seir (Edom). 
2CH.25.12	The sons of Judah also captured 10,000 alive and brought them to the top of the cliff. They threw them down from the top of the cliff and they were all crushed to pieces. 
2CH.25.13	But the troops whom Amaziah sent back, 
2CH.25.14	After Amaziah came back from the slaughter of the Edomites, he brought the gods of the sons of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, bowed before them, and burned incense to them. 
2CH.25.15	So the anger of the L
2CH.25.16	As he was talking, the king said to him, “Have we made you the king’s counselor? Stop! Why should you be put to death?” Then the prophet stopped and said, “I know that God has decided to destroy you because you have done this and have ignored my advice.”
2CH.25.17	Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent 
2CH.25.18	Then Joash king of Israel sent 
2CH.25.19	You say, ‘See, I have struck down 
2CH.25.20	But Amaziah would not listen, for it was from God, so that He might hand Judah over 
2CH.25.21	So Joash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another at Beth-shemesh, which belonged to Judah. 
2CH.25.22	And Judah was defeated by Israel, and they fled, every man to his tent. 
2CH.25.23	Then Joash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz (Ahaziah), at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate, 400 
2CH.25.24	 all the gold and silver and all the utensils which were found in the house of God with [the doorkeeper] Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king’s house (palace), and the hostages, and returned to Samaria.
2CH.25.25	And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived fifteen years after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz king of Israel. 
2CH.25.26	Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, from the first to the last, are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel? 
2CH.25.27	Now from the time that Amaziah turned away from following the L
2CH.25.28	Then they brought him on horses and buried him with his fathers in the City of [David in] Judah.
2CH.26.1	Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah. 
2CH.26.2	He built Eloth and restored it to Judah after the king [Amaziah] slept with his fathers [in death]. 
2CH.26.3	Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jechiliah of Jerusalem. 
2CH.26.4	He did right in the sight of the L
2CH.26.5	He continued to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding 
2CH.26.6	He went out and made war against the Philistines, and broke through the wall of Gath, the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities near Ashdod and [elsewhere] among the Philistines. 
2CH.26.7	God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabs who lived in Gur-baal, and the Meunites. 
2CH.26.8	The Ammonites paid tribute (money) to Uzziah, and his fame spread abroad, even as far as the border of Egypt, for he became very strong. 
2CH.26.9	Uzziah also built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, the Valley Gate, and at the corner buttress [of the wall], and fortified them. 
2CH.26.10	He also built towers in the wilderness and dug many cisterns, for he had a great deal of livestock, both in the lowlands and in the plain. 
2CH.26.11	Moreover, Uzziah had an army ready for battle, which went into combat by divisions according to the number of their muster as recorded by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the official, under the direction of Hananiah, one of the king’s commanders. 
2CH.26.12	The total number of the heads of the fathers’ households, of valiant men, was 2,600. 
2CH.26.13	Under their command was an army of 307,500, who could wage war with great power, to help the king against the enemy. 
2CH.26.14	Moreover, Uzziah prepared shields, spears, helmets, body armor, bows, and sling stones for the entire army. 
2CH.26.15	In Jerusalem he made machines of war invented by skillful men to be put on the towers and on the [corner] battlements for the purpose of shooting arrows and large stones. And his fame spread far, for he was marvelously helped until he was strong.
2CH.26.16	But when Uzziah became strong, he became so proud [of himself and his accomplishments] that he acted corruptly, and he was unfaithful 
2CH.26.17	Then Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him eighty priests of the L
2CH.26.18	They opposed King Uzziah and said to him, “It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the L
2CH.26.19	Then Uzziah, with a censer in his hand to burn incense, was enraged; and while he was enraged with the priests, 
2CH.26.20	As Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked toward him, behold, he was leprous on his forehead; and they hurried him out of there, and he also hurried to get out because the L
2CH.26.21	King Uzziah was a leper to the day of his death; and, being a leper, he lived in a separate house, for he was excluded from the house of the L
2CH.26.22	Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from the first to the last, Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, has written. 
2CH.26.23	So Uzziah slept with his fathers [in death], and they buried him with his fathers in the burial field of the kings [outside the royal tombs], for they said, “He is a leper.” And his son Jotham became king in his place.
2CH.27.1	Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok. 
2CH.27.2	He did right in the sight of the L
2CH.27.3	He built the upper gate of the house of the L
2CH.27.4	Moreover, he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and in the forests he built fortresses and towers. 
2CH.27.5	He also fought with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed over them. As a result the Ammonites gave him during that year a hundred talents of silver and ten thousand measures each of wheat and of barley. The Ammonites also paid him that much in the second year and third year. 
2CH.27.6	So Jotham grew powerful, because he directed his ways before the L
2CH.27.7	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. 
2CH.27.8	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.27.9	And Jotham slept with his fathers [in death], and they buried him in the City of David. Ahaz his son became king in his place.
2CH.28.1	Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do right in the sight of the L
2CH.28.2	Instead he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and even made cast images for the Baals. 
2CH.28.3	And he burned incense in the Valley of Ben-hinnom and burned his sons [as an offering], in accordance with the repulsive acts of the [pagan] nations whom the L
2CH.28.4	He also sacrificed and burned incense on the high places [of pagan worship], on the hills and under every green tree.
2CH.28.5	Therefore the L
2CH.28.6	For Pekah son of Remaliah killed 120,000 in Judah in one day, all courageous men, because they had abandoned (turned away from) the L
2CH.28.7	And Zichri, a warrior of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king’s son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah, who was second [in power] to the king.
2CH.28.8	And the sons of Israel led away captive 200,000 of their kinsmen [of Judah]—women, sons, and daughters—and they also took a great quantity of spoil from them and brought it to Samaria. 
2CH.28.9	But a prophet of the L
2CH.28.10	And now you intend to subjugate the people of Judah and Jerusalem as male and female slaves for yourselves. But are you yourselves not guilty 
2CH.28.11	Now therefore, hear me and return the captives whom you have captured from your brothers (fellow descendants of Israel, i.e. Jacob), for the burning anger of the L
2CH.28.12	Then some of the heads of the Ephraimites (Israel)—Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai—took a stand against those who were returning from the battle, 
2CH.28.13	and said to them, “You must not bring the captives in here; for we are guilty before the L
2CH.28.14	So the armed men [of Israel] left the captives and the spoil [of Judah] before the officers and all the assembly. 
2CH.28.15	Then the men who were designated by name rose up and took the captives, and from the spoil they clothed all those who were naked; they clothed them and gave them sandals, and fed them and gave them [something to] drink, anointed them [with oil, as was a host’s duty], and led all the feeble ones on donkeys, and they brought them to Jericho, the City of Palm Trees, to their brothers (fellow descendants of Israel, i.e. Jacob). Then they returned to Samaria.
2CH.28.16	At that time King Ahaz sent 
2CH.28.17	For the Edomites had come again and attacked Judah and led away captives. 
2CH.28.18	The Philistines had also invaded the cities of the low country and of the Negev (the South country) of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, and Soco with their villages, and also Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages, and they settled there. 
2CH.28.19	For the L
2CH.28.20	So Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came against him and harassed him instead of strengthening 
2CH.28.21	Although Ahaz took a portion [of treasure] from the house of the L
2CH.28.22	In the time of his distress, this same King Ahaz became yet more unfaithful to the L
2CH.28.23	For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which had defeated him, and he said, “Since the gods of the kings of Aram (Syria) helped them, I will sacrifice to them so that they may help me.” But they became the ruin 
2CH.28.24	Then Ahaz collected the utensils of the house of God and he cut them in pieces; and he shut the doors of the house of the L
2CH.28.25	In every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, provoking to anger the L
2CH.28.26	Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, from the first to the last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.28.27	And Ahaz slept with his fathers [in death], and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem, but they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. And his son Hezekiah reigned in his place.
2CH.29.1	Hezekiah became king when he was twenty-five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abijah the daughter of Zechariah. 
2CH.29.2	He did right in the sight of the L
2CH.29.3	In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the L
2CH.29.4	He brought in the priests and Levites and gathered them into the square on the east.
2CH.29.5	Then he said to them, “Levites, listen to me! Now consecrate (dedicate) yourselves and consecrate the house of the L
2CH.29.6	For our fathers have been unfaithful and have done evil in the sight of the L
2CH.29.7	They have also closed the doors of the [temple] porch and put out the lamps, and they have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the Holy Place to the God of Israel. 
2CH.29.8	Therefore the wrath of the L
2CH.29.9	For behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity because of this. 
2CH.29.10	Now it is in my heart to make a covenant (solemn agreement) with the L
2CH.29.11	My sons, do not be negligent 
2CH.29.12	Then the Levites arose: Mahath the son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah, from the sons of the Kohathites; from the sons of Merari: Kish the son of Abdi, Azariah the son of Jehallelel; from the Gershonites: Joah the son of Zimmah and Eden the son of Joah; 
2CH.29.13	from the sons of Elizaphan: Shimri and Jeiel; from the sons of Asaph: Zechariah, and Mattaniah; 
2CH.29.14	from the sons of Heman: Jehiel and Shimei; and from the sons of Jeduthun: Shemaiah and Uzziel. 
2CH.29.15	They gathered their brothers (fellow Levites) together, consecrated themselves, and went in to cleanse the house of the L
2CH.29.16	The priests went into the inner part of the house of the L
2CH.29.17	Now they began the consecration on the first [day] of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the porch of the L
2CH.29.18	Then they went inside to King Hezekiah and said, “We have cleansed the entire house (temple) of the L
2CH.29.19	Moreover, we have prepared and consecrated all the utensils which King Ahaz had discarded during his reign in his unfaithfulness; and behold, they are in front of the altar of the L
2CH.29.20	Then King Hezekiah arose early and assembled the officials of the city, and went up to the house of the L
2CH.29.21	They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats for a sin offering for the kingdom, the sanctuary, and Judah. He commanded the priests, the sons of Aaron, to offer them on the altar of the L
2CH.29.22	So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. They also slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar; then they slaughtered the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar. 
2CH.29.23	Then they brought the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them [to symbolize the transference of their sin]. 
2CH.29.24	The priests slaughtered them and cleansed the altar from sin with their blood to atone for all Israel, because the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering 
2CH.29.25	Hezekiah stationed the Levites in the house of the L
2CH.29.26	The Levites stood with the 
2CH.29.27	Then Hezekiah gave the order to offer the burnt offering on the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song to the L
2CH.29.28	The entire congregation worshiped, the singers also sang, and the trumpets sounded; all this 
2CH.29.29	When the burnt offerings were completed, the king and all who were present with him bowed down and worshiped [God]. 
2CH.29.30	Also King Hezekiah and the officials ordered the Levites to exclaim praises to the L
2CH.29.31	Then Hezekiah said, “Now you have consecrated yourselves to the L
2CH.29.32	The number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was 70 bulls, 100 rams, and 200 lambs. All these were for a burnt offering to the L
2CH.29.33	The consecrated things were 600 bulls and 3,000 sheep. 
2CH.29.34	But there were too few priests and they were unable to skin all the burnt offerings; so until the 
2CH.29.35	There were also many burnt offerings with the fat of the peace offerings and with the drink offerings for the burnt offerings. So the service of the house of the L
2CH.29.36	Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced because of what God had prepared for the people, for the thing came about suddenly.
2CH.30.1	Hezekiah sent 
2CH.30.2	For the king and his officials and all the assembly in Jerusalem had decided to celebrate the Passover in the 
2CH.30.3	since they could not celebrate it at that time because a sufficient number of priests had not consecrated themselves, nor had the people assembled at Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.4	Thus the [decision to set a] new time pleased the king and the entire assembly. 
2CH.30.5	So they decided to circulate a proclamation throughout Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, that the people were to come to celebrate the Passover to the L
2CH.30.6	So the runners went throughout Israel and Judah with the letters from the hand of the king and his officials, in accordance with the command of the king, saying, “O sons (descendants) of Israel, return to the L
2CH.30.7	Do not be like your fathers and your brothers, who were unfaithful to the L
2CH.30.8	Now do not stiffen your neck [becoming obstinate] like your fathers, but yield to the L
2CH.30.9	For if you return to the L
2CH.30.10	So the runners (couriers) passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, as far as Zebulun; but the people laughed at them with scorn and mocked them. 
2CH.30.11	Yet 
2CH.30.12	Also the hand of God was on Judah to give them one heart to do that which the king and the officials had commanded by the word of the L
2CH.30.13	Now many people were gathered at Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month; it was a very large assembly. 
2CH.30.14	They took action and removed the [pagan] altars which were in Jerusalem; they also removed all the incense altars and threw them into the Brook Kidron [the dumping place for the ashes of such repulsive things]. 
2CH.30.15	Then they slaughtered the Passover 
2CH.30.16	They stood at their accustomed stations, in accordance with the Law of Moses, the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood [which they received] from the hand of the Levites [on the altar]. 
2CH.30.17	For there were many in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves [that is, become ceremonially clean and free from all sin]; so the Levites had to slaughter the Passover 
2CH.30.18	For the majority of the people, many from Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not purified themselves, and yet they ate the Passover contrary to what had been prescribed. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, “May the good L
2CH.30.19	everyone who sets his heart to seek God—the L
2CH.30.20	So the L
2CH.30.21	The Israelites who were present in Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy. The Levites and priests praised the L
2CH.30.22	Hezekiah spoke 
2CH.30.23	Then the whole assembly decided to celebrate [the feast] for another seven days; and they celebrated it 
2CH.30.24	For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep, and the officials gave the assembly 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep. And a large number of priests consecrated themselves [for service]. 
2CH.30.25	All the assembly of Judah rejoiced, with the priests and the Levites and all the assembly that came from Israel, both the sojourners (resident aliens, foreigners) who came from the land of Israel and those living in Judah. 
2CH.30.26	So there was great joy in Jerusalem, because there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem since the time of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel. 
2CH.30.27	Then the priests and Levites stood and blessed the people; and their voice was heard and their prayer came up to His holy dwelling place, to heaven.
2CH.31.1	Now when all of this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah, and smashed the [pagan] pillars (obelisks, memorial stones) in pieces, cut down the Asherim (wooden symbols of a female deity), and tore down the high places and the altars [of idolatry] throughout all Judah and Benjamin, as well as in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the sons (descendants) of Israel returned to their own cities, each to his own property.
2CH.31.2	And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests, and the Levites by their divisions, each in accordance with his service, both the priests and Levites, for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister and to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the camp of the L
2CH.31.3	Hezekiah also 
2CH.31.4	He also told (ordered) the people living in Jerusalem to give the portion that was due to the priests and Levites, so that they might [be free to] devote themselves to the Law of the L
2CH.31.5	As soon as the 
2CH.31.6	The sons of Israel and Judah who lived in the cities of Judah also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of sacred gifts which were consecrated to the L
2CH.31.7	In the third month [at the end of wheat harvest] they began to make the heaps, and they finished them in the seventh month. 
2CH.31.8	When Hezekiah and the rulers came and saw the heaps, they blessed the L
2CH.31.9	Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and Levites about the heaps. 
2CH.31.10	Azariah the high priest of the house of Zadok answered him, “Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the L
2CH.31.11	Then Hezekiah told them to prepare rooms [for storage] in the house of the L
2CH.31.12	They faithfully brought in the contributions, the tithes, and the sacred (dedicated) things. Conaniah the Levite was in charge of them, and Shimei his brother was second [in authority]. 
2CH.31.13	Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers directed by Conaniah and Shimei his brother by the appointment of King Hezekiah, and Azariah was the 
2CH.31.14	Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, keeper of the East Gate, was in charge of the voluntary offerings to God, to apportion the contributions for the L
2CH.31.15	Under his authority were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah in the cities of the priests, to distribute faithfully 
2CH.31.16	without regard to their genealogical registration, to the males from thirty years old and upward—everyone who entered the house of the L
2CH.31.17	as well as the priests who were registered genealogically according to their fathers’ households, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, by their duties and by their divisions. 
2CH.31.18	The genealogical registration 
2CH.31.19	Also for the sons of Aaron, the priests, who were in the pasture lands of their cities or in each and every city, there were men who were designated by name to give portions to every male among the priests and to everyone genealogically registered among the Levites.
2CH.31.20	This is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah; and he did what was good, right, and true before the L
2CH.31.21	Every work which he began in the service of the house of God in keeping with the law and the commandment, seeking 
2CH.32.1	After these things and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah and besieged the fortified cities, intending to take them for himself. 
2CH.32.2	When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that he intended to go to war against Jerusalem, 
2CH.32.3	he decided, together with his officers and his soldiers, to stop up the water [supply] from the springs which were outside the city [by enclosing them with masonry and concealing them], and they helped him. 
2CH.32.4	So many people came together, and they stopped up all the springs and the brook which flowed [underground] through the region, saying, “Why should the kings of Assyria come and find an abundance of water?” 
2CH.32.5	Also Hezekiah resolutely set to work and rebuilt all the wall that had been broken down, and erected towers on it, and 
2CH.32.6	He also appointed military officers over the people and gathered them to him in the square at the city gate, and spoke 
2CH.32.7	“Be strong and courageous. Do not fear or be dismayed because of the king of Assyria, nor because of all the army that is with him; for the One with us is greater than the one with him. 
2CH.32.8	With him there is only an arm of flesh, but with us is the L
2CH.32.9	After this, Sennacherib king of Assyria, while he was at Lachish [besieging it] with all his forces, sent his servants to Jerusalem, to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah who were at Jerusalem, saying, 
2CH.32.10	“Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria, ‘In what do you trust that you are remaining in Jerusalem under siege? 
2CH.32.11	Is not Hezekiah misleading you in order to let you die by famine and thirst, 
2CH.32.12	Has the same Hezekiah not taken away 
2CH.32.13	Do you not know what I and my fathers (ancestors) have done to all the peoples of the [other] lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands able to rescue their lands from my hand at all? 
2CH.32.14	Who [was there] among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed who was able to rescue his people from my hand, that your God should be able to rescue you from my hand? 
2CH.32.15	So now, do not let Hezekiah deceive or mislead you like this, and do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to rescue his people from my hand or the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God rescue you from my hand!’ ”
2CH.32.16	And his servants said 
2CH.32.17	The Assyrian king also wrote letters insulting 
2CH.32.18	They shouted it loudly in the language of Judah to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten and terrify them, so that they might take the city [without a long siege]. 
2CH.32.19	They spoke of the God of Jerusalem as [they spoke of] the gods of the peoples of the earth, [which are only] the work of the hands of men.
2CH.32.20	But Hezekiah the king and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz prayed about this and cried out to heaven [for help]. 
2CH.32.21	And the L
2CH.32.22	Thus the L
2CH.32.23	And many brought gifts to the L
2CH.32.24	In those days Hezekiah became terminally ill; and he prayed to the L
2CH.32.25	But Hezekiah did nothing [for the L
2CH.32.26	However, Hezekiah humbled his proud heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the L
2CH.32.27	Now Hezekiah had immense wealth and honor; and he made for himself treasuries for silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and all kinds of delightful articles, 
2CH.32.28	and storehouses for the produce of grain, new wine, and [olive] oil, and stalls for all kinds of cattle, and sheepfolds for the flocks. 
2CH.32.29	Moreover, he made cities for himself and 
2CH.32.30	This same Hezekiah also stopped up the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon and channeled them down to the west side of the City of David. Hezekiah succeeded in everything that he did. 
2CH.32.31	And so 
2CH.32.32	Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his godly achievements, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.32.33	So Hezekiah slept with his fathers [in death] and they buried him in the upper section of the tombs of the descendants of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death. And his son Manasseh became king in his place.
2CH.33.1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned for fifty-five years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.33.2	But he did evil in the sight of the L
2CH.33.3	For he rebuilt the [idolatrous] high places which his father Hezekiah had torn down; and he set up altars for the Baals and made the 
2CH.33.4	He built [pagan] altars in the house of the L
2CH.33.5	He built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the L
2CH.33.6	He made his sons pass through the fire [as an offering to his gods] in the Valley of Ben-hinnom; and he practiced witchcraft, used divination, and practiced sorcery, and dealt with mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the sight of the L
2CH.33.7	Then he set the carved image of the idol which he had made in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, I will put My Name [and the symbol of my Presence] forever; 
2CH.33.8	and I will not again remove Israel from the land which I appointed for your fathers, if they will only be careful to do everything that I have commanded them in regard to all the law, the statutes, and the ordinances 
2CH.33.9	So Manasseh caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to sin, by doing more evil than the [pagan] nations whom the L
2CH.33.10	Now the L
2CH.33.11	So the L
2CH.33.12	But when he was in distress, he sought the L
2CH.33.13	When he prayed to Him, He was moved by his entreaty and heard his pleading, and brought him back to Jerusalem to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the L
2CH.33.14	After this he built an outer wall for the City of David on the west side of Gihon, in the river valley, to the entrance of the Fish Gate; and he encircled the 
2CH.33.15	He also removed the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the L
2CH.33.16	Then he set up the altar of the L
2CH.33.17	Yet the people still sacrificed on the high places, 
2CH.33.18	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the L
2CH.33.19	His prayer also and how God heard him, and all his sin, his unfaithfulness, and the sites on which he built high places and set up the Asherim and the carved images, before he humbled himself, behold, they are written in the records of the 
2CH.33.20	So Manasseh slept with his fathers [in death], and they buried him in [the garden of] his own house. And his son Amon became king in his place.
2CH.33.21	Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned for two years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.33.22	But he did evil in the sight of the L
2CH.33.23	Further, he did not humble himself before the L
2CH.33.24	And his servants conspired against him and killed him in his own house (palace). 
2CH.33.25	But the people of the land struck down all those who had conspired against King Amon, and they made his son Josiah king in his place.
2CH.34.1	Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned for thirty-one years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.2	He did what was right in the sight of the L
2CH.34.3	For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young (sixteen), he began to seek after 
2CH.34.4	They tore down the altars of the Baals in his presence; he cut to pieces the incense altars that were high above them; he also smashed the Asherim and the carved images and the cast images to pieces, and ground them to dust and scattered it on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them. 
2CH.34.5	Then Josiah burned the bones of the [pagan] priests on their altars and purged 
2CH.34.6	In the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, Simeon, and as far as Naphtali, in their surrounding ruins, 
2CH.34.7	he tore down the altars and beat 
2CH.34.8	In the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign, when he had purged the land and the [L
2CH.34.9	When they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that had been brought into the house of God, which the Levites, who guarded the doors, had collected from Manasseh and Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, and from all Judah and Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.10	Then they gave it to the workmen who were appointed over the house of the L
2CH.34.11	They in turn gave it to the carpenters and builders to buy quarried stone and timber for couplings (trusses, braces) and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had let go to ruin. 
2CH.34.12	The men did the work faithfully with foremen over them to supervise 
2CH.34.13	 also in charge of the burden bearers [who carried heavy loads], and supervised all the workmen in any kind of service; and some of the Levites were scribes and officials and gatekeepers.
2CH.34.14	When they were bringing out the money which had been brought into the house of the L
2CH.34.15	Hilkiah told Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the L
2CH.34.16	Shaphan brought the book to the king, but [first] reported further to him, “Your servants are doing everything that was entrusted to them. 
2CH.34.17	They have emptied out the money that was found in the house of the L
2CH.34.18	Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king.
2CH.34.19	When the king heard the words of the Law, he tore his clothes. 
2CH.34.20	Then the king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying, 
2CH.34.21	“Go, inquire of the L
2CH.34.22	So Hilkiah and those whom the king had told went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem, in the Second Quarter); and they spoke to her about this. 
2CH.34.23	And she answered them, “Thus says the L
2CH.34.24	thus says the L
2CH.34.25	Because they have abandoned (rejected) Me and have burned incense to other gods, in order to provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands, 
2CH.34.26	But you shall say the following to King Josiah of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the L
2CH.34.27	“Because your heart was gentle 
2CH.34.28	“Behold, I will gather you to your fathers [in death], and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not see all the evil which I am going to bring on this place and on its inhabitants.” ’ ” So they brought back word to the king.
2CH.34.29	Then the king sent 
2CH.34.30	And the king went up to the house of the L
2CH.34.31	Then the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the L
2CH.34.32	Further, he made all who were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin stand [with him, in confirmation of it]. So the inhabitants of Jerusalem acted in accordance with the covenant of God, the God of their fathers. 
2CH.34.33	Josiah removed all the [pagan] repulsive things from all the lands belonging to the sons (descendants) of Israel, and made all who were present in Israel serve the L
2CH.35.1	Josiah celebrated the Passover to the L
2CH.35.2	He appointed the priests to their positions and encouraged them in the service of the house of the L
2CH.35.3	To the Levites who taught all Israel and were holy to the L
2CH.35.4	Prepare 
2CH.35.5	And stand in the holy place [of the priests] according to the sections of the fathers’ households of your fellow kinsmen the lay people, and according to the Levites, by division of [the families of] a father’s household. 
2CH.35.6	Slaughter the Passover 
2CH.35.7	Then Josiah contributed to the lay people, to all who were present, flocks of lambs and young goats numbering 30,000, all as Passover offerings, and 3,000 bulls—these were from the king’s property. 
2CH.35.8	His officers also contributed a voluntary offering to the people, the priests and the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the officials of the house of God, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings 2,600 
2CH.35.9	Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, officers of the Levites, contributed to the Levites for the Passover offerings 5,000 
2CH.35.10	When the service was ready, the priests stood in their [assigned] places and the Levites by their divisions, in accordance with the king’s command. 
2CH.35.11	They slaughtered the Passover 
2CH.35.12	Then they removed the burnt offerings, to distribute them to the sections of the fathers’ households of the lay people to offer to the L
2CH.35.13	So they roasted the Passover 
2CH.35.14	Afterward the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the sons of Aaron, 
2CH.35.15	The singers, the sons of Asaph, were also in their places in accordance with the command of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer; and the gatekeepers at each gate did not need to leave their service, because their kinsmen the Levites prepared for them.
2CH.35.16	So all the service of the L
2CH.35.17	Thus the sons of Israel who were present celebrated the Passover at that time, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days. 
2CH.35.18	No Passover like it had been celebrated in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet; nor had any of the kings of Israel celebrated such a Passover as Josiah did with the priests, the Levites, all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
2CH.35.19	In the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign this Passover was celebrated.
2CH.35.20	After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt came up to make war at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah went out to meet him. 
2CH.35.21	But Neco sent messengers to Josiah, saying, “What business do we have with each other, O King of Judah? 
2CH.35.22	Yet Josiah would not turn away from him, but disguised himself in order to fight against him. He did not listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, but came to fight against him on the plain of Megiddo. 
2CH.35.23	The archers shot King Josiah, and the king said to his servants, “Take me away, for I am badly wounded.” 
2CH.35.24	So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried him in the second chariot which he had, and brought him to Jerusalem where he died and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. 
2CH.35.25	Then Jeremiah sung a lament (funeral song) for Josiah, and all the male and female singers have spoken about Josiah in their laments to this day. They made the songs an ordinance in Israel; behold, they are written in the Lamentations. 
2CH.35.26	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his deeds of devotion 
2CH.35.27	and his acts, from the first to the last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
2CH.36.1	Then the people of the land took Joahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in Jerusalem in place of his father. 
2CH.36.2	Joahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned [only] three months in Jerusalem. 
2CH.36.3	Then the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and imposed a fine on the land of a hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold. 
2CH.36.4	The king of Egypt made Eliakim, the brother 
2CH.36.5	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem; and he did evil in the sight of the L
2CH.36.6	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against him and bound him with bronze [chains] to take him to Babylon. 
2CH.36.7	Nebuchadnezzar also brought some of the articles of the house (temple) of the L
2CH.36.8	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim and the repulsive acts which he committed, and what was found against him, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. And his son Jehoiachin became king in his place.
2CH.36.9	Jehoiachin was eight[teen] years old when he became king, and he reigned for three months and ten days in Jerusalem, and he did evil in the sight of the L
2CH.36.10	Now at the turn of the year [in the spring], King Nebuchadnezzar sent 
2CH.36.11	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.36.12	He did evil in the sight of the L
2CH.36.13	He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar who had made him swear 
2CH.36.14	Also, all the officials of the priests and the people were very unfaithful, 
2CH.36.15	The L
2CH.36.16	But they kept mocking the messengers of God and despising His words and scoffing at His prophets until the wrath of the L
2CH.36.17	Therefore He brought the king of the Chaldeans against them, who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or virgin, old man or infirm; He gave them all into his hand. 
2CH.36.18	And as for all the articles of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the L
2CH.36.19	Then they burned the house of God and tore down the wall of Jerusalem, and burned all its fortified buildings with fire, and destroyed all its valuable articles. 
2CH.36.20	He deported to Babylon those who had escaped from the sword; and they were servants to him and to his sons until the kingdom of Persia was established there, 
2CH.36.21	to fulfill the word of the L
2CH.36.22	Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia—in order to fulfill the word of the L
2CH.36.23	“Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: ‘The L
EZR.1.1	Now in the 
EZR.1.2	“Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, ‘The

EZR.1.4	In any place where a survivor (Jewish exile) may live, let the men (Gentiles) of that place support him with silver and gold, with goods and cattle, together with freewill offerings for the house of God in Jerusalem.’ ”
EZR.1.5	Then the heads of the fathers’ 
EZR.1.6	All those who were around them encouraged them with articles of silver, with gold, with goods, with cattle, and with valuable things, in addition to all that was given as a freewill offering. 
EZR.1.7	Also King Cyrus brought out the articles of the house of the L
EZR.1.8	And Cyrus, king of Persia, had Mithredath the treasurer bring them out, and he counted them out to 
EZR.1.9	And they counted: 30 dishes (basins) of gold, 1,000 dishes of silver, 29 duplicates; 
EZR.1.10	30 [small] gold bowls, 410 [small] silver bowls of a second

EZR.2.58	All the temple servants and the sons of Solomon’s servants totaled 392.
EZR.2.59	Now these are the ones who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer, but they could not provide evidence of their fathers’ households and their descendants, whether they were of Israel: 
EZR.2.60	the sons of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda, 652.
EZR.2.61	Of the sons of the priests: the sons of Hobaiah, of Hakkoz, and of Barzillai, who took a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and he was known by their name. 
EZR.2.62	These searched [for their names] among those registered in the genealogies, but they were not found; so they 
EZR.2.63	The 
EZR.2.64	The whole assembly totaled 42,360, 
EZR.2.65	besides their male and female servants who numbered 7,337; and [among them] they had 200 male and female singers. 
EZR.2.66	Their horses totaled 736; their mules, 245; 
EZR.2.67	their camels totaled 435; their donkeys, 6,720.
EZR.2.68	Some of the 
EZR.2.69	They gave according to their ability to the treasury for the work, 61,000 drachmas of gold, 5,000 minas of silver, and 100 priestly [linen] garments.
EZR.2.70	So the priests, the Levites, some of the people, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants settled in their [own] cities, and all Israel [gradually settled] into their cities.
EZR.3.1	When the seventh month came and the sons of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered together as one man to Jerusalem. 
EZR.3.2	Then Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brothers arose, and they built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the 
EZR.3.3	So they set up the altar on its [old] foundation, 
EZR.3.4	They celebrated the Feast of 
EZR.3.5	and afterward, there was the continual burnt offering, the offering at the New Moons, and at all the appointed festivals of the L
EZR.3.6	From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the L
EZR.3.7	They gave money to the masons and to the carpenters, and gave food, drink, and [olive] oil to the people from Sidon and Tyre, to bring cedar wood from Lebanon to the seaport of Joppa, in accordance with the authorization they had from Cyrus king of Persia.
EZR.3.8	In the second year of their coming to God’s house at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak began [the work], with the rest of their brothers—the priests and Levites and all who came to Jerusalem from the captivity. They appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to oversee the work of the house of the L
EZR.3.9	Then Jeshua with his sons and brothers stood united with Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah and the sons of Henadad with their sons and brothers the Levites, to oversee the workmen in the house of God.
EZR.3.10	Now when the builders had laid the foundation of the temple of the L
EZR.3.11	They sang [responsively], praising and giving thanks to the L
EZR.3.12	But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers’ 
EZR.3.13	so that the people could not distinguish the sound of the shout of joy from the sound of the weeping of the people, for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the sound was heard far away.
EZR.4.1	Now when [the Samaritans] the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles from the captivity were building a temple to the L
EZR.4.2	they came to Zerubbabel [who was now governor] and to the heads of the fathers’ 
EZR.4.3	But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of fathers’ 
EZR.4.4	Then [the Samaritans and others of] the people of the land 
EZR.4.5	and hired advisers [to work] against them to frustrate their plans during the entire time that Cyrus king of Persia reigned, [and this lasted] even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
EZR.4.6	Now in the reign of 
EZR.4.7	Later, in the days of [King] Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel and the rest of their associates wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the text of the letter was written in Aramaic and translated 
EZR.4.8	Rehum the [Persian] commander [of the Samaritans] and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king as follows— 
EZR.4.9	then 
EZR.4.10	and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble 
EZR.4.11	this is a copy of the letter which they sent to him:
EZR.4.11	“
EZR.4.12	Let it be known to the king that the Jews who came up from you have come to us at Jerusalem. They are rebuilding this rebellious and evil city and are finishing its walls and repairing the foundations. 
EZR.4.13	Now let it be known to the king, that if that city is rebuilt and the walls are finished, then they will not pay tax, custom, or toll, and the revenue of the kings will be diminished. 
EZR.4.14	Now because we are in the service of the palace, and it is not proper for us to witness the king’s dishonor, for that reason we have sent 
EZR.4.15	in order that a search may be made in the record books of your fathers. And you will discover in the record books and learn that this is a rebellious city, damaging to kings and provinces, and that in the past they have incited rebellion within it. That is why that city was laid waste (destroyed). 
EZR.4.16	We are informing the king that if that city is rebuilt and its walls finished, it will mean that you will have no possession in 
EZR.4.18	The document which you sent to us has been translated and read before me. 
EZR.4.19	I have issued a command and a search has been made, and it has been discovered that this city [Jerusalem] in earlier times has revolted against the kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been perpetrated in it. 
EZR.4.20	There have also been mighty kings over Jerusalem who have ruled over all 
EZR.4.21	So, now issue a decree to make these men stop [work], so that this city is not rebuilt until a [new] command is issued by me. 
EZR.4.22	Beware of being negligent in carrying out this 
EZR.4.23	Then as soon as the copy of King Artaxerxes’ document was read before Rehum and Shimshai the scribe, and their colleagues, they went up hurriedly to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them stop [work] by force of arms.
EZR.4.24	Then the 
EZR.5.1	Now when the prophets, Haggai the prophet and Zechariah, the son (grandson) of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, 
EZR.5.2	then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel [heir to the throne of Judah] and Jeshua the son of Jozadak arose and began to rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem; and the prophets of God [Haggai and Zechariah] were with them, supporting 
EZR.5.3	At that time Tattenai, the governor of 
EZR.5.4	Then, accordingly, we told them the names of the men who were reconstructing this building. 
EZR.5.5	But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, so they [Tattenai and the others] did not stop them until a report could come before Darius, and then an answer was returned by letter concerning it.
EZR.5.7	They sent a report to him in which it was written: “To Darius the king, all peace. 
EZR.5.8	Let it be known to the king that we have gone to the province of Judah, to the house of the great God. It is being built with huge stones, with beams laid in the walls; and this work goes on with diligence 
EZR.5.9	Then we asked those elders, ‘Who issued you a decree to rebuild this temple and to finish this structure?’ 
EZR.5.10	We also asked them their names so that we might notify you, and so that we might record the names of the men 
EZR.5.11	They replied, ‘We are servants of the God of heaven and earth, and are rebuilding the temple which was erected many years ago, which a 
EZR.5.12	But because our fathers provoked the God of heaven to wrath, He handed them over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this temple and exiled the people to Babylon. 
EZR.5.13	But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, [the same] King Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this house of God. 
EZR.5.14	Also the gold and silver utensils of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem and had brought into the temple of Babylon, King Cyrus took from the temple of Babylon and had them given to a man whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had appointed governor. 
EZR.5.15	And Cyrus said to him, “Take these utensils, go and deposit them in the temple in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its site.” 
EZR.5.16	Then that Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem; and from then until now it has been under construction and is not yet completed.’ 
EZR.5.17	So now, if it pleases the king, let a search be conducted in the king’s treasure house [in the royal archives] there in Babylon to see if it is true that a decree was issued by King Cyrus to rebuild this house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send us his decision concerning this matter.”
EZR.6.1	Then King Darius issued a decree, and a search was conducted in Babylon in the archives where the treasures [and records] were stored. 
EZR.6.2	In Ecbatana in the fortress (palace) in the province of Media, a scroll was found on which this was recorded: “Memorandum— 
EZR.6.3	In the first year of King Cyrus, Cyrus the king issued a decree: ‘
EZR.6.4	with three layers of huge stones and one layer of timbers. Let the cost be paid from the royal treasury. 
EZR.6.5	Also let the gold and silver utensils of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be returned and brought back to their [proper] places in the temple in Jerusalem; and you shall put them in the house of God.’
EZR.6.6	“Now 
EZR.6.7	Leave the work on this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the Jewish elders rebuild this house of God on its site. 
EZR.6.8	Also, I issue a decree as to what you are to do for these Jewish elders for the rebuilding of this house of God: the full cost is to be paid to these people from the royal treasury out of the taxes of 
EZR.6.9	Whatever is needed, including young bulls, rams, and lambs for the burnt offerings to the God of heaven, and wheat, salt, wine, and anointing oil, according to the request of the priests at Jerusalem, let it all be given to them daily without fail, 
EZR.6.10	so that they may offer pleasing (sweet-smelling) sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons. 
EZR.6.11	I have also issued a decree that 
EZR.6.12	May the God who has caused His 
EZR.6.13	Then Tattenai, governor of 
EZR.6.14	And the Jewish elders built and prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. They finished their building as commanded by the God of Israel and in accordance with the decree of Cyrus and Darius and Artaxerxes king of Persia. 
EZR.6.15	This temple was finished on the third day of the month of Adar, in the 
EZR.6.16	And all Israel—the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the [former] exiles—celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy. 
EZR.6.17	They offered at the dedication of this house of God 100 bulls, 200 rams, 400 lambs, and, as a sin offering for all Israel, 12 male goats, according to the number of Israel’s tribes. 
EZR.6.18	Then they appointed the priests to their divisions and the Levites in their orders for the service of God at Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses.
EZR.6.19	The [former] exiles kept the Passover on the fourteenth [day] of the first month. 
EZR.6.20	For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were [ceremonially] clean. So they slaughtered the Passover 
EZR.6.21	The 
EZR.6.22	They observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with joy, for the L
EZR.7.1	Now after this, in the reign of Artaxerxes I [son of Ahasuerus (Xerxes)] king of Persia, Ezra the son (descendant) of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, 
EZR.7.2	the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, 
EZR.7.3	the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth, 
EZR.7.4	the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, 
EZR.7.5	the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest— 
EZR.7.6	this Ezra went up from Babylon. He was a scribe skilled in the Law (the five books) of Moses, which the L
EZR.7.7	Some of the sons of Israel, with some of the priests and Levites, the singers and gatekeepers, and the temple servants also went up [from Babylon] to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes.
EZR.7.8	Ezra came to Jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king. 
EZR.7.9	For on the first of the first month he started out from Babylon, and on the first of the fifth month he arrived in Jerusalem, because the good hand of his God was on him. 
EZR.7.10	For Ezra had set his heart (resolved) to study 
EZR.7.11	Now this is a copy of the decree that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe [who was] learned in the words of the commandments of the L
EZR.7.12	“Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law of the God of heaven, perfect 
EZR.7.13	I have issued a decree that all of the people of Israel and their priests and the Levites in my kingdom who are willing to go to Jerusalem, may go with you. 
EZR.7.14	For you are sent by the king and his seven advisers to inquire about Judah and Jerusalem in accordance with the Law of your God, which is in your hand, 
EZR.7.15	and to bring [with you] the silver and gold which the king and his advisers have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem, 
EZR.7.16	and all the silver and gold which you find in the whole province of Babylon, along with the freewill offering of the people and of the priests for the house of their God in Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.17	Therefore with this money, you shall diligently buy bulls, rams, and lambs, with their grain offerings and drink offerings, and offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.18	And whatever seems good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, you may do in accordance with the will of your God. 
EZR.7.19	As for the utensils which are given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver [those] in full before the God of Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.20	The rest of the things required for the house of your God, which you may have occasion to provide, provide it from the royal treasury.
EZR.7.21	“And I, Artaxerxes the king, issue a decree to all the treasurers 
EZR.7.22	 up to 100 talents of silver, 100 kors (measures) of wheat, 100 baths of wine, 100 baths of [olive] oil, and salt as needed. 
EZR.7.23	Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done diligently 
EZR.7.24	We also inform you that it is not authorized to impose tax, tribute, or toll on any of the priests, Levites, singers, doorkeepers, temple servants or

EZR.7.26	Whoever does not observe 
EZR.7.27	Blessed be the L
EZR.7.28	and has extended His mercy 
EZR.8.1	These are the heads of their fathers’ 
EZR.8.2	of the 
EZR.8.3	of the sons of Shecaniah 
EZR.8.4	of the sons of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah, with 200 men; 
EZR.8.5	of the sons of Zattu, Shecaniah son of Jahaziel, with 300 men; 
EZR.8.6	of the sons of Adin, Ebed son of Jonathan, with 50 men; 
EZR.8.7	of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah son of Athaliah, with 70 men; 
EZR.8.8	of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah son of Michael, with 80 men; 
EZR.8.9	of the sons of Joab, Obadiah son of Jehiel, with 218 men; 
EZR.8.10	of the sons of Bani, Shelomith son of Josiphiah, with 160 men; 
EZR.8.11	of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah son of Bebai, with 28 men; 
EZR.8.12	of the sons of Azgad, Johanan son of Hakkatan, with 110 men; 
EZR.8.13	of the sons of Adonikam, the last to come, their names are Eliphelet, 
EZR.8.14	and of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and 
EZR.8.15	Now I gathered them together at the river that runs to Ahava, where we camped for three days. I observed the people and the priests, and I did not find any Levites there. 
EZR.8.16	So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, [who were] leading men, and also for Joiarib and Elnathan, [who were] teachers. 
EZR.8.17	And I sent them to Iddo, the leading man at the place Casiphia, telling them what to say to Iddo and his brothers, the temple servants at the place Casiphia, 
EZR.8.18	And as the good hand of our God was upon us, they brought us a man of understanding (insight) from the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel, 
EZR.8.19	and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, with his brothers (relatives) and their sons, 20 men; 
EZR.8.20	also 220 of the temple servants, whom David and the leaders had set apart [with their descendants] for the service of the Levites. They were all designated by name.
EZR.8.21	Then I proclaimed a fast there at the river Ahava, so that we might humble ourselves before our God to seek from Him a safe journey for us, our 
EZR.8.22	For I was ashamed to request troops and horsemen from the king to protect us from the enemy along the way, because we had told the king, “The hand of our God is favorable toward all those who seek Him, but His power and His anger are against all those who abandon (turn away from) Him.” 
EZR.8.23	So we fasted and sought [help from] our God concerning this [matter], and He heard our plea.
EZR.8.24	Then I set apart twelve leading priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers (relatives), 
EZR.8.25	and I weighed out to them the silver, the gold, and the utensils, the offering for the house of our God which the king, his advisers, his officials, and all Israel who were present there had offered. 
EZR.8.26	I weighed into their hands 650 talents of silver, and silver utensils 
EZR.8.27	also 20 bowls of gold 
EZR.8.28	Then I said to them, “You are holy to the L
EZR.8.29	Guard and keep them until you weigh them before the leading priests and the Levites and the leaders of the fathers’ 
EZR.8.30	So the priests and the Levites received the weighed out silver and gold, and the utensils, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.
EZR.8.31	We set out from the river Ahava on the twelfth [day] of the first month to go to Jerusalem; and the hand of our God was upon us, and He rescued us from the hand of the enemy and those who lay in ambushes along the way. 
EZR.8.32	So we came to Jerusalem and remained there for three days.
EZR.8.33	On the fourth day the silver and the gold and the utensils were weighed out in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest, and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them were the Levites—Jozabad the son of Jeshua and Noadiah the son of Binnui. 
EZR.8.34	Every piece was counted and weighed, and all the weight was recorded at that time.
EZR.8.35	Also the [former] exiles who had come from the captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, 77 lambs, and 12 male goats for a sin offering. All this was a burnt offering to the L
EZR.8.36	And they delivered the king’s edicts to the king’s satraps (lieutenants) and to the governors 
EZR.9.1	When these things were completed, the officials came to me and said, “The people of Israel and the priests and Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, but have committed the repulsive acts of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites. 
EZR.9.2	For they have taken some of their daughters 
EZR.9.3	When I heard this, I tore my clothing and my robe [in grief], I pulled out some of the hair from my head and my beard, and sat down appalled [at the shame of it]. 
EZR.9.4	Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel because of the unfaithfulness of the exiles gathered to me as I sat appalled until the evening offering.
EZR.9.5	At the evening offering I arose from my [time of] humiliation 
EZR.9.6	and I said, “O my God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift up my face to You, my God, for our wrongdoings have risen higher than our heads and our guilt has grown to the heavens. 
EZR.9.7	Since the days of our fathers to this day we have been exceedingly guilty; and on account of our wrongdoings we, our kings, and our priests have been handed over to the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plundering, and to complete shame, as it is today. 
EZR.9.8	But now for a brief moment grace has been [shown to us] from the L
EZR.9.9	For we are slaves; yet our God has not abandoned us in our bondage, but has extended lovingkindness to us before the kings of Persia, to revive us to rebuild the house of our God, to repair the site of its ruins and to give us a wall [of protection] in Judah and Jerusalem.
EZR.9.10	“Now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have abandoned (turned away from) Your commandments, 
EZR.9.11	which You have commanded by Your servants the prophets, saying, ‘The land which you are entering to possess is a defiled land with the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their repulsive acts which have filled it from one end to the other 
EZR.9.12	So now do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons; and never seek their peace or their prosperity, so that you may be strong and eat the good 
EZR.9.13	And after everything that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt, since You our God have punished us less than our wrongdoings 
EZR.9.14	shall we again break Your commandments and intermarry with the peoples who practice these repulsive acts? Would You not be angry with us to the point of total destruction, so that there would be no remnant nor survivor? 
EZR.9.15	O L
EZR.10.1	Now while Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and laying himself face down before the house of God, a very large group from Israel, of men, women, and children, gathered to him, for the people wept bitterly. 
EZR.10.2	Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, of the sons of Elam, said to Ezra, “We have been unfaithful to our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land; yet now there is hope for Israel in spite of this. 
EZR.10.3	Therefore let us now make a covenant with our God to send away all the [foreign] wives and their children, in accordance with the advice of my lord and of those who tremble [in reverent obedience] at the commandment of our God; and let it be done in accordance with the Law. 
EZR.10.4	Stand up, for it is your duty, and we will be with you. Be brave and act.”
EZR.10.5	Then Ezra stood and made the leaders of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, take an oath that they would act in accordance with this proposal; so they took the oath. 
EZR.10.6	Then Ezra got up from before the house of God and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib [and spent the night there]. He did not eat bread nor drink water, for he was mourning over the [former] exiles’ faithlessness. 
EZR.10.7	They made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the [former] exiles, that they were to assemble at Jerusalem, 
EZR.10.8	and that whoever would not come within three days, by order of the counsel of the leaders and the elders, all his possessions 
EZR.10.9	So all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered at Jerusalem within three days. It was the twentieth [day] of the ninth month, and all the people sat in the open square 
EZR.10.10	Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have been unfaithful [to God] and have married foreign (pagan) women, adding to the guilt of Israel. 
EZR.10.11	So now, make confession to the L
EZR.10.12	Then all the assembly replied with a loud voice, “It is our responsibility to do just as you have said. 
EZR.10.13	But there are many people and it is the season of heavy rain; so we are unable to stand outside. Nor 
EZR.10.14	Let our leaders stand for 
EZR.10.15	Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah 
EZR.10.16	Then the [former] exiles did so. Ezra the priest and men 
EZR.10.17	And by the first day of the first month they finished 
EZR.10.18	Now among the sons of the priests who had married foreign women were found: of the sons of Jeshua [the high priest] the son of Jozadak, and his brothers—Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah. 
EZR.10.19	They vowed to send away their [pagan] wives, and being guilty, 
EZR.10.20	Of the sons of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah; 
EZR.10.21	and of the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah; 
EZR.10.22	and of the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah.
EZR.10.23	Of the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah, that is, Kelita, Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.
EZR.10.24	Of the singers: Eliashib; and of the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem, and Uri.
EZR.10.25	Of Israel, of the sons of Parosh: Ramiah, Izziah, Malchijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malchijah (Hashabiah), and Benaiah; 
EZR.10.26	and of the sons of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Elijah; 
EZR.10.27	and of the sons of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza; 
EZR.10.28	and of the sons also of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai; 
EZR.10.29	and of the sons of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Jeremoth; 
EZR.10.30	and of the sons of Pahath-moab: Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui, and Manasseh; 
EZR.10.31	and of the sons of Harim: Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon, 
EZR.10.32	Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah; 
EZR.10.33	of the sons of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei; 
EZR.10.34	of the sons of Bani: Maadai, Amram, Uel, 
EZR.10.35	Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhi, 
EZR.10.36	Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib, 
EZR.10.37	Mattaniah, Mattenai, Jaasu, 
EZR.10.38	Bani, Binnui, Shimei, 
EZR.10.39	Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah, 
EZR.10.40	Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai, 
EZR.10.41	Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah, 
EZR.10.42	Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph. 
EZR.10.43	Of the sons of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel, and Benaiah. 
EZR.10.44	All these had married foreign women, and some of them had wives 
NEH.1.1	The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah:
NEH.1.2	Hanani, one of my brothers, and some men from Judah came; and I asked them about the surviving Jews who had escaped and survived the captivity, and about Jerusalem. 
NEH.1.3	They said to me, “The remnant there in the province who survived the captivity are in great distress and reproach; the wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its [fortified] gates have been burned (destroyed) by fire.”
NEH.1.4	Now it came about when I heard these words, I sat down and wept and mourned for days; and I was fasting and praying [constantly] before the God of heaven. 
NEH.1.5	And I said, “Please, O L
NEH.1.6	please let Your ear be attentive and Your eyes open to hear the prayer of Your servant which I am praying before You, day and night, on behalf of Your servants, the 
NEH.1.7	We have acted very corruptly against You and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances which You commanded Your servant Moses. 
NEH.1.8	Please remember the word which You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you are unfaithful 
NEH.1.9	but if you return to Me and keep My commandments and do them, though those of you who have been scattered are in the most remote part of the 
NEH.1.10	Now they are Your servants and Your people whom You have redeemed by Your great power and by Your strong hand. 
NEH.1.11	Please, O Lord, let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant and the prayer of Your servants who delight to [reverently] fear Your Name [Your essence, Your nature, Your attributes, with awe]; and make Your servant successful this day and grant him compassion in the sight of this man [the king].”
NEH.2.1	In the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was 
NEH.2.2	So the king said to me, “Why do you look sad when you are not sick? This is nothing but sadness of heart.” Then I was very frightened, 
NEH.2.3	and I said to the king, “Let the king live forever. Why should my face not be sad when the city, the place of my fathers’ tombs, lies desolate and its gates have been consumed by fire?” 
NEH.2.4	The king said to me, “What do you request?” So I prayed to the God of heaven. 
NEH.2.5	I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your presence, [I ask] that you send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ tombs, so that I may rebuild it.” 
NEH.2.6	The king, beside whom the queen was sitting, asked me, “How long will your journey take, and when will you return?” So it pleased the king to send me, and I gave him a definite time [for my return]. 
NEH.2.7	Then I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let letters be given to me for the governors 
NEH.2.8	and a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king’s forest, so that he will give me timber to construct beams for the gates of the fortress which is by the temple, and for the city wall and for the house which I will occupy.” And the king granted me 
NEH.2.9	Then I came to the governors 
NEH.2.10	When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite 
NEH.2.11	So I came to Jerusalem and was there for three days. 
NEH.2.12	Then I got up in the night, I and a few men with me. I did not tell anyone what my God was putting in my heart to do for Jerusalem, and there was no animal with me except the one on which I was riding [so as not to attract attention]. 
NEH.2.13	So I went out at night by the Valley Gate toward the Dragon’s Well and to the Refuse Gate and inspected the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and its gates which were consumed by fire. 
NEH.2.14	Then I passed over to the Fountain Gate and to the King’s Pool, but there was no place for the animal that I was riding to pass. 
NEH.2.15	So I went up at night by the ravine [of Kidron] and inspected the wall; then I turned back and entered [the city] by the Valley Gate, and returned. 
NEH.2.16	The officials did not know where I had gone or what I had done; nor had I yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, or the rest who did the work.
NEH.2.17	Then I said to them, “You see the bad situation that we are in—how Jerusalem is desolate 
NEH.2.18	Then I told them how the hand of my God had been favorable to me and also about the words that the king had spoken to me. And they said, “Let us 
NEH.2.19	But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked us and regarded us with contempt and said, “What is this thing you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?” 
NEH.2.20	I answered them, “The God of heaven [has appointed us for His purpose and] will give us success; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no portion, right, or memorial in Jerusalem.”
NEH.3.1	Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brothers the priests and built 
NEH.3.2	Next to Eliashib the men of Jericho built, and next to them Zaccur the son of Imri built.
NEH.3.3	Now the sons of Hassenaah built the Fish Gate; they laid its beams and set up its doors with its bolts and its bars. 
NEH.3.4	Next to them Meremoth the son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz, made repairs. Next to him Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabel, made repairs. And next to him Zadok the son of Baana 
NEH.3.5	Next to him the men of Tekoa made repairs, but their nobles did not 
NEH.3.6	Joiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah repaired 
NEH.3.7	Next to them Melatiah the Gibeonite and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon and of Mizpah, made repairs for the official seat (Jerusalem residence) of the governor [of the province] beyond the [Euphrates] River. 
NEH.3.8	Next to them Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs. Next to him Hananiah, one of the perfumers, made repairs, and they restored Jerusalem as far as 
NEH.3.9	Next to them Rephaiah the son of Hur, official of half the district of Jerusalem, made repairs. 
NEH.3.10	Next to them Jedaiah the son of Harumaph made repairs opposite his own house. And next to him Hattush the son of Hashabneiah made repairs. 
NEH.3.11	Malchijah the son of Harim and Hasshub the son of Pahath-moab repaired another section and the Tower of the Furnaces. 
NEH.3.12	Next to him Shallum the son of Hallohesh, the official of half the district of Jerusalem, made repairs, he and his daughters.
NEH.3.13	Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate. They built it and set up its doors with its bolts and its bars, and 
NEH.3.14	Malchijah the son of Rechab, the official of the district of Beth-haccherem repaired the Refuse Gate. He rebuilt it and set its doors with its bolts and its bars.
NEH.3.15	Shallum the son of Col-hozeh, official of the district of Mizpah repaired the 
NEH.3.16	After him 
NEH.3.17	After him the Levites carried out repairs 
NEH.3.18	After him their brothers carried out repairs 
NEH.3.19	Next to him Ezer the son of Jeshua, the official of Mizpah, repaired another section [northward] in front of the ascent to the armory at the Angle [in the wall]. 
NEH.3.20	After him Baruch son of Zabbai zealously repaired another section [toward the hill], from the Angle [in the wall] to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest. 
NEH.3.21	After him Meremoth the son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz, repaired another [eastern] section, from the door of Eliashib’s house as far as the end of his house. 
NEH.3.22	After him the priests, the men of the [lower Jordan] valley, carried out repairs. 
NEH.3.23	After them Benjamin and Hasshub made repairs in front of their house. After them Azariah the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ananiah, carried out repairs beside his own house. 
NEH.3.24	After him Binnui the son of Henadad repaired another section [of the wall], from the house of Azariah to the Angle [in the wall] and to the corner. 
NEH.3.25	Palal the son of Uzai 
NEH.3.26	The temple servants were living in Ophel [the hill south of the temple], and they 
NEH.3.27	After them the Tekoites repaired another section in front of the great projecting tower and as far as the wall of Ophel.
NEH.3.28	Above the Horse Gate the priests made repairs, each one in front of his own house. 
NEH.3.29	After them Zadok the son of Immer carried out repairs in front of his house. After him Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah, keeper of the East Gate, repaired 
NEH.3.30	After him Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, repaired another section. After him Meshullam the son of Berechiah carried out repairs in front of his own quarters. 
NEH.3.31	After him Malchijah, one of the goldsmiths, carried out repairs as far as the house of the temple servants and of the merchants, in front of the 
NEH.3.32	Between the upper room of the corner and 
NEH.4.2	He spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Can they restore it for themselves? Can they offer sacrifices? Can they finish in a day? Can they revive the stones from the heaps of dust 
NEH.4.3	Now Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and he said, “Even what they are building—if a fox should get up on it, he would break down their stone wall.”
NEH.4.4	[And Nehemiah prayed] Hear, O our God, how we are despised! Return their taunts on their own heads. Give them up as prey in a land of captivity. 
NEH.4.5	Do not forgive their wrongdoing and do not let their sin be wiped out before You, for they have offended the builders [and provoked You].
NEH.4.6	So we built the wall and the entire wall was joined together to half its 
NEH.4.8	They all conspired together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to cause a disturbance in it.
NEH.4.9	But we prayed to our God, and because of them we set up a guard against them day and night.
NEH.4.10	Then [the leaders of] Judah said,
NEH.4.10	“The strength of the burden bearers is failing,
NEH.4.10	And there is much rubble;
NEH.4.10	We ourselves are unable
NEH.4.10	To rebuild the wall.”
NEH.4.11	Our enemies said, “They will not know or see us until we are among them, kill them and put a stop to the work.” 
NEH.4.12	When the Jews who lived near them came, they said to us ten times (repeatedly), “From every place you turn, they will come up against us.” 
NEH.4.13	So I stationed 
NEH.4.14	When I saw 
NEH.4.15	Now when our enemies heard that we knew about 
NEH.4.16	From that day on, half of my servants carried on the work while the other half held the spears, shields, bows, and breastplates; and the captains were behind the whole house of Judah. 
NEH.4.17	Those who were rebuilding the wall and those who carried burdens loaded themselves 
NEH.4.18	Every builder 
NEH.4.19	I said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, “The work is great and extensive, and we are separated on the wall, far from one another. 
NEH.4.20	Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, gather to us there. Our God will fight for us.”
NEH.4.21	So we carried on with the work with half of them holding spears from dawn until the stars came out. 
NEH.4.22	At that time I also said to the people, “Let each man with his servant spend the night inside Jerusalem so that they may serve as a guard for us at night and a laborer during the day.” 
NEH.4.23	So neither I, my brothers (relatives), my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us took off our clothes; each took his weapon [even] to the water.
NEH.5.1	Now there was a great outcry of the [poorer] people and their wives against their Jewish brothers [to whom they were deeply in debt]. 
NEH.5.2	For there were some who were saying, “We, 
NEH.5.3	There were 
NEH.5.4	There were also 
NEH.5.5	Now our flesh (skin) is the same as that of our brothers (relatives), and our children are like their children, yet here we are forcing (selling) our sons and our daughters to be slaves; and some of our daughters are forced into bondage 
NEH.5.6	Then I was very angry when I heard their outcry and these words [of accusation]. 
NEH.5.7	I thought it over and then challenged the nobles and the rulers. I said to them, “You are exacting usury (excessive interest) from your own brother (relative).” So I held a great assembly to confront them. 
NEH.5.8	I said to them, “According to our ability we have redeemed (purchased back) our Jewish brothers who were sold to the [Gentile] nations; now would you even sell your brothers, that they might be sold to us?” Then they were silent and could not find a [single] word 
NEH.5.9	So I said, “What you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God to prevent the taunting by the [pagan] nations, our enemies? 
NEH.5.10	And likewise I, my brothers, and my servants are lending them money and grain. Please, let us stop [charging] this interest. 
NEH.5.11	Please, give back to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, and also a hundredth part of the money, the grain, the new wine, and the oil that you are lending them.” 
NEH.5.12	Then they said, “We will give it back and not require anything from them. We will do exactly as you say.” Then I called the priests and took an oath from them that they would act in accordance with this promise. 
NEH.5.13	I also 
NEH.5.14	Moreover, from the day that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, for twelve years, neither I nor my relatives have eaten the governor’s food 
NEH.5.15	But the former governors who were [in office] before me put heavy burdens on the people and took food and wine from them in addition to forty shekels of silver [as an excessive monthly salary]; even their servants assumed authority over the people. But I did not do so because of the [reverent] fear of God. 
NEH.5.16	I also applied myself to the work on this wall; we did not buy any land, and all my servants were gathered together there for the work. 
NEH.5.17	Moreover, there were at my table a hundred and fifty Jews and officials, besides those who came to us from the nations that were around us. 
NEH.5.18	Now the following were prepared for each day: one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls (poultry) were prepared for me; and in intervals of ten days all sorts of wine 
NEH.5.19	Remember me, O my God, for good, 
NEH.6.1	Now when Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall, and that there was no breach left in it, although at that time I had not set up doors in the gates, 
NEH.6.2	Sanballat and Geshem sent 
NEH.6.3	So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work and cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave to come down to [meet with] you?” 
NEH.6.4	They sent 
NEH.6.5	Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in the same way the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand. 
NEH.6.6	In it was written, “It is reported among the [neighboring] nations, and Gashmu is saying that you and the Jews are planning to revolt, and that is the reason you are rebuilding the wall. And according to these reports, you are to be their king. 
NEH.6.7	Also [it is reported that] you have appointed prophets to make a proclamation concerning you in Jerusalem, saying, ‘There is a king in Judah!’ And now these things will be reported to the [Persian] king. So come now, and let us consult together.” 
NEH.6.8	I sent 
NEH.6.9	For they all wanted to frighten us, thinking, “They will become discouraged with the work and it will not be done.” But now, [O God,] strengthen my hands.
NEH.6.10	When I went into the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was 
NEH.6.11	But I said, “Should a man like me flee [in fear and hide]? Should 
NEH.6.12	Then I realized that God had not sent him, but he spoke this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. 
NEH.6.13	He was hired for this reason, that I would be frightened and do as he said and sin, so that they would have [grounds to make] a malicious report in order to censure 
NEH.6.14	Remember, O My God, Tobiah and Sanballat in regard to these actions of theirs, and also [remember] the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who were 
NEH.6.15	So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth [day] of [the month] Elul, in fifty-two days. 
NEH.6.16	When all our enemies heard 
NEH.6.17	Moreover, in those days many letters went from the nobles of Judah to Tobiah, and Tobiah’s 
NEH.6.18	For 
NEH.6.19	Also, they were speaking about Tobiah’s good deeds in my presence, and reporting to him what I said. Then Tobiah sent letters to frighten me.
NEH.7.1	Now when the wall had been rebuilt and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers, singers, and Levites had been appointed, 
NEH.7.2	I put my brother Hanani, with Hananiah the commander of the fortress, in charge of Jerusalem, for Hananiah was a more faithful and God-fearing man than many [of the others]. 
NEH.7.3	I said to them, “Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the 
NEH.7.4	Now the city was spacious and large, but there were few people in it and the houses had not [yet] been built.
NEH.7.5	Then my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials, and the people to be registered by genealogy. Then I found the register of the genealogy of those who came [from Babylon] first, and I found the following record:
NEH.7.6	These are the sons (descendants, people) of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had deported [to Babylon]; they returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, each to his city, 
NEH.7.7	the ones who came with 
NEH.7.8	the sons of Parosh, 2,172; 
NEH.7.9	the sons of Shephatiah, 372; 
NEH.7.10	the sons of Arah, 652; 
NEH.7.11	the sons of Pahath-moab of the sons of Jeshua and Joab, 2,818; 
NEH.7.12	the sons of Elam, 1,254; 
NEH.7.13	the sons of Zattu, 845; 
NEH.7.14	the sons of Zaccai, 760; 
NEH.7.15	the sons of Binnui, 648; 
NEH.7.16	the sons of Bebai, 628; 
NEH.7.17	the sons of Azgad, 2,322;

NEH.7.60	All the temple servants and the sons of Solomon’s servants, 
NEH.7.61	And these were the ones who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon and Immer; but they [had no birth records and] could not prove their fathers’ houses or their descent, whether they were of Israel: 
NEH.7.62	the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, 642. 
NEH.7.63	Of the priests: the sons of Hobaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, and the sons of Barzillai, who [was so named because he had] married one of the daughters of Barzillai, the [well-known] Gileadite, and was named after them. 
NEH.7.64	These men searched for their ancestral registration 
NEH.7.65	The governor told them that they should not eat any of the most holy food until a priest arose with 
NEH.7.66	The entire assembly together was 42,360, 
NEH.7.67	besides their male and their female servants, of whom 
NEH.7.68	Their horses were 736; their mules, 245; 
NEH.7.69	 camels, 435; 
NEH.7.70	Some from among the heads of fathers’ 
NEH.7.71	Some of the heads of fathers’ 
NEH.7.72	And what the rest of the people gave was 20,000 gold drachmas, 2,000 silver minas, and 67 priests’ garments.
NEH.7.73	So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple servants, along with all Israel, lived in their cities.
NEH.8.1	Then all the people gathered together as one man at the open square in front of the Water Gate; and they asked Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the Law of Moses which the L
NEH.8.2	So Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly of men, women and all who 
NEH.8.3	Then he read from it, in front of the open square which was in front of the Water Gate, from 
NEH.8.4	Ezra the scribe stood on a [large] wooden platform which they had constructed for this purpose. And beside him [on the platform] stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right; and Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam on his left. 
NEH.8.5	Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was standing above them; and when he opened it, all the people stood up. 
NEH.8.6	Then Ezra blessed the L
NEH.8.7	Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, explained the Law to the people, and the people 
NEH.8.8	So they read from the Book of the Law of God, translating and explaining it so that the people understood the reading.
NEH.8.9	Then Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, “This day is holy to the L
NEH.8.10	Then Ezra said to them, “Go [your way], eat the rich festival food, drink the sweet 
NEH.8.11	So the Levites quieted all the people, saying, “Be still, for the day is holy; do not be worried.” 
NEH.8.12	Then all the people went on their way to eat, to drink, to send portions [of food to others] and to celebrate a great festival, because they understood the words which had been 
NEH.8.13	On the second day, all of the heads of fathers’ 
NEH.8.14	They found written in the Law how the L
NEH.8.15	So they proclaimed and published an announcement in all their cities and in Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the hills and bring olive branches, wild olive, myrtle, palm, and other leafy branches to make booths, as it is written.” 
NEH.8.16	So the people went out and brought them and made booths for themselves, each on the roof 
NEH.8.17	The entire assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made booths and lived in them. Indeed since the days of Joshua the son of Nun until that 
NEH.8.18	Every day, from the first day to the last, Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God. They celebrated the feast for seven days; on the eighth day 
NEH.9.1	Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the Israelites assembled with fasting and in sackcloth and with dirt 
NEH.9.2	The 
NEH.9.3	While they stood in their places, they read from the Book of the Law of the L
NEH.9.4	On the platform of the Levites stood Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and they called out with a loud voice to the L
NEH.9.5	Then the Levites—Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah—said, “Stand up and bless (praise, honor) the L
NEH.9.5	May Your glorious name be blessed
NEH.9.5	And exalted above all blessing and praise.”
NEH.9.6	[And Ezra said],
NEH.9.6	“You are the L
NEH.9.6	You have made the heavens,
NEH.9.6	The heaven of heavens with all their host (the heavenly bodies),
NEH.9.6	The earth and everything that is on it,
NEH.9.6	The seas and everything that is in them.
NEH.9.6	You give life to all of them,
NEH.9.6	And the heavenly host is bowing down [in worship] to You.
NEH.9.7	You are the L
NEH.9.7	Who chose Abram
NEH.9.7	And brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees,
NEH.9.7	And gave him the name Abraham.
NEH.9.8	You found his heart to be faithful 
NEH.9.8	And You 
NEH.9.8	To give him the land of the Canaanite,
NEH.9.8	Of the Hittite, of the Amorite,
NEH.9.8	Of the Perizzite, the Jebusite, and the Girgashite—
NEH.9.8	To give it to his descendants.
NEH.9.8	And You have fulfilled Your promise,
NEH.9.8	For You are righteous 
NEH.9.9	“You saw our fathers’ affliction in Egypt,
NEH.9.9	And You heard their cry by the Red Sea (Sea of Reeds).
NEH.9.10	Then You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh,
NEH.9.10	Against all his servants and all the people of his land;
NEH.9.10	For You knew that they behaved arrogantly toward them (the Israelites),
NEH.9.10	And You made a name for Yourself, as it is to this day.
NEH.9.11	You divided the sea before them,
NEH.9.11	So that they passed through the midst of the sea on dry land;
NEH.9.11	You hurled their pursuers into the depths,
NEH.9.11	Like a stone into mighty 
NEH.9.12	And with a pillar of cloud You led them by day,
NEH.9.12	And with a pillar of fire by night
NEH.9.12	To light the way for them
NEH.9.12	In which they were to go.
NEH.9.13	Then You came down on Mount Sinai,
NEH.9.13	And spoke with them from heaven;
NEH.9.13	And You gave them fair ordinances and true laws,
NEH.9.13	Good statutes and commandments.
NEH.9.14	So You made known to them Your holy Sabbath,
NEH.9.14	And gave them commandments, statutes, and law,
NEH.9.15	You gave them bread from heaven for their hunger,
NEH.9.15	And brought water for them out of a rock for their thirst,
NEH.9.15	And You told them to enter and take possession of
NEH.9.15	The land that You 
NEH.9.16	“But they, our fathers, acted arrogantly;
NEH.9.16	They stiffened their necks and would not heed Your commandments.
NEH.9.17	They refused to listen 
NEH.9.17	And did not remember Your wondrous acts which You had performed among them;
NEH.9.17	So they stiffened their necks and [in their rebellion] appointed a leader in order to return them to slavery in Egypt.
NEH.9.17	But You are a God of forgiveness,
NEH.9.17	Gracious and merciful 
NEH.9.17	And You did not abandon them.
NEH.9.18	Even when they had made for themselves
NEH.9.18	A 
NEH.9.18	And said, ‘This is your god
NEH.9.18	Who brought you up from Egypt,’
NEH.9.18	And committed great [and contemptible] blasphemies,
NEH.9.19	You, in Your great mercy 
NEH.9.19	Did not abandon them in the wilderness;
NEH.9.19	The pillar of the cloud did not leave them by day,
NEH.9.19	To lead them in the way,
NEH.9.19	Nor the pillar of fire by night, to light for them the way they should go.
NEH.9.20	You [also] gave Your good Spirit to instruct them,
NEH.9.20	You did not withhold Your manna from their mouth,
NEH.9.20	And You gave them water for their thirst.
NEH.9.21	Indeed, for forty years You sustained them in the wilderness; they lacked nothing,
NEH.9.21	Their clothes did not wear out, and their feet did not swell.
NEH.9.22	You also gave them kingdoms and peoples,
NEH.9.22	And You allotted 
NEH.9.22	So they took possession of the land of Sihon king of Heshbon
NEH.9.22	And the land of Og king of Bashan.
NEH.9.23	You made their children as numerous as the stars of heaven,
NEH.9.23	And You brought them into the land
NEH.9.23	Which You told their fathers to enter and possess.
NEH.9.24	So their sons (descendants) went in and took possession of the land;
NEH.9.24	And You subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites,
NEH.9.24	And You gave them into their hand, with their kings and the peoples of the land,
NEH.9.24	To do with them as they pleased.
NEH.9.25	They captured fortified cities and a fertile land.
NEH.9.25	They took possession of houses full of all good things,
NEH.9.25	Hewn cisterns, vineyards, olive groves,
NEH.9.25	And 
NEH.9.25	So they ate and were filled and became fat,
NEH.9.25	And they reveled 
NEH.9.26	“Yet they were disobedient and rebelled against You,
NEH.9.26	And cast Your law behind their backs
NEH.9.26	And killed Your prophets who warned them
NEH.9.26	To return to You;
NEH.9.26	And they committed great [and contemptible] blasphemies.
NEH.9.27	Therefore You handed them over to their enemies who oppressed them.
NEH.9.27	You heard them from heaven, and according to Your great compassion You gave them 
NEH.9.27	Who rescued them from the hand of their enemies.
NEH.9.28	But as soon as they had rest, they again did evil before You;
NEH.9.28	Therefore You abandoned them into the hand of their enemies, so that they ruled over them.
NEH.9.28	Yet when they turned and cried out again to You, You heard them from heaven,
NEH.9.28	And You rescued them many times in accordance with Your compassion,
NEH.9.29	And You admonished them 
NEH.9.29	Yet they acted presumptuously 
NEH.9.29	Which by keeping, a man will live.
NEH.9.29	But they turned a stubborn shoulder, stiffened their neck, and would not listen.
NEH.9.30	Yet You were patient with them for many years,
NEH.9.30	And admonished them 
NEH.9.30	Still they would not 
NEH.9.30	Therefore You gave them into the hand (power) of the peoples of the lands.
NEH.9.31	Yet in Your great compassion You did not utterly destroy them or abandon them,
NEH.9.31	For You are a gracious and merciful God.
NEH.9.32	“Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps the covenant and lovingkindness,
NEH.9.32	Do not let all the hardship seem insignificant before You,
NEH.9.32	Which has come upon us, our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our fathers and on all Your people,
NEH.9.32	Since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day.
NEH.9.33	However, You are just 
NEH.9.33	For You have dealt faithfully, but we have acted wickedly.
NEH.9.34	Our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept Your law
NEH.9.34	Or paid attention to Your commandments and Your warnings which You have given them.
NEH.9.35	But they, in their kingdom,
NEH.9.35	With Your great goodness which You gave them,
NEH.9.35	With the broad and rich land which You set before them,
NEH.9.35	Did not serve You or turn from their wicked deeds.
NEH.9.36	Behold, we are slaves today,
NEH.9.36	And as for the land which You gave our fathers, to eat of its fruit and its goodness,
NEH.9.36	Behold, we are slaves in it.
NEH.9.37	Its abundant produce is for the kings
NEH.9.37	Whom You have set over us because of our sins;
NEH.9.37	They also rule over our bodies
NEH.9.37	And over our cattle as they please,
NEH.9.37	So we are in great distress.
NEH.9.38	“
NEH.9.38	We are making an agreement in writing;
NEH.9.38	And on the sealed document 
NEH.10.2	Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah, 
NEH.10.3	Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah, 
NEH.10.4	Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch, 
NEH.10.5	Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah, 
NEH.10.6	Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch, 
NEH.10.7	Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin, 
NEH.10.8	Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah—these were the priests. 
NEH.10.9	And the Levites: Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel, 
NEH.10.10	and their brothers: Shebaniah, Hodiah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan, 
NEH.10.11	Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah, 
NEH.10.12	Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah, 
NEH.10.13	Hodiah, Bani, Beninu. 
NEH.10.14	The leaders of the people: Parosh, Pahath-moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani, 
NEH.10.15	Bunni, Azgad, Bebai, 
NEH.10.16	Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin, 
NEH.10.17	Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur, 
NEH.10.18	Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai,

NEH.10.25	Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah, 
NEH.10.26	Ahiah, Hanan, Anan, 
NEH.10.27	Malluch, Harim, Baanah.
NEH.10.28	Now the rest of the people—the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple servants, and all those who had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands to the Law of God, their wives, their sons, their daughters, all those who had knowledge and understanding— 
NEH.10.29	are joining with their fellow Israelites, their nobles, and are taking on themselves a curse and an oath to walk in God’s Law, which was given through Moses the servant of God, and to keep and to observe all the commandments of 
NEH.10.30	and that we will not give our daughters [as wives] to the peoples of the land or take their daughters for our sons. 
NEH.10.31	As for the peoples of the land who bring merchandise or any grain on the Sabbath day to sell, we will not buy from them on the Sabbath or on a holy day; and we will give up 
NEH.10.32	Also we pledge ourselves to contribute yearly one third of a shekel for the service [expenses] of the house of our God: 
NEH.10.33	for the showbread; for the continual grain offerings and the continual burnt offerings; [for the offerings on] the Sabbaths, the New Moons, the [feasts at] appointed times; for the holy things, for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel; and for all the work of the house of our God.
NEH.10.34	We have also cast lots—the priests, the Levites, and the people—for [contributing] 
NEH.10.35	and [we obligate ourselves] to bring the first fruits of our ground and the first fruits of all the fruit of every tree to the house of the L
NEH.10.36	as well as the firstborn of our sons and of our cattle, as is written in the Law, and the firstborn of our herds and flocks, to bring to the house of our God, for the priests who minister in the house of our God. 
NEH.10.37	We will bring the first [and best] of our dough, our contributions, the fruit of every tree, the new wine and the [olive] oil to the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God, and the tithe of our ground to the Levites, for the Levites are the ones who receive the tithes in all the 
NEH.10.38	The priest, the son of Aaron, shall be with the Levites when they receive tithes, and they shall bring one-tenth of the tithes up to the house of our God, to the chambers of the storehouse. 
NEH.10.39	For the Israelites and the sons of Levi shall bring the offering of the grain, the new wine, and the oil to the chambers; the utensils of the sanctuary, the priests who are ministering, the gatekeepers, and the singers are there. In this manner, we will not neglect the house of our God.
NEH.11.1	Now the leaders of the people lived in Jerusalem; but the rest of the people cast lots to bring one [person] out of ten to live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while nine-tenths 
NEH.11.2	And the people blessed all the men who volunteered to live in Jerusalem.
NEH.11.3	These are the heads of the provinces who lived in Jerusalem, but in the cities of Judah everyone lived on his property in their cities—the Israelites, the priests, the Levites, the temple servants, and the descendants of Solomon’s servants. 
NEH.11.4	And some of the sons of Judah and some of the sons of Benjamin lived in Jerusalem. From the sons of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the sons of Perez; 
NEH.11.5	Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Col-hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of the Shilonite. 
NEH.11.6	All the sons of Perez who lived at Jerusalem were 468 able men.
NEH.11.7	These are the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, son of Jeshaiah; 
NEH.11.8	and after him Gabbai and Sallai, 928. 
NEH.11.9	Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer, and Judah the son of Hassenuah was second in command of the city.
NEH.11.10	Of the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin, 
NEH.11.11	Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the leader of the house of God, 
NEH.11.12	and their brothers (relatives, fellow workers) who did the work of the house, 822; and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malchijah, 
NEH.11.13	and his brothers, heads of fathers’ 
NEH.11.14	and their brothers, brave men, 128. Their overseer was Zabdiel the son of Haggedolim [one of the great men].
NEH.11.15	Now from the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni; 
NEH.11.16	and Shabbethai and Jozabad, from the leaders of the Levites, who were in charge of the outside work of the house of God; 
NEH.11.17	Mattaniah the son of Mica, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, who was the leader to begin the thanksgiving in prayer, and Bakbukiah, second among his brothers; and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun. 
NEH.11.18	All the Levites in the holy city 
NEH.11.19	The gatekeepers: Akkub, Talmon, and their kinsmen, who kept watch at the gates, 
NEH.11.20	Now the rest of Israel, the priests and the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, each on his own inheritance. 
NEH.11.21	But the temple servants were living in Ophel; Ziha and Gishpa were in charge of the temple servants.
NEH.11.22	The overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica, from Asaph’s sons, who were the singers in regard to the work of the house of God. 
NEH.11.23	For 
NEH.11.24	Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the sons of Zerah the son of Judah, was the king’s representative in all matters concerning the people.
NEH.11.25	As for the villages with their fields, some sons (descendants) of Judah lived in Kiriath-arba and its 
NEH.11.26	in Jeshua, in Moladah, in Beth-pelet, 
NEH.11.27	in Hazar-shual and in Beersheba and its towns, 
NEH.11.28	in Ziklag and in Meconah and its towns, 
NEH.11.29	in En-rimmon, in Zorah, and in Jarmuth, 
NEH.11.30	Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages, Lachish and its fields, and Azekah and its towns. So they camped from Beersheba as far as the Hinnom Valley. 
NEH.11.31	The sons (descendants) of Benjamin also 
NEH.11.32	at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah, 
NEH.11.33	Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim, 
NEH.11.34	Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat, 
NEH.11.35	Lod, and Ono, the Valley of the Craftsmen. 
NEH.11.36	And certain divisions of the Levites in Judah belonged to Benjamin.
NEH.12.1	Now these are the priests and Levites who came up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and with Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, 
NEH.12.2	Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, 
NEH.12.3	Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth, 
NEH.12.4	Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah, 
NEH.12.5	Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah, 
NEH.12.6	Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah, 
NEH.12.7	Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah. These were the heads of the priests and their 
NEH.12.8	The Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah who was in charge of the songs of thanksgiving 
NEH.12.9	Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brothers, stood opposite them in their divisions of service. 
NEH.12.10	Now Jeshua became the father of Joiakim, Joiakim of Eliashib, Eliashib of Joiada, 
NEH.12.11	and Joiada became the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan of Jaddua.
NEH.12.12	And in the days of Joiakim, the priests, the heads of fathers’ 
NEH.12.13	of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan; 
NEH.12.14	of 
NEH.12.15	of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai; 
NEH.12.16	of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam; 
NEH.12.17	of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin and of Moadiah, Piltai; 
NEH.12.18	of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan; 
NEH.12.19	of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi; 
NEH.12.20	of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber; 
NEH.12.21	of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel.
NEH.12.22	As for the Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, the heads of fathers’ 
NEH.12.23	The sons of Levi, heads of fathers’ 
NEH.12.24	The heads of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, and their brothers opposite them, to praise and to give thanks, as commanded by David the man of God, [one] division [singing] in response to [the men in the opposite] division. 
NEH.12.25	Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers keeping watch at the storehouses of the gates. 
NEH.12.26	These men 
NEH.12.27	Now at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought out the Levites from all their places in order to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication with gladness, with hymns of thanksgiving, and with songs 
NEH.12.28	So the sons of the singers gathered together from the district around Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites, 
NEH.12.29	from Beth-gilgal and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built villages for themselves around Jerusalem. 
NEH.12.30	The priests and the Levites purified themselves; they also purified the people, the gates, and the wall.
NEH.12.31	Then I had the leaders of Judah come up on the wall, and I appointed two large thanksgiving choirs, the first one proceeding to the right on top of the wall toward the Refuse Gate. 
NEH.12.32	Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah followed them, 
NEH.12.33	with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 
NEH.12.34	Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah, 
NEH.12.35	and some of the priests’ sons with trumpets, and Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph, 
NEH.12.36	and his brothers, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God. And Ezra the scribe went in front of them. 
NEH.12.37	At the Fountain Gate they went directly up the steps of the City of David by the stairway of the wall above David’s house to the Water Gate on the east.
NEH.12.38	The second 
NEH.12.39	and above the Gate of Ephraim, and by the Old Gate, by the Fish Gate, by the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate; and they stopped at the Gate of the Guard. 
NEH.12.40	Then the two choirs stood in the house of God. So did I, and half of the officials with me; 
NEH.12.41	and the priests Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah and Hananiah, with trumpets; 
NEH.12.42	and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang, with Jezrahiah as their leader. 
NEH.12.43	Also on that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced because God had given them great joy; the women and children also rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard from far away.
NEH.12.44	On that day men were appointed over the chambers for the stores, the contributions, the first fruits, and the tithes, to gather into them from the fields of the cities the portions required by the law for the priests and the Levites; for Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who served. 
NEH.12.45	And they performed the worship of their God and the service of purification; so did the singers and gatekeepers, as David and his son Solomon had commanded. 
NEH.12.46	For in the days of David and Asaph, in ancient times, there were leaders of singers, songs of praise and hymns of thanksgiving to God. 
NEH.12.47	So in the days of Zerubbabel and [later of] Nehemiah, all Israel would give the daily portions for the singers and the gatekeepers; and they set apart the consecrated 
NEH.13.1	On that day they read aloud from the book of Moses so that the people could hear [its words], and in it was found written that 
NEH.13.2	because they did not meet the Israelites with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them. Yet our God turned the curse into a blessing. 
NEH.13.3	When the Jews heard the law, they separated from Israel all who were of foreign descent.
NEH.13.4	Now prior to this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, and was 
NEH.13.5	had prepared for Tobiah a large room (chamber) where previously they had put the grain offerings, the frankincense, the utensils, and the tithes of grain, new wine, and [olive] oil which were given by commandment for the Levites, the singers, and gatekeepers, and the contributions for the priests. 
NEH.13.6	But during all this 
NEH.13.7	and I came to Jerusalem. Then I discovered the evil [thing] that Eliashib had done for Tobiah by preparing a room for him in the courtyards of the house of God. 
NEH.13.8	It was very displeasing to me, so I threw all of Tobiah’s household furnishings out of the room. 
NEH.13.9	Then I gave an order, and they cleaned the rooms; and I put back there the utensils of the house of God with the grain offerings and the frankincense.
NEH.13.10	I also discovered that the portions due the Levites had not been given 
NEH.13.11	Then I reprimanded the officials and said, “Why is the house of God neglected?” So I gathered the Levites and singers together and restored them at their posts. 
NEH.13.12	Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain, the new wine, and the oil to the storehouses. 
NEH.13.13	I appointed [as treasurers] over the storehouses: Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites; assisting them was Hanan son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were considered faithful 
NEH.13.14	O my God, remember me concerning this and do not wipe out my loyal deeds 
NEH.13.15	In those days I saw some in Judah who were treading wine presses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves 
NEH.13.16	Also men of Tyre were living there who brought fish and all kinds of merchandise, and they were selling them to the people of Judah on the Sabbath, even in Jerusalem. 
NEH.13.17	Then I reprimanded the nobles of Judah, and said to them, “What is this evil thing that you are doing—profaning the Sabbath day? 
NEH.13.18	Did your fathers (ancestors) not do the same, and did our God not bring all this trouble on us and on this city? Yet you are adding to the wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.”
NEH.13.19	Now when it began to get dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath [began], I commanded that the doors be shut and not be opened until after the Sabbath. Then I stationed some of my servants at the gates so that no load [of merchandise] would enter [Jerusalem] on the Sabbath day. 
NEH.13.20	So once or twice the merchants and sellers of every kind of merchandise spent the night outside Jerusalem. 
NEH.13.21	But I warned them, saying, “Why do you spend the night by the wall? If you do so again, I will 
NEH.13.22	And I commanded the Levites to purify themselves and come and guard the gates to keep the Sabbath day holy. O my God, remember me 
NEH.13.23	In those days I also saw Jews who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. 
NEH.13.24	As for their children, half spoke in the language of Ashdod, and none of them knew how to speak [Hebrew] the language of Judah, but only the language of his own people. 
NEH.13.25	So I contended with them and cursed them and struck some of them and pulled out their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, “You shall not give your daughters [in marriage] to their sons, nor take [any of] their daughters for your sons or for yourselves. 
NEH.13.26	Did not Solomon king of Israel sin [greatly against God] regarding these things? Yet among the many nations there was no king like him. He was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel; nevertheless the foreign women caused even him to sin [by turning to other gods and so, judged by God, he lost his kingdom]. 
NEH.13.27	Do we then hear about you that you have done all this great evil, acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign (pagan) women?” 
NEH.13.28	One of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite, so I chased him away from me. 
NEH.13.29	O my God, remember them, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.
NEH.13.30	Thus I cleansed 
NEH.13.31	and 
EST.1.1	It was in the days of Ahasuerus (
EST.1.2	in those days when King Ahasuerus sat on his royal throne which was at the citadel in 
EST.1.3	in the third year of his reign he held a banquet for all his officials and his attendants. The army 
EST.1.4	And he displayed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the splendor of his great majesty for many days, 180 days 
EST.1.5	When these days were completed, the king held a banquet for all the people who were present at the citadel in Susa [the capital], from the greatest [in importance] to the least, a seven-day feast in the courtyard of the garden of the king’s palace. 
EST.1.6	 (draperies) of fine white and violet linen fastened with cords of fine purple linen to silver rings and marble columns. The couches of gold and silver 
EST.1.7	Drinks were served in various kinds of golden goblets, and the royal wine was plentiful, in accordance with the generosity of the king. 
EST.1.8	The drinking was 
EST.1.9	Queen Vashti also held a [separate] banquet for the women in the palace of King Ahasuerus.
EST.1.10	On the seventh day, when the king’s heart was joyful with wine (in high spirits), he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carkas, the seven 
EST.1.11	to bring Queen Vashti before the king, 
EST.1.12	But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s command, which was delivered [to her] by the eunuchs. So the king became extremely angry and burned with rage.
EST.1.13	Then the king spoke to the wise men who understood the times [asking for their advice]—for it was the custom of the king 
EST.1.14	and who were close to him [as advisors]: Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven officials of Persia and Media who had access to the king and were ranked highest in the kingdom. 
EST.1.15	[He said,] “According to the law, what is to be done with Queen Vashti because she did not obey the command of King Ahasuerus 
EST.1.16	And Memucan answered in the presence of the king and the officials, “Vashti the queen has not only wronged the king but [also] all the officials (royal representatives) and all the peoples who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus. 
EST.1.17	For the queen’s conduct will become known to all women, causing them to look on their husbands with contempt (disrespect), since they will say, ‘King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she did not come.’ 
EST.1.18	This [very] day the ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen’s refusal will speak [in the same way] to all the king’s officials, and there will be plenty of contempt and anger. 
EST.1.19	If it pleases the king, let a royal command be issued by him and let it be written in the laws of the Persians and Medes so that it cannot be repealed 
EST.1.20	So when the king’s great decree is proclaimed throughout his [extensive] kingdom, all women will give honor to their husbands, from the great to the insignificant.”
EST.1.21	This statement (advice) pleased the king and the officials, and the king did what Memucan proposed. 
EST.1.22	So he sent letters to all the royal provinces, to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language, saying that every man should be the master 
EST.2.1	After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus (Xerxes) had subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decreed against her. 
EST.2.2	Then the king’s attendants, who served him, said, “Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king. 
EST.2.3	Let the king appoint administrators in all the provinces of his kingdom, and have them gather all the beautiful young virgins to the citadel in Susa, into the harem, under the custody of Hegai, the king’s eunuch, who is in charge of the women; and let their beauty preparations be given 
EST.2.4	Then let the young woman who pleases the king be queen in place of Vashti.” This pleased the king, and he did accordingly.
EST.2.5	There was a certain Jew in the citadel of Susa whose name was Mordecai the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite, 
EST.2.6	who had been deported from Jerusalem with the captives who had been exiled with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had exiled. 
EST.2.7	He was the guardian of 
EST.2.8	So it came about when the king’s command and his decree were proclaimed and when many young women were gathered together in the citadel of Susa into the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken to the king’s palace [and placed] in the custody of Hegai, who was in charge of the women. 
EST.2.9	Now the young woman pleased Hegai and found favor with him. So he quickly provided her with beauty preparations and her [portion of] food, and he gave her seven choice maids from the king’s palace; then he transferred her and her maids to the best 
EST.2.10	Esther did not reveal [the Jewish background of] her people or her family, for Mordecai had instructed her not to do so. 
EST.2.11	Every day Mordecai [who was an 
EST.2.12	Now when it was each young woman’s turn to go before King Ahasuerus, after the end of her twelve months under the regulations for the women—for the days of their beautification were completed as follows: six months with oil of myrrh and six months with [sweet] spices 
EST.2.13	then the young woman would go before the king in this way: anything that she wanted was given her to take with her from the harem into the king’s palace. 
EST.2.14	In the evening she would go in and the next morning she would return to the 
EST.2.15	Now 
EST.2.16	So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus, to his royal palace in the tenth month, that is, the month of Tebeth (Dec-Jan), in the seventh year of his reign.
EST.2.17	Now the king loved Esther more than all the 
EST.2.18	Then the king held a great banquet, Esther’s banquet, for all his officials and his servants; and he made a 
EST.2.19	And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai 
EST.2.20	Esther had not revealed her family or her people [that is, her Jewish background], just as Mordecai had instructed her; for Esther did what Mordecai told her just as when she was under his care.
EST.2.21	In those days, while Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who guarded the door, became 
EST.2.22	But the plot became known to Mordecai, who informed Queen Esther, and Esther told the king in Mordecai’s name. 
EST.2.23	Now when the plot was investigated and found 
EST.3.1	After these things King Ahasuerus (Xerxes) promoted Haman, the son of Hammedatha the 
EST.3.2	All the king’s servants who were at the king’s gate [in royal service] bowed down and honored 
EST.3.3	Then the king’s servants who were at the king’s gate said to Mordecai, “Why are you disregarding the king’s command?” 
EST.3.4	Now it happened when they had spoken to him day after day and he would not listen to them, that they told Haman to see whether Mordecai’s reason [for his behavior] would stand [as valid]; for he had told them that he was a Jew. 
EST.3.5	When Haman saw that Mordecai neither bowed down nor paid homage to him, he was furious. 
EST.3.6	But he disdained laying hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him 
EST.3.7	In the first month, the month of Nisan (Mar-Apr), in the 
EST.3.8	Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered [abroad] and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from 
EST.3.9	If it pleases the king, let it be decreed that they be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who carry out the 
EST.3.10	Then the king removed his signet ring from his hand [that is, the special ring which was used to seal his letters] and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews. 
EST.3.11	The king said to Haman, “The silver is given to you, and the people 
EST.3.12	Then the king’s scribes (secretaries) were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and it was written just as Haman commanded to the king’s satraps (chief rulers), and to the governors who were over each province and to the officials of each people, each province according to its script (writing), each people according to their own language; being written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king’s signet ring. 
EST.3.13	Letters were sent by couriers to all the king’s provinces to destroy, to kill and to annihilate all the Jews, both young and old, women and children, in one day, the thirteenth [day] of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar (March 7, 473 
EST.3.14	A copy of the edict to be decreed as law in every province was published to all the peoples, so that they would be ready for this day. 
EST.3.15	The couriers went out hurriedly by order of the king, and the decree was issued at the citadel in Susa. And while the king and Haman sat down to drink, the city of Susa was perplexed [by the unusual and alarming decree].
EST.4.1	Now when Mordecai learned of everything that had been done, he tore his clothes [in mourning], and put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the center of the city and cried out loudly and bitterly. 
EST.4.2	He went [only] as far as the king’s gate, because no one was to enter the king’s gate dressed in sackcloth. 
EST.4.3	In each and every province that the decree and law of the king reached, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping and wailing; and many lay on sackcloth and ashes.
EST.4.4	When Esther’s maids and her eunuchs came and told her [what had happened], the queen was seized by great fear. She sent garments to clothe Mordecai so that he would remove his sackcloth, but he did not accept them. 
EST.4.5	Then Esther summoned Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs, whom the king had appointed to attend her, and ordered him 
EST.4.6	So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the [open] square of the city, which was in front of the king’s gate. 
EST.4.7	Mordecai told him everything that had happened to him, and the exact 
EST.4.8	Mordecai also gave him a copy of the text of the decree which had been issued in Susa for the Jews destruction, so that he might show Esther and explain it to her, and order her to go in to the king to seek his favor and plead with him for [the lives of] her people.
EST.4.9	Hathach came back and told Esther what Mordecai had said. 
EST.4.10	Then Esther spoke to Hathach and ordered him 
EST.4.11	“All the king’s servants and the people of the king’s provinces know that for any man or woman who comes to the king to the inner court without being summoned, he has but one law, that he is to be put to death, unless the king holds out to him the golden scepter so that he may live. And as for me, I have not been summoned to come to the king for these [last] thirty days.” 
EST.4.12	So they told Mordecai what Esther had said.
EST.4.13	Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, “Do not imagine that you in the king’s palace can escape any more than all the Jews. 
EST.4.14	For if you remain silent at this time, liberation and rescue will arise for the Jews from another place, and you and your father’s house will perish [since you did not help when you had the chance]. And who knows whether you have attained royalty for such a time as this [and for this very purpose]?”
EST.4.15	Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai, 
EST.4.16	“Go, gather all the Jews that are present in Susa, and observe a fast for me; do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my maids also will fast in the same way. Then I will go in to [see] the king [without being summoned], which is against the law; and if I perish, I perish.” 
EST.4.17	So Mordecai went away and did exactly as Esther had commanded him.
EST.5.1	On the third day [of the fast] Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king’s palace opposite his [throne] room. The king was sitting on his royal throne, facing the [main] entrance of the palace. 
EST.5.2	When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she found favor in his sight; and the king extended to her the golden scepter which was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the top of the scepter. 
EST.5.3	Then the king said to her, “What is 
EST.5.4	Esther said, “If it pleases the king, may the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him.”
EST.5.5	Then the king said, “Bring Haman quickly so that we may do as Esther says.” So the king and Haman came to the banquet which Esther had prepared. 
EST.5.6	As they drank their wine at the banquet, the king said to Esther, “What is your 
EST.5.7	Then Esther replied, “My petition and my request is this: 
EST.5.8	if I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and to do as I request, may the king and Haman come to the banquet that I will prepare for them; and tomorrow I will do as the king says [and express my request].”
EST.5.9	Haman went away that day joyful and in good spirits. But when he saw Mordecai at the king’s gate refusing to stand up or show fear before him, he was filled with rage toward Mordecai. 
EST.5.10	Nevertheless, Haman controlled himself and went home. There he sent for his friends and his wife Zeresh. 
EST.5.11	Then Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, the large number of his sons, and every 
EST.5.12	Haman also said, “Even Queen Esther let no one but me come with the king to the banquet she had prepared; and tomorrow also I am invited by her [together] with the king. 
EST.5.13	Yet all of this does not satisfy me as long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.” 
EST.5.14	Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, “Have a gallows 
EST.6.1	On that night 
EST.6.2	It was found written there how Mordecai had reported that Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who were doorkeepers, had planned to 
EST.6.3	The king said, “What honor or distinction has been given Mordecai for this?” Then the king’s servants who attended him said, “Nothing has been done for him.” 
EST.6.4	So the king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king’s palace to ask the king about 
EST.6.5	The king’s servants said to him, “Look, Haman is standing in the court.” And the king said, “Let him come in.” 
EST.6.6	So Haman came in and the king said to him, “What is to be done for the man whom the king desires to honor?” Now Haman thought 
EST.6.7	So Haman said to the king, “For the man whom the king desires to honor, 
EST.6.8	let a royal robe be brought which the king has worn, and the horse on which the king has ridden, and on whose head a royal crown has been placed; 
EST.6.9	and let the robe and the horse be handed over to one of the king’s most noble officials. Let him dress the man whom the king delights to honor [in the royal robe] and lead him on horseback through the open square of the city, and proclaim before him, ‘This is what shall be done for the man whom the king desires to honor.’ ”
EST.6.10	Then the king said to Haman, “Quickly take the royal robe and the horse, as you have said, and do this for Mordecai the Jew, who is sitting at the king’s gate. Leave out nothing of all that you have said.” 
EST.6.11	So Haman took the royal robe and the horse and dressed Mordecai, and led him 
EST.6.12	Then Mordecai returned to the king’s gate. But Haman hurried to his [own] house, mourning and with his head covered [in sorrow]. 
EST.6.13	Then Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise counselors and his wife Zeresh said to him, “If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall 
EST.6.14	While they were still speaking with him, the king’s eunuchs (attendants) arrived and hurriedly brought Haman to the banquet which Esther had prepared.
EST.7.1	So the king and Haman came to drink 
EST.7.2	And the king said to Esther on the second day also as they drank their wine, “What is your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted to you. And what is your request? Even to half of the kingdom, it shall be done.” 
EST.7.3	Then Queen Esther replied, “If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be spared as my petition, and my people [be spared] as my request; 
EST.7.4	for we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, killed and wiped out of existence. Now if we had only been sold as slaves, men and women, I would have remained silent, for our hardship would not be sufficient to burden the king [by even mentioning it].” 
EST.7.5	Then King Ahasuerus (Xerxes) asked Queen Esther, “Who is he, and where is he, who dares to do such a thing?” 
EST.7.6	Esther said, “An adversary and an enemy is Haman, this evil man.” Then Haman became terrified before the king and queen.
EST.7.7	Then in his fury, the king stood up from drinking wine 
EST.7.8	When the king returned from the palace garden to the place where they were drinking wine, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, “Will he even 
EST.7.9	Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs serving the king said, “Now look, there are gallows fifty cubits (75 ft.) high standing at Haman’s house, which Haman made for Mordecai, whose good warning saved the king.” And the king said, “Hang him on it.” 
EST.7.10	So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king’s anger subsided.
EST.8.1	On that day King Ahasuerus (Xerxes) gave the 
EST.8.2	The king took off his signet ring which he had taken away from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther put Mordecai in charge of the house of Haman.
EST.8.3	Then Esther spoke again to the king and fell down at his feet and wept and implored him to avert the evil 
EST.8.4	Then the king held out to Esther the golden scepter. So Esther arose and stood before the king. 
EST.8.5	Then she said, “If it pleases the king and if I have found favor before him and the matter is proper in the king’s view and I am pleasing in his sight, let it be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, which he wrote [in order] to destroy the Jews who are in all the king’s provinces. 
EST.8.6	For how can I endure to see the tragedy that will happen to my people? Or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?” 
EST.8.7	Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows because he stretched out his hand against the Jews.
EST.8.8	Also, concerning the Jews, write as you see fit, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s signet ring—for a decree which is written in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s signet ring may not be revoked.”
EST.8.9	So the king’s scribes were called at that time in the third month (that is, the month of Sivan) on the twenty-third day; and it was written in accordance with everything that Mordecai commanded, to the Jews, to the chief rulers (satraps), and the governors and officials of the provinces which 
EST.8.10	He wrote [a decree] in the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king’s ring, and sent letters by couriers on horseback, riding on the royal [mail] relay horses, the offspring of the racing mares. 
EST.8.11	In it the king granted the Jews who were in every city 
EST.8.12	on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, the thirteenth [day] of the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar). 
EST.8.13	A copy of the edict was to be issued as a law in every province and as a proclamation to all peoples, so that the Jews would be ready on that day, to avenge themselves on their enemies. 
EST.8.14	So the couriers, who were mounted on the royal relay horses, left quickly, urged on by the king’s command; and the decree was issued at the citadel in Susa [the capital].
EST.8.15	Then Mordecai departed from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, with a large crown of gold and with a robe of fine linen and purple wool; and the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced. 
EST.8.16	For [at this time] the Jews had light [a dawn of new hope] and gladness and joy and honor. 
EST.8.17	In each and every province and in each and every city, wherever the king’s command and his decree arrived, the Jews 
EST.9.1	Now in the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar) on the thirteenth day when the king’s command and edict were about to be executed, on the [very] day when the enemies of the Jews had hoped to gain power over them [and slaughter them], it happened the other way around so that the Jews themselves gained power over those who hated them. 
EST.9.2	The Jews assembled in their cities throughout the provinces of King Ahasuerus (Xerxes) to apprehend those who wanted to do them harm; and no one could stand before them, for the fear of them [and their God] had fallen on all the peoples. 
EST.9.3	Even all the officials of the provinces and the chief rulers (satraps) and the governors and those who attended to the king’s business supported the Jews [in defeating their enemies], because the fear of Mordecai [and his God’s power] had fallen on them. 
EST.9.4	For Mordecai was great 
EST.9.5	So the Jews struck all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them; and they did what they pleased to those who hated them. 
EST.9.6	At the citadel in Susa the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men, 
EST.9.7	and [they killed] Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 
EST.9.8	Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, 
EST.9.9	Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha, 
EST.9.10	the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews’ enemy; but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.
EST.9.11	On that day the number of those who were killed at the citadel in Susa was reported to the king. 
EST.9.12	The king said to Queen Esther, “The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman at the citadel in Susa. What then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now what is your petition? It shall be granted to you. What is your further request? It shall also be done.” 
EST.9.13	Esther replied, “If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Susa to act tomorrow also in accordance with the decree of today; and let [the dead bodies of] Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.” 
EST.9.14	So the king commanded it to be done; the decree was given in Susa, and they hanged [the bodies of] Haman’s ten sons. 
EST.9.15	The Jews who were in Susa also gathered together on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and killed three hundred men in Susa, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.
EST.9.16	Now the rest of the Jews who were in the king’s provinces assembled, to defend their lives and rid themselves of their enemies, and kill 75,000 of those who hated them; but they did not lay their hands on the plunder. 
EST.9.17	 on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth day they rested and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing.
EST.9.18	But the Jews who were in Susa assembled on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth of the same month, and on the fifteenth day they rested and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing. 
EST.9.19	Therefore the Jews of the villages, who live in the rural [unwalled] towns, make the fourteenth day of the month of Adar a holiday for rejoicing and feasting and sending choice portions 
EST.9.20	Now Mordecai recorded these events, and he sent letters to all the Jews who lived in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far, 
EST.9.21	obliging them to celebrate the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same month, annually, 
EST.9.22	because on those days the Jews rid themselves of their enemies, and as the month which was turned for them from grief to joy and from mourning into a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and rejoicing and sending choice portions 
EST.9.23	So the Jews undertook what they had started to do, and what Mordecai had written to them. 
EST.9.24	For Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, [to find the right time] to disturb and destroy them. 
EST.9.25	But when it came before the king, he commanded in writing that Haman’s wicked scheme which he had devised against the Jews was to return on his own head, and that he and his sons should [endure what he planned for the Jews and] be hanged on the gallows. 
EST.9.26	Therefore they called these days Purim after the name Pur (lot). And because of all the instructions in this letter, and what they had faced in this regard and what had happened to them, 
EST.9.27	the Jews established and made it a custom for themselves and for their descendants and for all who joined them, so that they would not fail to celebrate these two days as it was written and at the appointed time annually. 
EST.9.28	So these days were to be remembered and celebrated throughout every generation, every family, every province and every city; and these days of Purim were not to cease from among the Jews, nor their memory fade from their descendants.
EST.9.29	Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full power 
EST.9.30	He sent letters to all the Jews, to the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, in words of peace and truth, 
EST.9.31	to establish these days of Purim [to be observed] at their appointed times, just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established for them, and as they had established for themselves and for their descendants with instructions regarding their times of fasting and their lamentations (expressions of needing help). 
EST.9.32	The command of Esther established these customs for Purim, and it was written in the book [of the royal archives].
EST.10.1	King Ahasuerus (Xerxes) imposed a tax on the land and on the coastlands of the sea. 
EST.10.2	And all the accomplishments of his authority and strength, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king had raised him, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia? 
EST.10.3	For Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews and in favor with his many fellow people, for he worked for the good of his people and spoke for the welfare 
JOB.1.2	Seven sons and three daughters were born to him. 
JOB.1.3	He also possessed 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke (pairs) of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and a very great number of servants, so that this man was the greatest [and wealthiest and most respected] of all the men of the east (northern Arabia). 
JOB.1.4	His sons used to go [in turn] and feast in the house of each one on his 
JOB.1.5	When the days of their feasting were over, Job would send [for them] and consecrate them, rising early in the morning and offering burnt offerings 
JOB.1.6	Now there was a day when the sons of God (angels) came to present themselves before the 
JOB.1.7	The L
JOB.1.8	The L
JOB.1.9	Then Satan answered the L
JOB.1.10	Have You not put a hedge [of protection] around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands [and conferred prosperity and happiness upon him], and his possessions have increased in the land. 
JOB.1.11	But put forth Your hand now and touch (destroy) all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face.” 
JOB.1.12	Then the L
JOB.1.13	Now there was a day when Job’s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, 
JOB.1.14	and a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were feeding beside them, 
JOB.1.15	and the 
JOB.1.16	While he was still speaking, another [messenger] also came and said, “The fire of God (lightning) has fallen from the heavens and has burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.” 
JOB.1.17	While he was still speaking, another [messenger] also came and said, “The 
JOB.1.18	While he was still speaking, another [messenger] also came and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, 
JOB.1.19	and suddenly, a great wind came from across the desert, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people and they died, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
JOB.1.20	Then Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head [in mourning for the children], and he fell to the ground and worshiped [God]. 
JOB.1.21	He said,
JOB.1.21	“Naked (without possessions) I came [into this world] from my mother’s womb,
JOB.1.21	And naked I will return there.
JOB.1.21	The L
JOB.1.21	Blessed be the name of the L
JOB.1.22	Through all this Job did not sin nor did he blame God.
JOB.2.1	Again there was a day when the sons of God (angels) came to present themselves before the L
JOB.2.2	The L
JOB.2.3	The L
JOB.2.4	Satan answered the L
JOB.2.5	But put forth Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh [and severely afflict him]; and he will curse You to Your face.” 
JOB.2.6	So the L
JOB.2.7	So Satan departed from the presence of the L
JOB.2.8	And Job took a piece of broken pottery with which to scrape himself, and he sat [down] among the ashes (rubbish heaps).
JOB.2.9	Then his wife said to him, “Do you still cling to your integrity [and your faith and trust in God, without blaming Him]? Curse God and die!” 
JOB.2.10	But he said to her, “You speak as one of the [spiritually] foolish women speaks [ignorant and oblivious to God’s will]. Shall we indeed accept [only] good from God and not [also] accept adversity 
JOB.2.11	Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him, each one came from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; for they had made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and to comfort him. 
JOB.2.12	When they looked from a distance and did not recognize him [because of his disfigurement], they raised their voices and wept; and each one tore his robe [in grief] and they threw dust over their heads toward the sky [in sorrow]. 
JOB.2.13	So they sat down on the ground with Job for seven days and seven nights and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great.
JOB.3.1	After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his 
JOB.3.2	And Job said,
JOB.3.3	“Let the day on which I was born perish,
JOB.3.3	And the night which announced: ‘There is a man-child conceived.’
JOB.3.4	May that day be darkness;
JOB.3.4	Let God above not care about it,
JOB.3.4	Nor light shine on it.
JOB.3.5	Let darkness and gloom claim it for their own;
JOB.3.5	Let a cloud settle upon it;
JOB.3.5	Let all that blackens the day terrify it (the day that I was born).
JOB.3.6	As for that night, let darkness seize it;
JOB.3.6	Let it not rejoice among the days of the year;
JOB.3.6	Let it not be counted in the number of the months.
JOB.3.7	Behold, let that night be barren [and empty];
JOB.3.7	Let no joyful voice enter it.
JOB.3.8	Let those curse it 
JOB.3.8	Who are skilled in rousing up Leviathan.
JOB.3.9	Let the stars of its early dawn be dark;
JOB.3.9	Let 
JOB.3.9	Let it not see the eyelids of morning (the day’s dawning),
JOB.3.10	Because it did not shut the doors of my 
JOB.3.10	Nor hide trouble from my eyes.
JOB.3.11	“Why did I not die at birth,
JOB.3.11	Come forth from the womb and expire?
JOB.3.12	Why did the knees receive me?
JOB.3.12	And why the breasts, that I would nurse?
JOB.3.13	For now I would have lain down and been quiet;
JOB.3.13	I would have slept then, I would have been at rest [in death],
JOB.3.14	With kings and counselors of the earth,
JOB.3.14	Who built up [now desolate] ruins for themselves;
JOB.3.15	Or with princes who had gold,
JOB.3.15	Who filled their houses with silver.
JOB.3.16	Or like a miscarriage which is hidden 
JOB.3.16	Like infants who never saw light.
JOB.3.17	There [in death] the wicked cease from raging,
JOB.3.17	And there the weary are at rest.
JOB.3.18	There the prisoners rest together;
JOB.3.18	They do not hear the taskmaster’s voice.
JOB.3.19	The small and the great are there,
JOB.3.19	And the servant is free from his master.
JOB.3.20	“Why is the light given to him who is in misery,
JOB.3.20	And life to the bitter in soul,
JOB.3.21	Who wait for death, but it does not come,
JOB.3.21	And dig (search) for death more [diligently] than for hidden treasures,
JOB.3.22	Who rejoice exceedingly,
JOB.3.22	And rejoice when they find the grave?
JOB.3.23	And whom God has hedged in?
JOB.3.24	For my groaning comes at the sight of my food,
JOB.3.24	And my cries [of despair] are poured out like water.
JOB.3.25	For the thing which I greatly fear comes upon me,
JOB.3.25	And that of which I am afraid has come upon me.
JOB.3.26	I am not at ease, nor am I quiet,
JOB.3.26	And I am not at rest, and yet trouble still comes [upon me].”
JOB.4.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
JOB.4.2	“If we dare to converse with you, will you be impatient [or offended]?
JOB.4.2	But who can restrain himself from speaking?
JOB.4.3	Behold, you have admonished 
JOB.4.3	And you have strengthened weak hands.
JOB.4.4	Your words have helped the one who was stumbling to stand,
JOB.4.4	And you have strengthened feeble knees.
JOB.4.5	But now 
JOB.4.5	It touches you, and you are horrified.
JOB.4.6	Is not your fear 
JOB.4.6	And [is not] the integrity 
JOB.4.7	“Remember now, who, being innocent, ever perished?
JOB.4.7	Or where [and in what circumstances] were those upright 
JOB.4.8	As I have seen, those who plow wickedness
JOB.4.8	And those who sow trouble 
JOB.4.9	By the breath of God they perish,
JOB.4.9	And by the blast of His anger they are consumed.
JOB.4.10	The roaring of the lion and the voice of the 
JOB.4.10	And the teeth of the young lions are broken.
JOB.4.11	The lion perishes for lack of prey,
JOB.4.11	And the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
JOB.4.12	“Now a word was secretly brought to me,
JOB.4.12	And my ear received a whisper of it.
JOB.4.13	Amid disquieting thoughts from the visions of the night,
JOB.4.13	When deep sleep falls on men,
JOB.4.14	Dread and trembling came upon me,
JOB.4.14	Which made all my bones shake.
JOB.4.15	Then a spirit passed before my face;
JOB.4.15	The hair on my skin stood on end!
JOB.4.16	The spirit stood still, but I could not discern its appearance;
JOB.4.16	A form was before my eyes;
JOB.4.17	‘Can [mortal] man be just before God 
JOB.4.17	Can a man be pure before his Maker 
JOB.4.18	God puts no trust 
JOB.4.18	And He charges His angels with error.
JOB.4.19	How much more [will He blame and charge] those who dwell in houses (bodies) of clay,
JOB.4.19	Whose foundations are in the dust,
JOB.4.19	Who are crushed like a moth.
JOB.4.20	Between morning and evening they are broken in pieces 
JOB.4.20	Unobserved 
JOB.4.21	Is not their tent-cord drawn up within them [so that the tent collapses]?
JOB.4.21	Do they not die, and yet without [acquiring] wisdom?’
JOB.5.1	“Call now—is there anyone who will answer you?
JOB.5.1	And to which of the holy ones (angels) will you turn?
JOB.5.2	For anger slays the foolish man,
JOB.5.2	And jealousy kills the simple (naive).
JOB.5.3	I have seen the foolish taking root [and outwardly prospering],
JOB.5.3	But I cursed his dwelling immediately [for his destruction was certain].
JOB.5.4	His children are far from safety [and included in their father’s ruin],
JOB.5.4	They are oppressed 
JOB.5.4	And there is no 
JOB.5.5	The hungry devour his harvest
JOB.5.5	And take it even [when it grows] among the thorns;
JOB.5.5	The trap opens for [his] wealth.
JOB.5.6	For affliction does not come forth from the dust,
JOB.5.6	Nor does trouble spring forth from the ground.
JOB.5.7	For man is born for trouble,
JOB.5.7	[As naturally] as sparks fly upward.
JOB.5.8	“As for me, I would seek God 
JOB.5.8	And I would commit my cause to God;
JOB.5.9	Who does great and unsearchable things,
JOB.5.9	Marvelous things without number.
JOB.5.10	He gives rain upon the earth
JOB.5.10	And sends waters upon the fields,
JOB.5.11	So that He sets on high those who are lowly,
JOB.5.11	And He lifts to safety those who mourn.
JOB.5.12	He frustrates the devices 
JOB.5.12	So that their hands cannot attain success 
JOB.5.13	He catches the [so-called] wise in their own shrewdness,
JOB.5.13	And the advice of the devious is quickly thwarted.
JOB.5.14	In the daytime they meet in darkness,
JOB.5.14	And at noon they grope as in the night.
JOB.5.15	But God saves [the innocent] from the sword of the mouth of the devious,
JOB.5.15	And the poor from the hand of the mighty.
JOB.5.16	So the helpless have hope,
JOB.5.16	And injustice shuts its mouth.
JOB.5.17	“Behold, how happy 
JOB.5.17	So do not despise 
JOB.5.18	For He inflicts pain, but He binds up 
JOB.5.18	He wounds, but His hands also heal.
JOB.5.19	He will rescue you from six troubles;
JOB.5.19	Even in seven, evil will not touch you.
JOB.5.20	In famine He will redeem you from death,
JOB.5.20	And in war from the power of the sword.
JOB.5.21	You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,
JOB.5.21	And you will not be afraid of destruction when it comes.
JOB.5.22	You will laugh at violence and famine,
JOB.5.22	And you will not be afraid of the wild beasts of the earth.
JOB.5.23	For you will be in harmony with the stones of the field,
JOB.5.23	And the beasts of the field will be at peace with you.
JOB.5.24	You will know also that your tent is secure 
JOB.5.24	And you will visit your dwelling and fear no loss [nor find anything amiss].
JOB.5.25	You will know also that your descendants will be many,
JOB.5.25	And your offspring as the grass of the earth.
JOB.5.26	You will come to your grave in old age,
JOB.5.26	Like the stacking of grain [on the threshing floor] in its season.
JOB.5.27	Behold this; we have investigated it, 
JOB.5.27	Hear 
JOB.6.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.6.2	“Oh, that my grief could actually be weighed
JOB.6.2	And placed in the balances together with my tragedy [to see if my grief is the grief of a coward]!
JOB.6.3	For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea;
JOB.6.3	Therefore my words have been incoherent,
JOB.6.4	Because the arrows of the Almighty are within me,
JOB.6.4	My spirit drinks their poison;
JOB.6.4	The terrors of God are arrayed against me.
JOB.6.5	Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass?
JOB.6.5	Or does the ox low over his fodder?
JOB.6.6	Can something that has no taste to it be eaten without salt?
JOB.6.6	Or is there any flavor in the white of an egg?
JOB.6.7	My soul refuses to touch them;
JOB.6.7	Such things are like loathsome food to me [sickening and repugnant].
JOB.6.8	“Oh that my request would come to pass,
JOB.6.8	And that God would grant me the thing that I long for!
JOB.6.9	I wish that it would please God to crush me,
JOB.6.9	That He would let loose His hand and cut me off.
JOB.6.10	Then I would still have consolation,
JOB.6.10	And I would jump for joy amid unsparing pain,
JOB.6.10	That I have not denied 
JOB.6.11	What strength do I have left, that I should wait [and hope]?
JOB.6.11	And what is ahead of me, that I should be patient 
JOB.6.12	Is my strength 
JOB.6.12	Or is my flesh made of bronze?
JOB.6.13	Is it that I have no help within myself,
JOB.6.13	And that success 
JOB.6.14	“For the despairing man 
JOB.6.14	So that he does not 
JOB.6.15	My brothers have acted deceitfully like a brook,
JOB.6.15	Like the torrents of brooks that vanish,
JOB.6.16	Which are dull 
JOB.6.16	And into which the snow melts 
JOB.6.17	When it is warm, they are silent 
JOB.6.17	When it is hot, they vanish from their place.
JOB.6.18	The paths of their course wind along,
JOB.6.18	They go up into nothing 
JOB.6.18	[Your counsel is as helpful to me as a dry streambed in the heat of summer.]
JOB.6.19	The caravans of 
JOB.6.19	The caravans of 
JOB.6.20	They were put to shame 
JOB.6.20	They came there and were ashamed.
JOB.6.21	Indeed, you have now become like a dried-up stream,
JOB.6.21	You see a terror [believing me to be a victim of the wrath of God] and are afraid [to be compassionate].
JOB.6.22	Did I ever say, ‘Give me 
JOB.6.22	Or, ‘Pay a bribe for me from your wealth,’
JOB.6.23	Or, ‘Rescue me from the adversary’s hand,’
JOB.6.23	Or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of the tyrants’?
JOB.6.24	“Teach me, and I will be silent;
JOB.6.24	And show me how I have erred.
JOB.6.25	How painful are words of honesty.
JOB.6.25	But what does your argument prove?
JOB.6.26	Do you intend to reprove my words [with a convincing argument],
JOB.6.26	When the words of one in despair belong to the wind [and go ignored]?
JOB.6.27	You would cast 
JOB.6.27	And bargain away your friend.
JOB.6.28	Now please look at me,
JOB.6.28	And 
JOB.6.29	Turn away [from your suspicion], let there be no injustice;
JOB.6.29	Turn away, my righteousness 
JOB.6.30	Is there injustice 
JOB.6.30	Can my palate not discern what is destructive?
JOB.7.1	“Is not man forced to labor on earth?
JOB.7.1	And are not his days like the days of a hired man?
JOB.7.2	As a slave earnestly longs for the shade,
JOB.7.2	And as a hired man eagerly awaits his wages,
JOB.7.3	So am I allotted months of futility 
JOB.7.3	And [long] nights of trouble 
JOB.7.4	When I lie down I say,
JOB.7.4	‘When shall I arise [and the night be gone]?’
JOB.7.4	But the night continues,
JOB.7.4	And I am continually tossing until the dawning of day.
JOB.7.5	My body is clothed with worms and a crust of dust;
JOB.7.5	My skin is hardened [and broken and loathsome], and [breaks out and] runs.
JOB.7.6	My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle,
JOB.7.6	And are spent without hope.
JOB.7.7	“Remember that my life is but breath [a puff of wind, a sigh];
JOB.7.7	My eye will not see good again.
JOB.7.8	The eye of him who sees me [now] will see me no more;
JOB.7.8	Your eyes 
JOB.7.9	As a cloud vanishes and is gone,
JOB.7.9	So he who goes down to Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead) does not come up.
JOB.7.10	He will not return again to his house,
JOB.7.10	Nor will his place know about him anymore.
JOB.7.11	“Therefore I will not restrain my mouth;
JOB.7.11	I will speak in the anguish of my spirit,
JOB.7.11	I will complain in the bitterness of my soul [O Lord].
JOB.7.12	Am I the sea, or the sea monster,
JOB.7.12	That You set a guard over me?
JOB.7.13	When I say, ‘My bed will comfort me,
JOB.7.13	My couch will ease my complaint,’
JOB.7.14	Then You frighten me with dreams
JOB.7.14	And terrify me through visions,
JOB.7.15	So that I would choose suffocation,
JOB.7.15	Death rather than my 
JOB.7.16	I waste away 
JOB.7.16	Let me alone, for my days are but a breath [futile and without substance].
JOB.7.17	What is man that You [should] magnify him [and think him important]?
JOB.7.17	And that You are concerned about him?
JOB.7.18	And that You examine him every morning
JOB.7.18	And try 
JOB.7.19	Will You never turn Your gaze away from me [it plagues me],
JOB.7.19	Nor let me alone until I swallow my spittle?
JOB.7.20	If I have sinned, what [harm] have I done to You,
JOB.7.20	O Watcher of mankind?
JOB.7.20	Why have You set me as a target for You,
JOB.7.20	So that I am a burden to myself?
JOB.7.21	Why then do You not pardon my transgression
JOB.7.21	And take away my sin 
JOB.7.21	For now I will lie down in the dust;
JOB.7.21	And You will seek me [diligently], but I will not be.”
JOB.8.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,
JOB.8.2	“How long will you say these things?
JOB.8.2	And will the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?
JOB.8.3	Does God pervert justice?
JOB.8.3	Or does 
JOB.8.4	If your children have sinned against Him,
JOB.8.4	Then He has handed them over to the power of their transgression 
JOB.8.5	If you would [diligently] seek God
JOB.8.5	And implore the compassion 
JOB.8.6	Then, if you are pure and upright,
JOB.8.6	Surely now He will awaken for you
JOB.8.6	And restore your righteous place.
JOB.8.7	Though your beginning was insignificant,
JOB.8.7	Yet your end will greatly increase.
JOB.8.8	“Inquire, please, of past generations,
JOB.8.8	And consider 
JOB.8.9	For we are 
JOB.8.9	Because our days on earth are [like] a shadow [just a breath or a vapor].
JOB.8.10	Will they (the fathers) not teach you 
JOB.8.10	And utter words from their hearts [the deepest part of their nature]?
JOB.8.11	“Can the papyrus grow up without a marsh?
JOB.8.11	Can the rushes 
JOB.8.12	While it is still green (in flower) and not cut down,
JOB.8.12	Yet it withers before any 
JOB.8.13	So are the paths of all who forget God;
JOB.8.13	And the hope of the godless will perish,
JOB.8.14	For his confidence is fragile 
JOB.8.14	And his trust is [like] a spider’s web.
JOB.8.15	He trusts in his house, but it does not stand;
JOB.8.15	He holds tightly to it, but it does not endure.
JOB.8.16	He thrives 
JOB.8.16	And his branches spread out over his garden.
JOB.8.17	His [godless] roots are wrapped around a pile of rocks,
JOB.8.17	And he gazes at a house of stones.
JOB.8.18	If he is snatched from his place [in the garden],
JOB.8.18	Then his place will forget him, 
JOB.8.19	Behold, this is the joy of His way;
JOB.8.19	And from out of the dust others will spring up 
JOB.8.20	Behold, God will not reject a 
JOB.8.20	Nor will He strengthen 
JOB.8.21	He will yet fill your mouth with laughter
JOB.8.21	And your lips with joyful shouting [if you are found blameless].
JOB.8.22	Those who hate you will be clothed with shame,
JOB.8.22	And the tents of the wicked will be no longer.”
JOB.9.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.9.2	“Yes, I know it is true.
JOB.9.2	But how can a mortal man be right before God?
JOB.9.3	If one should want to contend 
JOB.9.3	He could not answer Him once in a thousand 
JOB.9.4	Who has [ever] defied 
JOB.9.5	When He overturns them in His anger;
JOB.9.6	Who shakes the earth out of its place,
JOB.9.6	And its pillars tremble;
JOB.9.7	Who commands the sun, and it does not shine;
JOB.9.7	Who seals up the stars [from view];
JOB.9.8	Who alone stretches out the heavens
JOB.9.8	And tramples down the 
JOB.9.9	Who made [the constellations] the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades,
JOB.9.9	And the [vast starry] spaces of the south;
JOB.9.10	Who does great things, [beyond understanding,] unfathomable,
JOB.9.10	Yes, marvelous 
JOB.9.11	Behold, He passes by me, and I do not see Him;
JOB.9.11	He moves past me, but I do not perceive Him.
JOB.9.12	Behold, He snatches away; who can restrain 
JOB.9.12	Who will say to Him, ‘What are You doing?’
JOB.9.13	“God will not turn back His anger;
JOB.9.13	The [proud] helpers of Rahab [the arrogant monster of the sea] bow under Him.
JOB.9.14	How can I answer Him [and plead my case],
JOB.9.14	Choosing my words [to reason] with Him?
JOB.9.15	For though I were righteous, I could not answer.
JOB.9.15	I must appeal for mercy to my Opponent 
JOB.9.16	If I called and He answered me,
JOB.9.16	I could not believe that He was listening to my voice.
JOB.9.17	For He bruises me with a tempest
JOB.9.17	And multiplies my wounds without cause.
JOB.9.18	He will not allow me to catch my breath,
JOB.9.18	But fills 
JOB.9.19	If it is a matter of strength 
JOB.9.19	And if of justice, who can summon 
JOB.9.20	Though I am innocent 
JOB.9.20	Though I am blameless, He would denounce me as guilty.
JOB.9.21	[Though] I am blameless,
JOB.9.21	I do not care about myself;
JOB.9.21	I despise my life.
JOB.9.22	It is 
JOB.9.22	‘He destroys [both] the blameless and the wicked.’
JOB.9.23	When [His] scourge kills suddenly,
JOB.9.23	He mocks at the despair of the innocent.
JOB.9.24	The earth is given into the hands of the wicked;
JOB.9.24	He covers the faces of its judges [so that they are blind to justice].
JOB.9.24	If it is not He, then who is it [that is responsible for all this injustice]?
JOB.9.25	“Now my days are swifter than a runner;
JOB.9.25	They vanish, they see no good.
JOB.9.26	They pass by like the [swift] boats made of reeds,
JOB.9.26	Like an eagle that swoops down on its prey.
JOB.9.27	If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint,
JOB.9.27	I will leave off my sad appearance, and be cheerful 
JOB.9.28	I am afraid of all my pains 
JOB.9.28	I know that You will not acquit me 
JOB.9.29	I am accounted wicked 
JOB.9.29	Why then should I labor in vain [to appear innocent]?
JOB.9.30	If I were to wash myself with snow
JOB.9.30	And cleanse my hands with lye,
JOB.9.31	You would still plunge me into the pit,
JOB.9.31	And my own clothes would hate me [and refuse to cover my foul body].
JOB.9.32	For God is not a [mere] man, as I am, that I may answer Him,
JOB.9.32	That we may go to court 
JOB.9.33	There is no arbitrator between us,
JOB.9.33	Who could lay his hand upon us both [would that there were].
JOB.9.34	Let Him take His rod away from me,
JOB.9.34	And let not the dread 
JOB.9.35	But I am not like that in myself.
JOB.10.1	“I am disgusted with my life 
JOB.10.1	I will give free expression to my complaint;
JOB.10.1	I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
JOB.10.2	I will say to God, ‘Do not condemn me [and declare me guilty]!
JOB.10.2	Show me why You contend 
JOB.10.3	Does it indeed seem right to You to oppress,
JOB.10.3	To despise 
JOB.10.3	And to look with favor on the schemes of the wicked?
JOB.10.4	Do You have eyes of flesh?
JOB.10.4	Do You see as a man sees?
JOB.10.5	Are Your days as the days of a mortal,
JOB.10.5	Are Your years as man’s years,
JOB.10.6	That You seek my guilt
JOB.10.6	And search for my sin?
JOB.10.7	Although You know that I am not guilty 
JOB.10.7	Yet there is no one who can rescue me from Your hand.
JOB.10.8	‘Your hands have formed and made me altogether.
JOB.10.8	Would You [turn around and] destroy me?
JOB.10.9	Remember now, that You have made me as clay;
JOB.10.9	So will You turn me into dust again?
JOB.10.10	Have You not poured me out like milk
JOB.10.10	And curdled me like cheese?
JOB.10.11	[You have] clothed me with skin and flesh,
JOB.10.11	And knit me together with bones and sinews.
JOB.10.12	You have granted me life and lovingkindness;
JOB.10.12	And Your providence (divine care, supervision) has preserved my spirit.
JOB.10.13	Yet these [present evils] You have hidden in Your heart [since my creation]:
JOB.10.13	I know that this was within You [in Your purpose and thought].
JOB.10.14	If I sin, then You would take note 
JOB.10.14	And You would not acquit me of my guilt.
JOB.10.15	If I am wicked, woe to me [for judgment comes]!
JOB.10.15	And if I am righteous, I dare not lift up my head.
JOB.10.15	For I am sated 
JOB.10.16	Should I lift my head up, You would hunt me like a lion;
JOB.10.16	And again You would show Your marvelous power against me.
JOB.10.17	You renew Your witnesses against me
JOB.10.17	And increase Your indignation 
JOB.10.17	Hardship after hardship is with me [attacking me time after time].
JOB.10.18	‘Why then did You bring me out of the womb?
JOB.10.18	Would that I had perished and no eye had seen me!
JOB.10.19	I should have been as though I had not existed;
JOB.10.19	[I should have been] carried from the womb to the grave.’
JOB.10.20	Would He not let my few days alone,
JOB.10.20	Withdraw from me that I may have a little cheer
JOB.10.21	Before I go—and I shall not return—
JOB.10.21	To the land of darkness and the deep shadow [of death],
JOB.10.22	The [sunless] land of utter gloom as darkness 
JOB.10.22	[The land] of the shadow of death, without order,
JOB.10.22	And [where] it shines as [thick] darkness.”
JOB.11.1	Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said,
JOB.11.2	“Shall a multitude of words not be answered?
JOB.11.2	And should a talkative man [making such a long-winded defense] be acquitted?
JOB.11.3	Should your boasts 
JOB.11.3	And shall you scoff and no one put you to shame?
JOB.11.4	For you have said, ‘My teaching (doctrine) [that God knowingly afflicts the righteous] is pure,
JOB.11.4	And I am innocent in your eyes.’
JOB.11.5	But oh, that God would speak,
JOB.11.5	And open His lips [to speak] against you,
JOB.11.6	And [that He would] show you the secrets of wisdom!
JOB.11.6	For sound wisdom 
JOB.11.6	Know therefore that God forgets a part of your wickedness 
JOB.11.7	“Can you discover the depths of God?
JOB.11.7	Can you [by searching] discover the limits of the Almighty [ascend to His heights, extend to His widths, and comprehend His infinite perfection]?
JOB.11.8	It is deeper than Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead). What can you know?
JOB.11.9	It is longer in measure [and scope] than the earth,
JOB.11.9	And broader than the sea.
JOB.11.10	If God passes by or arrests,
JOB.11.10	Or calls an assembly [of judgment], who can restrain Him?
JOB.11.10	[If He is against a man, who can call Him to account for it?]
JOB.11.11	For He recognizes 
JOB.11.11	And He sees wickedness, will He not consider it?
JOB.11.12	But a hollow (empty-headed) man will become intelligent 
JOB.11.12	[Only] when the 
JOB.11.13	“If you direct your heart [on the right path]
JOB.11.13	And stretch out your hands to Him,
JOB.11.14	If sin is in your hand, put it far away [from you],
JOB.11.14	And do not let wrongdoing dwell in your tents;
JOB.11.15	Then, indeed, you could lift up your face [to Him] without 
JOB.11.15	And you would be firmly established 
JOB.11.16	For you would forget your trouble;
JOB.11.16	You would remember it as waters that have passed by.
JOB.11.17	And your 
JOB.11.17	Darkness [then] would be like the morning.
JOB.11.18	Then you would trust [with confidence], because there is hope;
JOB.11.18	You would look around you and rest securely.
JOB.11.19	You would lie down with no one to frighten you,
JOB.11.19	And many would entreat 
JOB.11.20	But the eyes of the wicked will fail,
JOB.11.20	And they will not escape [the justice of God];
JOB.11.20	And their hope is to breathe their last [and die].”
JOB.12.1	Then Job responded,
JOB.12.2	“No doubt you are the [only wise] people [in the world],
JOB.12.2	And wisdom will die with you!
JOB.12.3	But I have intelligence 
JOB.12.3	I am not inferior to you.
JOB.12.3	Who does not know such things as these [of God’s wisdom and might]?
JOB.12.4	I am a joke to my friends;
JOB.12.4	I, one whom God answered when he called upon Him—
JOB.12.4	A just and blameless man is a joke [and laughed to scorn].
JOB.12.5	He who is at ease has contempt for misfortune,
JOB.12.6	The tents of the destroyers prosper;
JOB.12.6	And those who provoke God are [apparently] secure,
JOB.12.6	Whom God brings into their power.
JOB.12.7	“Now ask the animals, and let them teach you [that God does not deal with His creatures according to their character];
JOB.12.7	And ask the birds of the air, and let them tell you;
JOB.12.8	Or speak to the earth [with its many forms of life], and it will teach you;
JOB.12.8	And let the fish of the sea declare [this truth] to you.
JOB.12.9	Who among all these does not recognize [in all these things that good and evil are randomly scattered throughout nature and human life]
JOB.12.9	That the hand of the L
JOB.12.10	In whose hand is the life of every living thing,
JOB.12.10	And the breath of all mankind?
JOB.12.11	Does the ear not put words to the test,
JOB.12.11	Just as the palate tastes its food [distinguishing between the desirable and the undesirable]?
JOB.12.12	With the aged [you say] is wisdom,
JOB.12.12	And 
JOB.12.13	“But [only] with Him are [perfect] wisdom and might;
JOB.12.13	He [alone] has [true] counsel and understanding.
JOB.12.14	Behold, He tears down, and it cannot be rebuilt;
JOB.12.14	He imprisons a man, and there can be no release.
JOB.12.15	Behold, He restrains the waters, and they dry up;
JOB.12.15	Again, He sends the waters out, and they overwhelm 
JOB.12.16	With Him are might and sound wisdom,
JOB.12.16	The misled and the misleader are His [and in His power].
JOB.12.17	He makes [great and scheming] counselors walk barefoot
JOB.12.17	And makes fools of judges.
JOB.12.18	He loosens the bond of kings
JOB.12.18	And binds their loins with a loincloth.
JOB.12.19	He makes priests walk barefoot,
JOB.12.19	And He overturns men firmly seated 
JOB.12.20	He deprives the trusted ones of speech
JOB.12.20	And takes away the discernment 
JOB.12.21	He pours contempt on princes 
JOB.12.21	And loosens the belt of the strong [disabling them].
JOB.12.22	He uncovers mysteries [that are difficult to grasp and understand] out of the darkness
JOB.12.22	And brings black gloom 
JOB.12.23	He makes nations great, and He destroys them;
JOB.12.23	He enlarges nations, and leads them away [captive].
JOB.12.24	He removes intelligence 
JOB.12.24	And makes them wander 
JOB.12.25	They grope in darkness without light,
JOB.12.25	And He makes them stagger like a drunken man.”
JOB.13.1	[Job continued:] “Behold, my eye has seen all 
JOB.13.1	My ear has heard and understood it.
JOB.13.2	What you know I also know;
JOB.13.2	I am not inferior to you.
JOB.13.3	“But I wish to speak to 
JOB.13.3	And I desire to argue with God.
JOB.13.4	But you smear me with lies [you defame my character most untruthfully];
JOB.13.4	You are all worthless physicians 
JOB.13.5	Oh, that you would be completely silent,
JOB.13.5	And that 
JOB.13.6	Please hear my argument
JOB.13.6	And listen to the pleadings of my lips.
JOB.13.7	Will you speak what is unjust for God,
JOB.13.7	And speak what is deceitful for Him?
JOB.13.8	Will you show partiality for Him [and be unjust to me so that you may gain favor with Him]?
JOB.13.8	Will you contend 
JOB.13.9	Will it be well for you when He investigates you [and your tactics against me]?
JOB.13.9	Or will you deceive Him as one deceives a man?
JOB.13.10	He will surely reprimand you
JOB.13.10	If you secretly show partiality.
JOB.13.11	Will not His majesty terrify you,
JOB.13.11	And will not the dread of Him fall upon you?
JOB.13.12	Your memorable sayings are [worthless, merely] proverbs of ashes;
JOB.13.12	Your defenses are defenses of [crumbling] clay.
JOB.13.13	“Be silent before me so that I may speak;
JOB.13.13	And let happen to me what may.
JOB.13.14	Why should I take my flesh in my teeth
JOB.13.14	And put my life in my hands [incurring the wrath of God]?
JOB.13.15	Even though He kills me;
JOB.13.15	I will hope in Him.
JOB.13.15	Nevertheless, I will argue my ways to His face.
JOB.13.16	This also will be my salvation,
JOB.13.16	For a godless man may not come before Him.
JOB.13.17	Listen diligently to my speech,
JOB.13.17	And let my declaration fill your ears.
JOB.13.18	Behold now, I have prepared my case;
JOB.13.18	I know that I will be vindicated.
JOB.13.19	Who will argue 
JOB.13.19	For then I would be silent and die.
JOB.13.20	“Only [O Lord,] do not do two things to me,
JOB.13.20	And then I will not hide myself from Your face:
JOB.13.21	Withdraw Your hand from me 
JOB.13.21	And let not the dread of You terrify me.
JOB.13.22	Then [Lord,] call, and I will answer;
JOB.13.22	Or let me speak, and then reply to me.
JOB.13.23	How many are my iniquities and sins [that so much sorrow should come to me]?
JOB.13.23	Make me recognize 
JOB.13.24	Why do You hide Your face [as if offended]
JOB.13.24	And consider me Your enemy?
JOB.13.25	Will You cause a windblown leaf to tremble?
JOB.13.25	Will You pursue the chaff of the dry stubble?
JOB.13.26	For You write bitter things against me [in Your indictment]
JOB.13.26	And make me inherit 
JOB.13.27	You also put my feet in the stocks [as punishment]
JOB.13.27	And [critically] observe all my paths;
JOB.13.27	You set a circle 
JOB.13.28	While I waste away like a rotten thing,
JOB.13.28	Like a garment that is moth-eaten.
JOB.14.1	“Man, who is born of a woman,
JOB.14.1	Is short-lived and full of turmoil.
JOB.14.2	Like a flower he comes forth and withers;
JOB.14.2	He also flees like a shadow and does not remain.
JOB.14.3	You also open Your eyes upon him
JOB.14.3	And bring him into judgment with Yourself.
JOB.14.4	Who can make a clean thing out of the unclean?
JOB.14.4	No one!
JOB.14.5	Since his days are determined,
JOB.14.5	The number of his months is with You [in Your control],
JOB.14.5	And You have made his limits so he cannot pass [his allotted time].
JOB.14.6	[O God] turn your gaze from him so that he may rest,
JOB.14.6	Until he fulfills his day [on earth] like a hired man.
JOB.14.7	“For there is hope for a tree,
JOB.14.7	If it is cut down, that it will sprout again,
JOB.14.7	And that the shoots of it will not cease 
JOB.14.8	Though its roots grow old in the earth
JOB.14.8	And its stump dies in the dry soil,
JOB.14.9	Yet at the scent of water [the stump of the tree] will flourish
JOB.14.9	And bring forth sprigs 
JOB.14.10	But [the brave, strong] man must die and lie face down;
JOB.14.10	Man breathes his last, and where is he?
JOB.14.11	As water evaporates from the sea,
JOB.14.11	And a river drains and dries up,
JOB.14.12	So man lies down and does not rise [again].
JOB.14.12	Until the heavens are no longer,
JOB.14.13	“Oh, that You would hide me in Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead),
JOB.14.13	That You would conceal me until Your wrath is past,
JOB.14.13	That You would set a definite time and then remember me [and in Your lovingkindness imprint me on your heart]!
JOB.14.14	If a man dies, will he live again?
JOB.14.14	I will wait all the days of my struggle
JOB.14.14	Until my change 
JOB.14.15	[Then] You will call, and I will answer You;
JOB.14.15	You will long for [me] the work of Your hands.
JOB.14.16	But now You number [each of] my steps;
JOB.14.16	You do not observe 
JOB.14.17	My transgression is sealed up in a bag,
JOB.14.17	And You cover my wickedness [from Your view].
JOB.14.18	“But as a mountain, if it falls, crumbles into nothing,
JOB.14.18	And as the rock is moved from its place,
JOB.14.19	Water wears away the stones,
JOB.14.19	Its floods 
JOB.14.19	So You [O Lord] destroy the hope of man.
JOB.14.20	You prevail forever against him 
JOB.14.20	You change his appearance and send him away [from the presence of the living].
JOB.14.21	His sons achieve honor, and he does not know it;
JOB.14.21	They become insignificant, and he is not aware of it.
JOB.14.22	But his body [lamenting its decay] grieves in pain over it,
JOB.14.22	And his soul mourns over [the loss of] himself.”
JOB.15.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered [Job] and said,
JOB.15.2	“Should a wise man [such as you] utter such windy 
JOB.15.2	And fill himself with the east wind [of withering, parching, and violent accusations]?
JOB.15.3	Should he rebuke 
JOB.15.3	Or with words in which there is no benefit?
JOB.15.4	Indeed, you are doing away with fear,
JOB.15.4	And you are diminishing meditation before God.
JOB.15.5	For your guilt teaches your mouth,
JOB.15.5	And you choose [to speak] the language of the crafty 
JOB.15.6	Your own mouth condemns you, and not I;
JOB.15.6	Yes, your own lips testify against you.
JOB.15.7	“Were you the first man to be born [the original wise man],
JOB.15.7	Or were you created before the hills?
JOB.15.8	Do you hear the secret counsel of God,
JOB.15.8	And do you limit [the possession of] wisdom to yourself?
JOB.15.9	What do you know that we do not know?
JOB.15.10	Among us are both the gray-haired and the aged,
JOB.15.10	Older than your father.
JOB.15.11	Are the consolations of God [as we have interpreted them to you] too trivial for you,
JOB.15.11	[Or] were we too gentle toward you [in our first speech] to be effective?
JOB.15.12	Why does your heart carry you away [allowing you to be controlled by emotion]?
JOB.15.12	And why do your eyes flash [in anger or contempt],
JOB.15.13	That you should turn your spirit against God
JOB.15.13	And let 
JOB.15.14	What is man, that he should be pure 
JOB.15.14	Or he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous 
JOB.15.15	Behold, God puts no trust in His holy ones (angels);
JOB.15.15	Indeed, the heavens are not pure in His sight—
JOB.15.16	How much less [pure and clean is] the one who is repulsive and corrupt,
JOB.15.16	Man, who drinks unrighteousness 
JOB.15.17	“I will tell you, listen to me;
JOB.15.17	And what I have seen I will also declare;
JOB.15.18	What wise men have [freely] told,
JOB.15.18	And have not hidden [anything passed on to them] from their fathers,
JOB.15.19	To whom alone the land was given,
JOB.15.19	And no stranger passed among them [corrupting the truth].
JOB.15.20	The wicked man writhes with pain all his days,
JOB.15.20	And numbered are the years stored up for him, the ruthless one.
JOB.15.21	A [dreadful] sound of terrors is in his ears;
JOB.15.21	While at peace 
JOB.15.22	He does not believe that he will return out of the darkness [for fear of being murdered],
JOB.15.22	And he is destined for the sword [of God’s vengeance].
JOB.15.23	He wanders about for food, saying, ‘Where is it?’
JOB.15.23	He knows that the day of darkness 
JOB.15.24	Distress and anxiety terrify him,
JOB.15.24	They overpower him like a king ready for battle.
JOB.15.25	Because he has stretched out his hand against God
JOB.15.25	And behaves arrogantly against 
JOB.15.26	Running 
JOB.15.26	With his ornamented 
JOB.15.27	For he has covered his face with his fat,
JOB.15.27	Adding layers of fat to his thighs [giving himself up to pleasures],
JOB.15.28	And he has lived in desolate [God-forsaken] cities,
JOB.15.28	In houses which no one should inhabit,
JOB.15.28	Which were destined to become heaps [of ruins];
JOB.15.29	He will not become rich, nor will his wealth endure;
JOB.15.29	And his grain will not bend to the earth 
JOB.15.30	He will not escape from darkness [fleeing disaster];
JOB.15.30	The flame [of God’s wrath] will wither his branch,
JOB.15.30	And by the blast of His mouth he will go away.
JOB.15.31	Let him not trust in vanity (emptiness, futility) and be led astray;
JOB.15.31	For emptiness will be his 
JOB.15.32	It will be fulfilled while he still lives,
JOB.15.32	And his branch will not be green [but shall wither away].
JOB.15.33	He will fail to bring his grapes to maturity [leaving them to wither unnourished] on the vine,
JOB.15.33	And will cast off blossoms [and fail to bring forth fruit] like the olive tree.
JOB.15.34	For the company of the godless is barren,
JOB.15.34	And fire consumes the tents of bribery (wrong and injustice).
JOB.15.35	They conceive mischief and bring forth wickedness,
JOB.15.35	And their inmost soul prepares deceit 
JOB.16.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.16.2	“I have heard many such things;
JOB.16.2	Wearisome 
JOB.16.3	Is there no end to [your futile] words of wind?
JOB.16.3	Or what plagues you [so much] that you [so boldly] answer [me like this]?
JOB.16.4	I also could speak like you,
JOB.16.4	If you were in my place;
JOB.16.4	I could compose 
JOB.16.4	And shake my head at you.
JOB.16.5	[But instead] I could strengthen 
JOB.16.5	And the consolation 
JOB.16.6	“If I speak [to you miserable comforters], my pain is not relieved;
JOB.16.6	And if I refrain [from speaking], what [pain or anguish] leaves me?
JOB.16.7	But now God has exhausted me.
JOB.16.7	You [O Lord] have destroyed all my family 
JOB.16.8	You have taken a firm hold on me 
JOB.16.8	It has become a witness [against me];
JOB.16.8	And my leanness [and infirmity] rises up [as evidence] against me,
JOB.16.8	It testifies to my face [about my guilt].
JOB.16.9	His wrath has torn me and hunted me down,
JOB.16.9	He has gnashed at me with his teeth;
JOB.16.9	My adversary sharpens His gaze 
JOB.16.10	They have gaped at me with their mouths,
JOB.16.10	With contempt they have struck me on the cheek;
JOB.16.10	They massed themselves together [and conspired] against me.
JOB.16.11	God hands me over to 
JOB.16.11	And tosses me [headlong] into the hands of the wicked.
JOB.16.12	I was [living] at ease, but He crushed me 
JOB.16.12	And He has seized me by the neck and has shaken me to pieces;
JOB.16.12	He has also set me up as His target.
JOB.16.13	His arrows surround me.
JOB.16.13	He pierces my kidneys (vital organs) without mercy;
JOB.16.13	He pours out my gall on the ground.
JOB.16.14	He attacks me, making wound after wound;
JOB.16.14	He runs at me like a warrior.
JOB.16.15	I have sewed sackcloth over my skin [as a sign of mourning]
JOB.16.15	And have defiled my horn (symbol of strength) in the dust.
JOB.16.16	My face is red 
JOB.16.16	And on my eyelids is the shadow of death [my eyes are dimmed],
JOB.16.17	Although there is no violence 
JOB.16.17	And my prayer is pure.
JOB.16.18	“O earth, do not cover my blood,
JOB.16.18	And let there be no [resting] place for my cry [where it will cease being heard].
JOB.16.19	Even now, behold, my Witness is in heaven,
JOB.16.19	And my Advocate [who vouches and testifies for me] is on high.
JOB.16.20	My friends are scoffers [who ridicule];
JOB.16.20	My eye pours out tears to God.
JOB.16.21	Oh, that a man would mediate 
JOB.16.21	Just as a man [mediates and pleads] with his neighbor 
JOB.16.22	For when a few years are past,
JOB.16.22	I shall go the way of no return.
JOB.17.1	“My spirit is broken, my days are extinguished,
JOB.17.1	The grave is 
JOB.17.2	Surely there are mockers 
JOB.17.2	And my eye gazes on their obstinacy 
JOB.17.3	“Give me a pledge (guarantee, promise) with Yourself [acknowledge my innocence before my death];
JOB.17.3	Who is there that will 
JOB.17.4	But You [Lord] have closed their hearts to understanding,
JOB.17.4	Therefore You will not exalt them [by giving a verdict against me].
JOB.17.5	He who denounces 
JOB.17.5	The eyes of his children will also languish 
JOB.17.6	“But He has made me a byword 
JOB.17.6	And I have become one in whose face people spit.
JOB.17.7	My eye has grown dim (unexpressive) because of grief,
JOB.17.7	And all my [body’s] members are [wasted away] like a shadow.
JOB.17.8	The upright will be [astonished and] appalled at this,
JOB.17.8	And the innocent will stir himself up against the godless 
JOB.17.9	Nevertheless the righteous will hold to his ways,
JOB.17.9	And he who has clean hands will grow stronger and stronger.
JOB.17.10	But as for all of you, come back again,
JOB.17.10	Even though I do not find a wise man among you.
JOB.17.11	My days are past, my purposes 
JOB.17.11	The wishes of my heart [are broken].
JOB.17.12	These [thoughts try to] make the night into the day;
JOB.17.12	‘The light is near,’ 
JOB.17.13	But if I look to Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead) as my home,
JOB.17.13	If I make my bed in the darkness,
JOB.17.14	If I call out to the pit (grave), ‘You are my father’;
JOB.17.14	And to the worm [that feeds on decay], ‘You are my mother and my sister [because I will soon be closest to you],’
JOB.17.15	Where now is my hope?
JOB.17.15	And who regards 
JOB.17.16	Will my hope go down with me to Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead)?
JOB.17.16	Shall we go down together in the dust?”
JOB.18.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,
JOB.18.2	“How long will you hunt for words 
JOB.18.2	Do some clear thinking 
JOB.18.3	Why are we regarded as beasts,
JOB.18.3	As if [we are] stupid (senseless) in your eyes?
JOB.18.4	You who tear yourself apart in anger,
JOB.18.4	Is the earth to be abandoned for your sake,
JOB.18.4	Or the rock to be moved out of its place?
JOB.18.5	“Indeed, the light of the wicked will be put out,
JOB.18.5	And the flame of his fire will not shine.
JOB.18.6	The light will be dark in his tent,
JOB.18.6	And his lamp beside him will be put out.
JOB.18.7	The vigorous stride will be shortened,
JOB.18.7	And his own counsel 
JOB.18.8	For the wicked is thrown into a net by his own feet (wickedness),
JOB.18.8	And he steps on the webbing [of the lattice-covered pit].
JOB.18.9	A snare catches him by the heel,
JOB.18.9	And a trap snaps shut on him.
JOB.18.10	A noose is hidden for him on the ground,
JOB.18.10	And a trap for him on the path.
JOB.18.11	Terrors frighten him on every side
JOB.18.11	And chase at his heels.
JOB.18.12	The strength [of the wicked] is famished 
JOB.18.12	And disaster is ready at his side [if he stops].
JOB.18.13	His skin is devoured by disease;
JOB.18.13	The firstborn of death [the worst of diseases] consumes his limbs.
JOB.18.14	He is torn from his tent which he trusted [for safety],
JOB.18.14	And he is marched 
JOB.18.15	Nothing of his dwells in his tent;
JOB.18.15	Brimstone (burning sulfur) is scattered over his dwelling [to purify it].
JOB.18.16	The roots [of the wicked] are dried up below,
JOB.18.16	And above, his branch is cut off 
JOB.18.17	Memory of him perishes from the earth,
JOB.18.17	And he has no name on the street.
JOB.18.18	He is driven 
JOB.18.18	And chased from the inhabited world.
JOB.18.19	He has no offspring or prosperity among his people,
JOB.18.19	Nor any survivor where he sojourned.
JOB.18.20	Those in the west are astonished 
JOB.18.20	And those in the east are seized with horror.
JOB.18.21	Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked 
JOB.18.21	And such is the place of him who does not know 
JOB.19.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.19.2	“How long will you torment 
JOB.19.2	And crush me with words?
JOB.19.3	These ten times you have insulted me;
JOB.19.3	You are not ashamed to wrong me [and harden your hearts against me].
JOB.19.4	And if it were true that I have erred,
JOB.19.4	My error would remain with me [and I would be conscious of it].
JOB.19.5	If indeed you [braggarts] vaunt 
JOB.19.5	And prove my disgrace (humiliation) to me,
JOB.19.6	Know then that God has wronged me 
JOB.19.6	And has closed His net around me.
JOB.19.7	“Behold, I cry out, ‘Violence!’ but I am not heard;
JOB.19.7	I shout for help, but there is no justice.
JOB.19.8	He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass,
JOB.19.8	And He has set darkness upon my paths.
JOB.19.9	He has stripped me of my honor
JOB.19.9	And removed the crown from my head.
JOB.19.10	He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone;
JOB.19.10	He has uprooted my hope like a tree.
JOB.19.11	He has also kindled His wrath [like a fire] against me
JOB.19.11	And He considers 
JOB.19.12	His troops come together
JOB.19.12	And build up their way 
JOB.19.12	And camp around my tent.
JOB.19.13	“He has put my brothers far from me,
JOB.19.13	And my acquaintances are completely estranged from me.
JOB.19.14	My relatives have failed [me],
JOB.19.14	And my intimate friends have forgotten me.
JOB.19.15	Those who live [temporarily] in my house and my maids consider me a stranger;
JOB.19.15	I am a foreigner in their sight.
JOB.19.16	I call to my servant, but he does not answer;
JOB.19.16	I have to implore him with words.
JOB.19.17	My breath is repulsive to my wife,
JOB.19.17	And I am loathsome to my own brothers.
JOB.19.18	Even young children despise me;
JOB.19.18	When I get up, they speak against me.
JOB.19.19	All the men of my council hate me;
JOB.19.19	Those I love have turned against me.
JOB.19.20	My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh,
JOB.19.20	And I have escaped [death] by the skin of my teeth.
JOB.19.21	Have pity on me! Have pity on me, O you my friends,
JOB.19.21	For the hand of God has touched me.
JOB.19.22	Why do you persecute me as God 
JOB.19.22	Why are you not satisfied with my flesh (anguish)?
JOB.19.23	“Oh, that the words I now speak were written!
JOB.19.23	Oh, that they were recorded in a scroll!
JOB.19.24	That with an iron stylus and [molten] lead
JOB.19.24	They were engraved in the rock forever!
JOB.19.25	For I know that my Redeemer 
JOB.19.25	And at the last He will take His stand upon the earth.
JOB.19.26	Even after my [mortal] skin is destroyed [by death],
JOB.19.26	Yet from my [immortal] flesh I will see God,
JOB.19.27	Whom I, even I, will see for myself,
JOB.19.27	And my eyes will see Him and not another!
JOB.19.27	My heart faints within me.
JOB.19.28	If you say, ‘How shall we [continue to] persecute him?’
JOB.19.28	And ‘What pretext for a case against him can we find [since we claim the root of these afflictions is found in him]?’
JOB.19.29	For wrathful are the punishments of that sword,
JOB.19.29	So that you may know there is judgment.”
JOB.20.1	Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said,
JOB.20.2	“Therefore my disquieting thoughts make me answer,
JOB.20.2	Because of the uneasiness that is within me.
JOB.20.3	I have heard the reproof which insults me,
JOB.20.3	But the spirit of my understanding makes me answer.
JOB.20.4	Do you not know this from the old days,
JOB.20.4	Since the time that man was placed on the earth,
JOB.20.5	That the triumphing of the wicked is short,
JOB.20.5	And the joy of the godless is only for a moment?
JOB.20.6	Though his pride reaches the heavens
JOB.20.6	And his head touches the clouds,
JOB.20.7	Those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’
JOB.20.8	He flies away like a dream and cannot be found;
JOB.20.8	Yes, he is chased away like a vision of the night.
JOB.20.9	The eye which saw him sees him no longer,
JOB.20.9	Neither does his [accustomed] place behold him any longer.
JOB.20.10	His sons favor the poor [and pay his obligations],
JOB.20.10	And his hands give back his [ill-gotten] wealth.
JOB.20.11	His bones are full of youthful strength
JOB.20.11	But it lies down with him in the dust.
JOB.20.12	“Though evil 
JOB.20.12	And he hides it under his tongue,
JOB.20.13	Though he desires it and will not let it go
JOB.20.13	But holds it in his mouth,
JOB.20.14	It is the venom of vipers within him.
JOB.20.15	He swallows [his ill-gotten] riches,
JOB.20.15	But will vomit them up;
JOB.20.15	God will drive them out of his belly.
JOB.20.16	He sucks the poison of vipers [which ill-gotten wealth contains];
JOB.20.16	The viper’s tongue slays him.
JOB.20.17	He does not look at the rivers,
JOB.20.17	The flowing streams of honey and butter [to enjoy his wealth].
JOB.20.18	He gives back what he has labored for 
JOB.20.18	And cannot swallow it [down to enjoy it];
JOB.20.18	As to the riches of his labor,
JOB.20.18	He cannot even enjoy them.
JOB.20.19	For he has oppressed and neglected the poor;
JOB.20.19	He has violently taken away houses which he did not build.
JOB.20.20	“Because he knew no quietness 
JOB.20.20	He does not retain anything he desires.
JOB.20.21	There is nothing left of what he devoured;
JOB.20.21	Therefore his prosperity does not endure.
JOB.20.22	In the fullness of his excess (great abundance) he will be in trouble;
JOB.20.22	The hand of everyone who suffers will come against him [he is miserable on every side].
JOB.20.23	When he fills his belly,
JOB.20.23	And will rain it upon him while he is eating.
JOB.20.24	He may flee from the iron weapon,
JOB.20.25	Yes, the glittering point comes out of his gall.
JOB.20.25	Terrors march in upon him;
JOB.20.26	Complete darkness (misfortune) is held in reserve for his treasures.
JOB.20.26	An unfanned fire will devour him;
JOB.20.26	It will consume the survivor in his tent.
JOB.20.27	The heavens will reveal his wickedness 
JOB.20.27	And the earth will rise up against him.
JOB.20.28	The produce 
JOB.20.29	This is the wicked man’s portion from God,
JOB.20.29	And the heritage decreed 
JOB.21.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.21.2	“Listen carefully to my speech,
JOB.21.2	And let this be the consolation.
JOB.21.3	Bear with me, and I also will speak;
JOB.21.3	And after I have spoken, you may [continue to] mock [me].
JOB.21.4	As for me, is my complaint to man 
JOB.21.4	And why should I not be impatient 
JOB.21.5	Look at me and be astonished 
JOB.21.5	And put your hand over your mouth.
JOB.21.6	Even when I remember, I am troubled 
JOB.21.6	Horror 
JOB.21.7	Why do the wicked 
JOB.21.7	Become old, and become mighty in power?
JOB.21.8	Their children 
JOB.21.8	And their offspring before their eyes.
JOB.21.9	Their houses are safe from fear;
JOB.21.9	And the rod of God is not on them.
JOB.21.10	His bull breeds and does not fail;
JOB.21.10	His cow calves and does not miscarry.
JOB.21.11	They send forth their little ones like a flock,
JOB.21.11	And their children skip about.
JOB.21.12	They lift up their voices 
JOB.21.12	And rejoice to the sound of the flute.
JOB.21.13	They fully enjoy their days in prosperity,
JOB.21.13	And so go down to Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead) in a [peaceful] moment.
JOB.21.14	Yet they say to God, ‘Depart from us,
JOB.21.14	For we do not desire the knowledge of Your ways.
JOB.21.15	Who [and what] is 
JOB.21.15	And what would we gain if we plead with Him?’
JOB.21.16	The counsel of the wicked [and the mystery of God’s dealings with the ungodly] is far from my comprehension.
JOB.21.17	“How often [then] is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out,
JOB.21.17	And that their disaster falls on them?
JOB.21.17	Does God distribute pain 
JOB.21.18	Are they like straw before the wind,
JOB.21.18	And like chaff that the storm steals 
JOB.21.19	Let God repay him so that he may know 
JOB.21.20	Let his own eyes see his destruction,
JOB.21.20	And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
JOB.21.21	For what pleasure does he have in his house 
JOB.21.21	When the number of his months [of life] is cut off?
JOB.21.22	Can anyone teach God knowledge,
JOB.21.22	Seeing that He judges those on high?
JOB.21.23	One dies in his full strength,
JOB.21.23	Being wholly at ease and quiet 
JOB.21.24	His pails are full of milk [his sides are filled out with fat],
JOB.21.24	And the marrow of his bones is moist,
JOB.21.25	Whereas another dies with a bitter soul,
JOB.21.25	Never even tasting pleasure 
JOB.21.26	Together they lie down in the dust,
JOB.21.26	And the worms cover them.
JOB.21.27	“Behold, I know your thoughts,
JOB.21.27	And the plots by which you would wrong me.
JOB.21.28	For you say, ‘Where is the house of the noble man?
JOB.21.28	And where is the tent, the dwelling place of the wicked?’
JOB.21.29	Have you not asked those who travel this way,
JOB.21.29	And do you not recognize their witness?
JOB.21.30	That evil men are [now] reserved for the day of disaster 
JOB.21.30	They will be led away on the day of [God’s] wrath?
JOB.21.31	And who will repay him for what he has done?
JOB.21.32	When he is carried to his grave,
JOB.21.33	The [dirt] clods of the valley are sweet to him [and gently cover him],
JOB.21.33	Moreover, all men will follow after him [to a grave],
JOB.21.33	While countless ones go before him.
JOB.21.34	How then can you vainly comfort me with empty words,
JOB.21.34	Since your answers remain untrue?”
JOB.22.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
JOB.22.2	“Can a vigorous man be of use to God,
JOB.22.2	Or a wise man be useful to himself?
JOB.22.3	Is it any pleasure 
JOB.22.3	Or is it of benefit to Him that you make your ways perfect?
JOB.22.4	Is it because of your fear of Him that He corrects you,
JOB.22.4	That He enters into judgment against you?
JOB.22.5	Is not your wickedness great,
JOB.22.5	And your sins without end?
JOB.22.6	For you have taken pledges of your brothers without cause,
JOB.22.6	And stripped men naked.
JOB.22.7	You have not given water to the weary to drink,
JOB.22.7	And you have withheld bread from the hungry.
JOB.22.8	But the land is possessed by the man with power,
JOB.22.8	And the favored 
JOB.22.9	You have sent widows away empty-handed,
JOB.22.9	And the arms (strength) of the fatherless have been broken.
JOB.22.10	Therefore snares surround you,
JOB.22.10	And sudden dread terrifies 
JOB.22.11	Or darkness, so that you cannot see,
JOB.22.11	And a flood of water covers you.
JOB.22.12	“Is not God in the height of heaven?
JOB.22.12	And behold the distant stars, how high they are!
JOB.22.13	You say, ‘What does God know [about me]?
JOB.22.13	Can He judge through the thick darkness?
JOB.22.14	Thick clouds are a hiding place for Him, so that He cannot see,
JOB.22.14	And He walks on the vault (circle) of the heavens.’
JOB.22.15	Will you keep to the ancient path
JOB.22.15	That wicked men walked [in the time of Noah],
JOB.22.16	Men who were snatched away before their time,
JOB.22.16	Whose foundations were poured out like a river?
JOB.22.17	They said to God, ‘Depart from us!
JOB.22.17	What can the Almighty do for us 
JOB.22.18	Yet He filled their houses with good 
JOB.22.18	But the counsel of the wicked 
JOB.22.19	The righteous see it and are glad;
JOB.22.19	And the innocent mock 
JOB.22.20	‘Surely our adversaries are cut off 
JOB.22.20	And fire has consumed their abundance.’
JOB.22.21	“Now yield 
JOB.22.21	In this way [you will prosper and great] good will come to you.
JOB.22.22	Please receive the law 
JOB.22.22	And establish His words in your heart 
JOB.22.23	If you return to the Almighty [and submit and humble yourself before Him], you will be built up [and restored];
JOB.22.24	And place your gold in the dust,
JOB.22.24	And 
JOB.22.25	And make the Almighty your gold
JOB.22.25	And your precious silver,
JOB.22.26	Then you will have delight in the Almighty,
JOB.22.26	And you will lift up your face to God.
JOB.22.27	You will pray to Him, and He will hear you,
JOB.22.27	And you will pay your vows.
JOB.22.28	You will also decide 
JOB.22.28	And the light [of God’s favor] will shine upon your ways.
JOB.22.29	When you are cast down 
JOB.22.29	And the humble person He will lift up 
JOB.22.30	He will even rescue the one [for whom you intercede] who is not innocent;
JOB.22.30	And he will be rescued through the cleanness of your hands.”
JOB.23.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.23.2	“Even today my complaint is contentious;
JOB.23.2	His hand is heavy despite my groaning.
JOB.23.3	Oh, that I knew where I might find Him,
JOB.23.3	That I might [even] come to His seat!
JOB.23.4	I would present my cause before Him
JOB.23.4	And fill my mouth with arguments.
JOB.23.5	I would learn the words which He would answer,
JOB.23.5	And understand what He would say to me.
JOB.23.6	Would He contend against me with His great power?
JOB.23.6	No, surely He would give attention to me.
JOB.23.7	There the righteous and upright could reason with Him;
JOB.23.7	So I would be acquitted forever by my Judge.
JOB.23.8	“Behold, I go forward (to the east), but He is not there;
JOB.23.8	I go backward (to the west), but I cannot perceive Him;
JOB.23.9	To the left (north) He turns, but I cannot behold Him;
JOB.23.9	He turns to the right hand (south), but I cannot see Him.
JOB.23.10	But He knows the way that I take [and He pays attention to it].
JOB.23.11	My feet have carefully followed His steps;
JOB.23.11	I have kept His ways and not turned aside.
JOB.23.12	I have not departed from the commandment of His lips;
JOB.23.12	I have kept the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.
JOB.23.13	But He is unique 
JOB.23.13	And 
JOB.23.14	For He performs what is planned (appointed) for me,
JOB.23.14	And He is mindful of many such things.
JOB.23.15	Therefore I would be terrified at His presence;
JOB.23.16	For God has made my heart faint,
JOB.23.16	And the Almighty has terrified me,
JOB.23.17	But I am not silenced by the darkness [of these woes that fell on me],
JOB.23.17	Nor by the thick darkness which covers my face.
JOB.24.1	“Why does the Almighty not set seasons for judgment?
JOB.24.1	Why do those who know Him not see His days [for punishment of the wicked]?
JOB.24.2	Some remove the landmarks;
JOB.24.2	They [violently] seize and pasture flocks [appropriating land and flocks openly].
JOB.24.3	They drive away the donkeys of the orphans;
JOB.24.3	They take the widow’s ox for a pledge.
JOB.24.4	They crowd the needy off the road;
JOB.24.4	The poor of the land all hide themselves.
JOB.24.5	Behold, as wild donkeys in the desert,
JOB.24.5	The poor go to their work, diligently seeking food;
JOB.24.5	As bread for their children in the desert.
JOB.24.6	They harvest their fodder in a field [that is not their own],
JOB.24.6	And glean the vineyard of the wicked.
JOB.24.7	They spend the night naked, without clothing,
JOB.24.7	And have no covering against the cold.
JOB.24.8	They are wet from the rain of the mountains
JOB.24.8	And cling to the rock for lack of shelter.
JOB.24.9	Others snatch the fatherless [infants] from the breast [to sell or make them slaves],
JOB.24.9	And against the poor they take a pledge [of clothing].
JOB.24.10	They cause 
JOB.24.10	And they take away the sheaves [of grain] from the hungry.
JOB.24.11	Within the walls [of the wicked] the poor make [olive] oil;
JOB.24.11	They tread [the grapes in] the wine presses, but thirst.
JOB.24.12	From the [populous and crowded] city men groan,
JOB.24.12	And the souls of the wounded cry out for help;
JOB.24.12	Yet God [seemingly] does not pay attention to the wrong [done to them].
JOB.24.13	“Others have been with those who rebel against the light;
JOB.24.13	They do not want to know its ways
JOB.24.13	Nor stay in its paths.
JOB.24.14	The murderer rises at dawn;
JOB.24.14	He kills the poor and the needy,
JOB.24.14	And at night he becomes a thief.
JOB.24.15	The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight,
JOB.24.15	Saying, ‘No eye will see me,’
JOB.24.15	And he covers his face.
JOB.24.16	In the dark they dig into [the penetrable walls of] houses;
JOB.24.16	They shut themselves up by day;
JOB.24.16	They do not know the light [of day].
JOB.24.17	For the morning is the same to him as the thick darkness [of midnight];
JOB.24.17	For he is familiar with the terrors of thick darkness.
JOB.24.18	“They are insignificant on the surface of the water;
JOB.24.18	Their portion is cursed on the earth;
JOB.24.18	They do not turn toward the vineyards.
JOB.24.19	Drought and heat consume the snow waters;
JOB.24.20	A mother will forget him;
JOB.24.20	The worm feeds on him until he is no longer remembered.
JOB.24.20	And wickedness will be broken like a tree [which cannot be restored].
JOB.24.21	He preys on the barren (childless) woman
JOB.24.21	And does no good for the widow.
JOB.24.22	Yet God draws away the mighty by His power;
JOB.24.22	He rises, but no one has assurance of life.
JOB.24.23	God gives them security, and they are supported;
JOB.24.23	And His eyes are on their ways.
JOB.24.24	They are exalted for a little while, and then they are gone;
JOB.24.24	Moreover, they are brought low and like everything [they are] gathered up 
JOB.24.24	Even like the heads of grain they are cut off.
JOB.24.25	And if this is not so, who can prove me a liar
JOB.24.25	And make my speech worthless?”
JOB.25.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,
JOB.25.2	“Dominion and awe belong to God;
JOB.25.2	He establishes peace 
JOB.25.3	Is there any number to His [vast celestial] armies?
JOB.25.3	And upon whom does His light not rise?
JOB.25.4	How then can man be justified 
JOB.25.4	Or how can he who is born of a woman be pure 
JOB.25.5	Behold, even the moon has no brightness [compared to God’s majesty and glory]
JOB.25.5	And the stars are not pure in His sight,
JOB.25.6	How much less man, 
JOB.25.6	And the son of man, 
JOB.26.1	But Job answered and said,
JOB.26.2	“What a help you are to the weak (powerless)!
JOB.26.2	How you have saved the arm that is without strength!
JOB.26.3	How you have counseled the one who has no wisdom!
JOB.26.3	And how abundantly you have provided sound wisdom 
JOB.26.4	To whom have you uttered [these] words?
JOB.26.4	And whose spirit [inspired what] came forth from you?
JOB.26.5	“The spirits of the dead tremble
JOB.26.5	Underneath the waters and their inhabitants.
JOB.26.6	Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead) is naked before God,
JOB.26.6	And Abaddon (the place of destruction) has no covering [from His eyes].
JOB.26.7	And 
JOB.26.8	He wraps the waters in His clouds [which otherwise would spill on earth all at once],
JOB.26.8	And the cloud does not burst under them.
JOB.26.9	He covers the face of the 
JOB.26.9	And spreads His cloud over it.
JOB.26.10	He has inscribed a circular limit (the horizon) on the face of the waters
JOB.26.10	At the boundary between light and darkness.
JOB.26.11	The pillars of the heavens tremble
JOB.26.11	And are terrified at His rebuke.
JOB.26.12	He stirred up the sea by His power,
JOB.26.12	And by His understanding He smashed [proud] 
JOB.26.13	By His breath the heavens are cleared;
JOB.26.13	His hand has pierced the [swiftly] fleeing serpent.
JOB.26.14	Yet these are just the fringes of His ways [mere samples of His power],
JOB.26.14	The faintest whisper of His voice!
JOB.26.14	Who can contemplate the thunder of His [full] mighty power?”
JOB.27.1	Job continued his discourse and said,
JOB.27.2	“As God lives, who has taken away my right 
JOB.27.2	And the Almighty, who has caused bitterness 
JOB.27.3	As long as my life is within me,
JOB.27.3	And the breath of God is [still] in my nostrils,
JOB.27.4	My lips will not speak unjustly,
JOB.27.4	Nor will my tongue utter deceit.
JOB.27.5	Far be it from me that I should admit you are right [in your accusations against me];
JOB.27.5	Until I die, I will not remove my integrity from me.
JOB.27.6	I hold fast my uprightness 
JOB.27.6	My heart does not reproach me for any of my days.
JOB.27.7	“May my enemy be as the wicked,
JOB.27.7	And he who rises up against me be as the unrighteous (unjust).
JOB.27.8	For what is the hope of the godless, even though he has gained [in this world],
JOB.27.8	When God takes his life?
JOB.27.9	Will God hear his cry
JOB.27.9	When trouble 
JOB.27.10	Will he take delight in the Almighty?
JOB.27.10	Will he call on God at all times?
JOB.27.11	I will teach you regarding the hand (power) of God;
JOB.27.11	I will not conceal what is with the Almighty [God’s actual treatment of the wicked].
JOB.27.12	Behold, all of you have seen it;
JOB.27.12	Why then do you act vainly 
JOB.27.13	“This [which I am about to explain] is the portion of a wicked man from God,
JOB.27.13	And the inheritance which tyrants 
JOB.27.14	Though his children are many, they are destined for the sword;
JOB.27.14	And his descendants will not have sufficient bread.
JOB.27.15	Those who survive him will be buried because of the plague,
JOB.27.15	And [their] widows will not be able to weep.
JOB.27.16	Though he heaps up silver like dust
JOB.27.16	And piles up clothing like clay,
JOB.27.17	He may prepare it, but the just will wear it
JOB.27.17	And the innocent will divide the silver.
JOB.27.18	He builds his house like a spider’s web,
JOB.27.18	Like a (temporary) hut which a watchman makes.
JOB.27.19	He lies down rich, but never will again;
JOB.27.19	He opens his eyes, and it is gone.
JOB.27.20	Terrors overtake him like a [suddenly rising] flood;
JOB.27.20	A windstorm steals him away in the night.
JOB.27.21	The east wind lifts him up, and he is gone;
JOB.27.21	It sweeps him out of his place.
JOB.27.22	For it will hurl [thunderbolts of God’s wrath] at him unsparingly 
JOB.27.22	He flees in haste from its power.
JOB.27.23	People will clap their hands at him [to mock and ridicule him]
JOB.27.23	And hiss him out of his place.
JOB.28.1	“Surely there is a mine for silver,
JOB.28.1	And a place where they refine gold.
JOB.28.2	Iron is taken out of the earth,
JOB.28.2	And copper is smelted from the stone ore.
JOB.28.3	And to the farthest bounds he searches out
JOB.28.3	The rock buried in gloom and deep shadow.
JOB.28.4	He breaks open (mine) shafts far away from where people live,
JOB.28.4	[In places] forgotten by the [human] foot;
JOB.28.4	They dangle [in the mines] and hang away from men.
JOB.28.5	[As for] the earth, out of it comes food,
JOB.28.5	But underneath [its surface, down deep] it is turned over as fire.
JOB.28.6	Its stones are the bed of sapphires;
JOB.28.6	It holds dust of gold.
JOB.28.7	The path [deep within] no bird of prey knows,
JOB.28.7	And the falcon’s eye has not caught sight of it.
JOB.28.8	The proud beasts [and their young] have not walked on it,
JOB.28.8	Nor has the 
JOB.28.9	Man puts his hand on [and tears apart] the flinty rock;
JOB.28.9	He overturns the mountains at the base [looking for treasure].
JOB.28.10	He cuts out channels 
JOB.28.10	And his eye sees every precious thing.
JOB.28.11	Man dams up the streams from flowing [so that they do not trickle into the mine],
JOB.28.11	And what is hidden he brings out to the light.
JOB.28.12	“But where can wisdom be found?
JOB.28.12	And where is the place of understanding?
JOB.28.13	Man does not know the value of it;
JOB.28.13	Nor is it found in the land of the living.
JOB.28.14	The deep says, ‘It is not in me’;
JOB.28.14	And the sea says, ‘It is not with me.’
JOB.28.15	It cannot be obtained for pure gold,
JOB.28.15	Nor can silver be weighed as its price.
JOB.28.16	It cannot be valued in [terms of] the gold of Ophir,
JOB.28.16	In the precious onyx 
JOB.28.17	Gold and glass cannot equal wisdom,
JOB.28.17	Nor can it be exchanged for articles of fine gold.
JOB.28.18	No mention of coral and crystal can be made;
JOB.28.18	For the possession of wisdom is even above [that of] rubies 
JOB.28.19	The topaz of Ethiopia cannot compare with it,
JOB.28.19	Nor can it be valued in pure gold.
JOB.28.20	From where then does wisdom come?
JOB.28.20	And where is the place of understanding?
JOB.28.21	It is hidden from the eyes of all the living
JOB.28.21	And concealed from the birds of the heavens.
JOB.28.22	Abaddon (the place of destruction) and Death say,
JOB.28.22	‘We have [only] heard a report of it with our ears.’
JOB.28.23	“God understands the way [to wisdom]
JOB.28.23	And He knows its place [for wisdom is with God alone].
JOB.28.24	For He looks to the ends of the earth
JOB.28.24	And sees everything under the heavens.
JOB.28.25	When He gave weight 
JOB.28.25	And allotted the waters by measure,
JOB.28.26	When He made a limit for the rain
JOB.28.26	And a way for the thunderbolt,
JOB.28.27	Then He saw wisdom and declared it;
JOB.28.27	He established it and searched it out.
JOB.28.28	But to man He said, ‘Behold, the reverential 
JOB.28.28	And to depart from evil is understanding.’ ”
JOB.29.1	And Job again took up his discussion and said,
JOB.29.2	“Oh, that I were as in the months of old,
JOB.29.2	As in the days when God watched over me,
JOB.29.3	When His lamp shone upon my head
JOB.29.4	As I was in the prime of my days,
JOB.29.4	When the friendship 
JOB.29.5	When 
JOB.29.5	And my boys were around me,
JOB.29.6	When my steps [through rich pastures] were washed with butter 
JOB.29.6	And the rock poured out for me streams of oil [from my olive groves].
JOB.29.7	When I went out to the gate of the city,
JOB.29.7	When I took my seat [as a city father] in the square,
JOB.29.8	The young men saw me and hid themselves,
JOB.29.8	The aged arose 
JOB.29.9	The princes stopped talking
JOB.29.9	And put their hands on their mouths;
JOB.29.10	The voices of the nobles were hushed,
JOB.29.10	And their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.
JOB.29.11	For when an ear heard [my name mentioned], it called me happy 
JOB.29.11	And when an eye saw [me], it testified for me [approvingly],
JOB.29.12	Because I rescued the poor who cried for help,
JOB.29.12	And the orphan who had no helper.
JOB.29.13	The blessing of him who was about to perish came upon me,
JOB.29.13	And I made the widow’s heart sing for joy.
JOB.29.14	I put on 
JOB.29.14	My justice was like a robe and a turban!
JOB.29.15	I was eyes to the blind
JOB.29.15	And I was feet to the lame.
JOB.29.16	I was a father to the needy;
JOB.29.16	I investigated the case I did not know [and assured justice].
JOB.29.17	And I smashed the jaws of the wicked
JOB.29.17	And snatched the prey from his teeth.
JOB.29.18	Then I said, ‘I shall die in my nest,
JOB.29.18	And I shall multiply my days as the sand.
JOB.29.19	My root is spread out 
JOB.29.19	And the dew lies all night upon my branch.
JOB.29.20	My glory 
JOB.29.20	And my bow gains [ever] new strength in my hand.’
JOB.29.21	“They listened to me and waited
JOB.29.21	And kept silent for my counsel.
JOB.29.22	After I spoke, they did not speak again,
JOB.29.22	And my speech dropped upon them [like a refreshing shower].
JOB.29.23	They waited for me [and for my words] as for the rain,
JOB.29.23	And they opened their mouths as for the spring rain.
JOB.29.24	I smiled at them when they did not believe,
JOB.29.24	And they did not diminish the light of my face.
JOB.29.25	I chose a way for them and sat as chief,
JOB.29.25	And dwelt as a king among his soldiers,
JOB.29.25	As one who comforts mourners.
JOB.30.1	“But now those younger than I mock 
JOB.30.1	Whose fathers I refused to put with the sheepdogs of my flock.
JOB.30.2	Indeed, how could the strength of their hands profit me?
JOB.30.2	Vigor had perished from them.
JOB.30.3	They are gaunt with want and famine;
JOB.30.3	They gnaw the dry 
JOB.30.4	They pluck [and eat] 
JOB.30.4	And their food is the root of the broom shrub.
JOB.30.5	They are driven from the community;
JOB.30.5	They shout after them as after a thief.
JOB.30.6	They must dwell on the slopes of 
JOB.30.7	Among the bushes they cry out [like wild animals];
JOB.30.7	Beneath the prickly scrub they gather 
JOB.30.8	They have been driven out of the land.
JOB.30.9	“And now I have become [the subject of] their taunting;
JOB.30.9	Yes, I am a 
JOB.30.10	They hate me, they stand aloof from me,
JOB.30.10	And do not refrain from spitting in my face.
JOB.30.11	For God has loosed His bowstring [attacking me] and [He has] afflicted 
JOB.30.11	They have cast off the bridle [of restraint] before me.
JOB.30.12	On my right the [rabble] brood rises;
JOB.30.12	They push my feet away, and they build up their ways of destruction against me [like an advancing army].
JOB.30.13	They break up 
JOB.30.13	They profit from my destruction;
JOB.30.13	No one restrains them.
JOB.30.14	As 
JOB.30.14	Amid the crash [of falling walls] they roll on [over me].
JOB.30.15	Terrors are turned upon me;
JOB.30.15	They chase away my honor 
JOB.30.15	And my prosperity has passed away like a cloud.
JOB.30.16	“And now my soul is poured out within me;
JOB.30.16	The days of affliction have seized me.
JOB.30.17	My bones are pierced [with aching] in the night season,
JOB.30.17	And 
JOB.30.18	By the great force [of my disease] my garment (skin) is disfigured 
JOB.30.18	It binds about me [choking me] like the collar of my coat.
JOB.30.19	God has cast me into the mire [a swampland of crisis],
JOB.30.19	And I have become [worthless] like dust and ashes.
JOB.30.20	I cry to You for help, [Lord,] but You do not answer me;
JOB.30.20	I stand up, but You [only] gaze [indifferently] at me.
JOB.30.21	You have become harsh 
JOB.30.21	With the might of Your hand You [keep me alive only to] persecute me.
JOB.30.22	You lift me up on the wind and cause me to ride [upon it];
JOB.30.22	And You toss me about in the tempest 
JOB.30.23	For I know that You will bring me to death
JOB.30.23	And to the house of meeting [appointed] for all the living.
JOB.30.24	“However, does not one falling in a heap of ruins stretch out his hand?
JOB.30.24	Or in his disaster [will he not] therefore cry out for help?
JOB.30.25	Did I not weep for one whose life was hard 
JOB.30.25	Was not my heart grieved for the needy?
JOB.30.26	When I expected good, then came evil [to me];
JOB.30.26	And when I waited for light, then came darkness.
JOB.30.27	I am seething within 
JOB.30.27	Days of affliction come to meet me.
JOB.30.28	I go about mourning without comfort [my skin blackened by disease, not by the heat of the sun];
JOB.30.28	I stand up in the assembly 
JOB.30.29	I am a brother to [howling] jackals,
JOB.30.29	And a companion to ostriches [which scream dismally].
JOB.30.30	My skin falls from me in blackened flakes,
JOB.30.30	And my bones are burned with fever.
JOB.30.31	Therefore my lyre (harp) is 
JOB.30.31	And my flute for the [sound of the] voices of those who weep.
JOB.31.1	“I have made a covenant (agreement) with my eyes;
JOB.31.1	How then could I gaze [lustfully] at a virgin?
JOB.31.2	For what is the portion I would have from God above,
JOB.31.2	And what heritage from the Almighty on high?
JOB.31.3	Does not tragedy fall [justly] on the unjust
JOB.31.3	And disaster to those who work wickedness?
JOB.31.4	Does not God see my ways
JOB.31.4	And count all my steps?
JOB.31.5	“If I have walked with falsehood,
JOB.31.5	Or if my foot has chased after deceit,
JOB.31.6	Oh, let Him weigh me with accurate scales,
JOB.31.6	And let God know my integrity.
JOB.31.7	If my step has turned away from the way [of God],
JOB.31.7	Or if my heart has [covetously] followed my eyes,
JOB.31.7	Or if any spot [of guilt] has stained my hands,
JOB.31.8	Then let me plant and [let] another eat [from the results of my labor],
JOB.31.8	And let my crops be uprooted 
JOB.31.9	“If my heart has been enticed 
JOB.31.9	Or if I have [covetously] lurked at my neighbor’s door [until his departure],
JOB.31.10	Let my wife grind [meal, like a bond slave] for another [man],
JOB.31.10	And let others 
JOB.31.11	For 
JOB.31.11	Moreover, it would be a sin 
JOB.31.12	For it is a fire which consumes to Abaddon (destruction, ruin, final torment);
JOB.31.12	And [illicit passion] would burn 
JOB.31.13	“If I have despised 
JOB.31.13	When they filed a complaint against me,
JOB.31.14	What then could I do when God arises [to judge me]?
JOB.31.14	When He calls me to account, what will I answer Him?
JOB.31.15	Did not He who made me in the womb make my servant,
JOB.31.15	And did not the same One fashion us both in the womb?
JOB.31.16	“If I have withheld from the poor what 
JOB.31.16	Or have caused the eyes of the widow to look in vain [for relief],
JOB.31.17	Or have eaten my morsel [of food] alone,
JOB.31.17	And did not share it with the orphan
JOB.31.18	(But from my youth the orphan grew up with me as with a father,
JOB.31.18	And from my mother’s womb I have been the widow’s guide),
JOB.31.19	If I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing,
JOB.31.19	Or any poor person without covering,
JOB.31.20	If his loins have not thanked 
JOB.31.20	And if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep,
JOB.31.21	If I have lifted my hand against the orphan,
JOB.31.21	Because I saw [that the judges would be] my help at the [council] gate,
JOB.31.22	Then let my shoulder fall away from its socket,
JOB.31.22	And my arm be broken off at the elbow.
JOB.31.23	For tragedy from God is a terror to me,
JOB.31.23	And because of His majesty 
JOB.31.24	“If I have put my trust 
JOB.31.24	Or have declared fine gold my hope 
JOB.31.25	If I gloated 
JOB.31.25	And because my [powerful] hand [alone] had obtained so much,
JOB.31.26	If I beheld the sun [as an object of worship] when it shone
JOB.31.26	Or the moon going in its splendor,
JOB.31.27	And my heart became secretly enticed [by them],
JOB.31.27	And my hand threw a kiss from my mouth [in respect to them],
JOB.31.28	This also would have been [a heinous] sin 
JOB.31.28	For I would have denied God above.
JOB.31.29	“Have I rejoiced at the destruction of the enemy [who hated me],
JOB.31.29	Or exulted [in malicious triumph] when evil overtook him?
JOB.31.30	No, I have not allowed my mouth to sin
JOB.31.30	By cursing my enemy 
JOB.31.31	I assure you, the men of my tent have said,
JOB.31.31	‘Who can find one [in need] who has not been satisfied with his meat’?
JOB.31.32	The stranger has not lodged in the street,
JOB.31.32	Because I have opened my door to the traveler.
JOB.31.33	Have I concealed my transgressions like Adam 
JOB.31.33	By hiding my wickedness in my bosom,
JOB.31.34	Because I feared the great multitude,
JOB.31.34	And the contempt of families terrified me,
JOB.31.34	So that I kept silence 
JOB.31.35	Oh, that I had one to listen to me!
JOB.31.35	Look, here is my signature (mark);
JOB.31.35	Let the Almighty answer me!
JOB.31.35	Let my adversary write out His indictment [and put His vague accusations in tangible form].
JOB.31.36	Surely I would [proudly] bear it on my shoulder,
JOB.31.36	And bind the scroll around my head like a crown.
JOB.31.37	I would count out to Him the number of my steps [with every detail of my life],
JOB.31.37	Approaching His presence as 
JOB.31.38	“For if my land has cried out against me,
JOB.31.38	And its furrows weep together;
JOB.31.39	If I have eaten its fruits without paying for them,
JOB.31.39	Or have caused its [rightful] owners to lose their lives,
JOB.31.40	Let thorns grow instead of wheat,
JOB.31.40	And stinkweed 
JOB.31.40	So the words of Job [with his friends] are finished.
JOB.32.1	So these three men ceased answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes [and could not be persuaded otherwise by them]. 
JOB.32.2	But Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became indignant. His indignation was kindled 
JOB.32.3	Elihu’s anger burned against Job’s three friends because they had found no answer [and were unable to determine Job’s error], and yet they had condemned Job 
JOB.32.4	Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because the others were years older than he. 
JOB.32.5	And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouths of these three men, he burned with anger.
JOB.32.6	Then Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite said,
JOB.32.6	“I am young, and you are aged;
JOB.32.6	For that reason I was anxious and dared not tell you what I think.
JOB.32.7	I thought age should speak,
JOB.32.7	And a multitude of years should teach wisdom.
JOB.32.8	But there is [a vital force and] a spirit [of intelligence] in man,
JOB.32.8	And the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding.
JOB.32.9	Those [who are] abundant 
JOB.32.9	Nor may the elders [always] understand justice.
JOB.32.10	Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me;
JOB.32.10	I also will give you my opinion [about Job’s situation] 
JOB.32.11	“You see, I waited for your words,
JOB.32.11	I listened to your [wise] reasons,
JOB.32.11	While you pondered 
JOB.32.12	I even paid close attention to [what] you [said],
JOB.32.12	Indeed, not one of you convinced Job [nor could you refute him],
JOB.32.12	Not one of you supplied [satisfactory] answers to his words.
JOB.32.13	Beware if you say,
JOB.32.13	‘We have found wisdom;
JOB.32.13	God thrusts Job down [justly], not man [for God alone is dealing with him].’
JOB.32.14	Now Job has not directed his words against me [therefore I have no reason to be offended],
JOB.32.14	Nor will I answer him with arguments like yours. [I speak for truth, not for revenge.]
JOB.32.15	“They (Job’s friends) are dismayed 
JOB.32.15	The words have moved away 
JOB.32.16	“And shall I wait, because they say nothing,
JOB.32.16	But stand still and say no more?
JOB.32.17	I too will give my share of answers;
JOB.32.17	I too will express my opinion 
JOB.32.18	For I am full of words;
JOB.32.18	The spirit within me constrains me.
JOB.32.19	My belly is like unvented wine;
JOB.32.19	Like new wineskins it is about to burst.
JOB.32.20	I must speak so that I may get relief;
JOB.32.20	I will open my lips and answer.
JOB.32.21	I will not [I warn you] be partial to any man [that is, let my respect for you mitigate what I say];
JOB.32.21	Nor flatter any man.
JOB.32.22	For I do not know how to flatter, [in an appropriate way, and I fear that],
JOB.32.22	My Maker would soon take me away.
JOB.33.1	“However, Job, please listen to my words,
JOB.33.1	And pay attention to everything I say.
JOB.33.2	Behold, I have opened my mouth [to begin my speech];
JOB.33.2	My tongue in my mouth is going to speak.
JOB.33.3	My words will express the uprightness of my heart,
JOB.33.3	And my lips will speak what they know with utter sincerity.
JOB.33.4	The Spirit of God has made me,
JOB.33.4	And the breath of 
JOB.33.5	Answer me, if you can;
JOB.33.5	Set yourselves before me, take your stand.
JOB.33.6	Behold, I belong to God like you;
JOB.33.6	I too was formed out of the clay.
JOB.33.7	Behold, I will not make you afraid or terrified of me [for I am only mortal and not God],
JOB.33.7	Nor should any pressure from me weigh heavily upon you.
JOB.33.8	“Surely you have spoken in my hearing,
JOB.33.8	And I have heard the sound of your words, saying:
JOB.33.9	‘I am pure, without transgression;
JOB.33.9	I am innocent and there is no guilt in me.
JOB.33.10	Behold, God finds pretexts against me;
JOB.33.10	He counts me as His enemy.
JOB.33.11	He puts my feet in the stocks [to hinder and humiliate me];
JOB.33.11	He [suspiciously] watches all my paths,’ [you say].
JOB.33.12	Look, let me answer you, in this you are not right 
JOB.33.12	For God is greater 
JOB.33.13	“Why do you complain against Him?
JOB.33.13	That He does not answer [you with] all His doings.
JOB.33.14	For God speaks once,
JOB.33.14	And 
JOB.33.15	In a dream, a vision of the night [one may hear God’s voice],
JOB.33.15	When deep sleep falls on men
JOB.33.15	While slumbering upon the bed,
JOB.33.16	Then He opens the ears of men
JOB.33.16	And seals their instruction,
JOB.33.17	That He may turn man aside 
JOB.33.17	And keep him from pride;
JOB.33.18	He holds back his soul from the pit [of destruction],
JOB.33.18	And his life from passing over into Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead).
JOB.33.19	“Man is also disciplined with pain on his bed,
JOB.33.19	And with unceasing complaint in his bones,
JOB.33.20	So that his life makes him loathe food,
JOB.33.20	And his soul [loathe] even his favorite dishes.
JOB.33.21	His flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen,
JOB.33.21	And his bones which were not seen now stick out.
JOB.33.22	Then his soul draws near to the pit [of destruction],
JOB.33.22	And his life to those who bring death (the destroyers).
JOB.33.23	“If there is an angel as a mediator for him,
JOB.33.23	One out of a thousand,
JOB.33.23	To explain to a man what is right for him [that is, how to be in right standing with God],
JOB.33.24	Then 
JOB.33.24	‘Spare him from going down to the pit [of destruction];
JOB.33.24	I have found a ransom [a consideration, or reason for redemption, an atonement]!’
JOB.33.25	Let his flesh be restored 
JOB.33.25	Let him return to the days of his youthful strength.
JOB.33.26	He will pray to God, and He shall be favorable to him,
JOB.33.26	So that he looks at His face with joy;
JOB.33.26	For God restores to man His righteousness [that is, his right standing with God—with its joys].
JOB.33.27	He sings out to other men,
JOB.33.27	‘I have sinned and perverted that which was right,
JOB.33.27	And it was not proper for me!
JOB.33.28	God has redeemed my life from going to the pit [of destruction],
JOB.33.28	And my life shall see the light.’ ”
JOB.33.29	[Elihu comments,] “Behold, God does all these 
JOB.33.30	To bring his life back from the pit [of destruction],
JOB.33.30	That he may be enlightened with the light of the living.
JOB.33.31	Pay attention, Job, listen to me;
JOB.33.31	Keep silent, and I will speak.
JOB.33.32	If you have anything to say, answer me;
JOB.33.32	Speak, for I desire to justify you.
JOB.33.33	If not [and you have nothing to say], listen to me;
JOB.33.33	Keep silent, and I will teach you wisdom.”
JOB.34.1	Elihu continued 
JOB.34.2	“Hear my words, you wise men,
JOB.34.2	And listen to me, you who have [so much] knowledge.
JOB.34.3	For the ear puts words to the test
JOB.34.3	As the palate tastes food.
JOB.34.4	Let us choose for ourselves that which is right;
JOB.34.4	Let us know among ourselves what is good.
JOB.34.5	For Job has said, ‘I am righteous [and innocent],
JOB.34.5	But God has taken away my right;
JOB.34.6	Although I am right, I am accounted a liar.
JOB.34.6	My wound is incurable, 
JOB.34.7	What man is like Job,
JOB.34.7	Who drinks up derision like water,
JOB.34.8	Who goes in company with those who do evil
JOB.34.8	And walks with wicked men?
JOB.34.9	For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing
JOB.34.9	When he takes delight 
JOB.34.10	“Therefore hear me, you men of understanding.
JOB.34.10	Far be it from God that He would do wickedness,
JOB.34.10	And from the Almighty to do wrong.
JOB.34.11	For God pays a man according to his work,
JOB.34.11	And He will make every man find [appropriate] 
JOB.34.12	Surely God will not act wickedly,
JOB.34.12	Nor will the Almighty pervert justice.
JOB.34.13	Who put God in charge over the earth?
JOB.34.13	And who has laid 
JOB.34.14	If God should determine to do so,
JOB.34.14	If He should gather to Himself [that is, withdraw from man] His [life-giving] spirit and His breath,
JOB.34.15	All flesh would perish together,
JOB.34.15	And man would return to dust.
JOB.34.16	“If 
JOB.34.16	Listen to the sound of my words.
JOB.34.17	Shall one who hates justice [and is an enemy of right] govern?
JOB.34.17	And will you condemn Him who is just 
JOB.34.18	God who says to a king, ‘You are worthless 
JOB.34.18	Or to princes 
JOB.34.19	Who is not partial to princes,
JOB.34.19	Nor does He regard the rich above the poor,
JOB.34.19	For they all are the work of His hands.
JOB.34.20	In a moment they die, even at midnight
JOB.34.20	The people are shaken and pass away,
JOB.34.20	And the powerful are taken away without a [human] hand.
JOB.34.21	“For God’s eyes are on the ways of a man,
JOB.34.21	And He sees all his steps.
JOB.34.22	There is no darkness nor deep shadow
JOB.34.22	Where the evildoers may hide themselves.
JOB.34.23	For He sets no appointed time for a man,
JOB.34.23	That he should appear before Him in judgment.
JOB.34.24	He breaks mighty men without inquiry,
JOB.34.24	And sets others in their place.
JOB.34.25	Therefore He knows of their works,
JOB.34.25	And He overthrows them in the night,
JOB.34.25	So that they are crushed 
JOB.34.26	He strikes them like the wicked
JOB.34.26	In a public place,
JOB.34.27	Because they turned aside from following Him
JOB.34.27	And would not consider 
JOB.34.28	So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him,
JOB.34.28	And He heard the cry of the afflicted.
JOB.34.29	When He keeps quiet, who then can condemn?
JOB.34.29	When He hides His face [withdrawing His favor and help], who then can behold Him [and make supplication to Him],
JOB.34.29	Whether it be a nation or a man by himself?—
JOB.34.30	So that godless men would not rule
JOB.34.30	Nor be snares for the people.
JOB.34.31	“For has anyone said to God,
JOB.34.31	‘I have endured 
JOB.34.31	I will not offend 
JOB.34.32	Teach me what I do not see [in regard to how I have sinned];
JOB.34.32	If I have done wrong (injustice, unrighteousness),
JOB.34.32	I will not do it again’?
JOB.34.33	Shall God’s retribution [for your sins] be on your terms, because you refuse to accept it?
JOB.34.33	For you must do the choosing, and not I;
JOB.34.33	Therefore say what you [truthfully] know.
JOB.34.34	Men of understanding will tell me,
JOB.34.34	Indeed, every wise man who hears me [will agree],
JOB.34.35	‘Job speaks without knowledge,
JOB.34.35	And his words are without wisdom 
JOB.34.36	Job ought to be tried 
JOB.34.36	Because he answers like wicked men!
JOB.34.37	For he adds rebellion [in his unsubmissive, defiant attitude toward God] to his [unacknowledged] sin;
JOB.34.37	He claps his hands among us [in open mockery and contempt of God],
JOB.34.37	And he multiplies his words [of accusation] against God.’ ”
JOB.35.1	Elihu continued speaking [to Job] and said,
JOB.35.2	“Do you think this is according to [your] justice?
JOB.35.2	Do you say, ‘My righteousness is more than God’s’?
JOB.35.3	For you say, ‘What advantage have you [by living a righteous life]?
JOB.35.3	What profit will I have, more [by being righteous] than if I had sinned?’
JOB.35.4	I will answer you,
JOB.35.4	And your companions with you.
JOB.35.5	Look to the heavens and see;
JOB.35.5	And behold the skies which are [much] higher than you.
JOB.35.6	If you have sinned, what do you accomplish against Him?
JOB.35.6	And if your transgressions are multiplied, what have you done to Him?
JOB.35.7	If you are righteous, what do you give God,
JOB.35.7	Or what does He receive from your hand?
JOB.35.8	Your wickedness 
JOB.35.8	And your righteousness 
JOB.35.9	“Because of the multitudes of oppressions 
JOB.35.9	They cry for help because of the [violent] arm of the mighty.
JOB.35.10	But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker,
JOB.35.10	Who gives songs [of rejoicing] in the night,
JOB.35.11	Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth
JOB.35.11	And makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?’
JOB.35.12	The people cry out, but He does not answer
JOB.35.12	Because of the pride of evil men.
JOB.35.13	Surely God will not listen to an empty cry [which lacks trust],
JOB.35.13	Nor will the Almighty regard it.
JOB.35.14	Even though you say that you do not see Him [when missing His righteous judgment on earth],
JOB.35.14	Yet your case is before Him, and you must wait for Him!
JOB.35.15	And now, because He has not [quickly] punished in His anger,
JOB.35.15	Nor has He acknowledged transgression 
JOB.35.16	Job uselessly opens his mouth
JOB.35.16	And multiplies words without knowledge [drawing the worthless conclusion that the righteous have no more advantage than the wicked].”
JOB.36.1	Elihu continued and said,
JOB.36.2	“Bear with me a little longer, and I will show you,
JOB.36.2	That there is yet more to say on God’s behalf.
JOB.36.3	I will bring my knowledge from afar,
JOB.36.3	And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
JOB.36.4	For truly my words are not false;
JOB.36.4	He who is perfect in knowledge is with you.
JOB.36.5	Behold, God is mighty, and yet does not despise 
JOB.36.6	He does not prolong the life of the wicked,
JOB.36.6	But gives the afflicted their justice.
JOB.36.7	He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous [those in right standing with Him];
JOB.36.7	But with kings upon the throne
JOB.36.7	He has seated them forever, and they are exalted.
JOB.36.8	And if they are bound in bonds [of adversity],
JOB.36.8	And held by cords of affliction,
JOB.36.9	Then He declares to them [the true character of] their deeds
JOB.36.9	And their transgressions, that they have acted arrogantly [with presumption and notions of self-sufficiency].
JOB.36.10	He opens their ears to instruction 
JOB.36.10	And commands that they return from evil.
JOB.36.11	If they hear and serve 
JOB.36.11	They will end their days in prosperity
JOB.36.11	And their years in pleasantness 
JOB.36.12	But if they do not hear 
JOB.36.12	And they will die [in ignorance] without [true] knowledge.
JOB.36.13	But the godless in heart store up anger [at the divine discipline];
JOB.36.13	They do not cry [to Him] for help when He binds them [with cords of affliction].
JOB.36.14	They die in youth,
JOB.36.14	And their life 
JOB.36.15	He rescues the afflicted in their affliction,
JOB.36.15	And opens their ears [so that they pay attention to His voice] in 
JOB.36.16	Then indeed, He enticed you from the mouth of distress 
JOB.36.16	Into a broad place where there is no constraint 
JOB.36.16	And that which was set on your table was full of fatness (rich food).
JOB.36.17	“But you [Job] were full of judgment on the wicked,
JOB.36.17	Judgment and justice take hold 
JOB.36.18	Do not let wrath entice you into scoffing;
JOB.36.18	And do not let the greatness 
JOB.36.19	Will your wealth [be sufficient to] keep you from [the confinement of] distress,
JOB.36.19	Or will all the force of your strength do it?
JOB.36.20	Do not long for the night,
JOB.36.20	When people vanish from their places.
JOB.36.21	Take heed 
JOB.36.21	For you have chosen this [the vice of complaining against God] rather than [learning from] affliction.
JOB.36.22	Behold, God is exalted in His power;
JOB.36.22	Who is a ruler 
JOB.36.23	Who has appointed God His way,
JOB.36.23	And who can say [to Him], ‘You have done wrong’?
JOB.36.24	“Remember that you should magnify God’s work,
JOB.36.24	Of which men have sung.
JOB.36.25	All men have seen God’s work;
JOB.36.25	Man looks at it from a distance.
JOB.36.26	Behold, God is exalted, and we do not know 
JOB.36.26	The number of His years is unsearchable.
JOB.36.27	For He draws up the drops of water,
JOB.36.27	They distill rain from the mist,
JOB.36.28	Which the clouds pour down,
JOB.36.28	They drop abundantly upon mankind.”
JOB.36.29	“Can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds
JOB.36.29	Or the thundering of His pavilion?
JOB.36.30	Behold, He spreads His lightning around Him [against the dark clouds],
JOB.36.30	And He covers the depths of the sea.
JOB.36.31	For by these [mighty acts] He judges the peoples;
JOB.36.31	He gives food in abundance.
JOB.36.32	He covers 
JOB.36.32	And commands it to strike the mark.
JOB.36.33	His thundering voice declares [awesomely] His presence;
JOB.36.33	The cattle also are told of His coming storm.
JOB.37.1	“Indeed, at 
JOB.37.1	And leaps out of its place.
JOB.37.2	Listen carefully to the thunder of His voice,
JOB.37.2	And the rumbling that goes out of His mouth!
JOB.37.3	He lets it loose under the whole heaven,
JOB.37.3	And His lightning to the ends of the earth.
JOB.37.4	After it, His voice roars;
JOB.37.4	He thunders with the voice of His majesty,
JOB.37.4	And He does not restrain His lightning [against His adversaries] when His voice is heard.
JOB.37.5	God thunders marvelously with His voice;
JOB.37.5	He does great things which we cannot comprehend.
JOB.37.6	For He says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth’;
JOB.37.6	And [He speaks] to the showers and to the downpour [of His mighty rains], ‘Be strong.’
JOB.37.7	God seals (brings to a standstill, stops) [by severe weather] the hand of every man,
JOB.37.7	That all men [whom He has made] may know His work [that is, His sovereign power and their subjection to it].
JOB.37.8	Then the beast goes into its lair
JOB.37.8	And remains in its hiding place.
JOB.37.9	Out of its chamber comes the storm,
JOB.37.9	And cold from the north wind.
JOB.37.10	Ice is made by the breath of God,
JOB.37.10	And the expanse of the waters is frozen.
JOB.37.11	He loads the thick cloud with moisture;
JOB.37.11	He disperses the cloud of His lightning.
JOB.37.12	Its direction is turned around by His guidance,
JOB.37.12	That it may do whatever He commands it
JOB.37.12	On the face of the inhabited earth.
JOB.37.13	Whether [it be] for correction, or for His earth [generally]
JOB.37.13	Or for [His] mercy 
JOB.37.14	“Listen to this, Job;
JOB.37.14	Stand still and consider the wonders of God.
JOB.37.15	Do you know how God establishes 
JOB.37.15	And makes the lightning of His [storm] cloud shine?
JOB.37.16	Do you know about the layers of thick clouds [and how they are balanced and poised in the heavens],
JOB.37.16	The wonderful works of Him who is perfect in knowledge,
JOB.37.17	You whose garments are hot,
JOB.37.17	When He quiets the earth [in sultry summer] with the [oppressive] south wind?
JOB.37.18	Can you, with Him, spread out the sky,
JOB.37.18	Strong as a molten mirror?
JOB.37.19	Tell us [Job] what words [of man] shall we say to such a Being;
JOB.37.19	We cannot state 
JOB.37.20	So shall it be told Him that I wish to speak?
JOB.37.20	Or should a man say that he would be swallowed up [and destroyed by God]?
JOB.37.21	“Now people cannot look at the light when it is bright in the skies [without being blinded],
JOB.37.21	When the wind has passed and cleared them.
JOB.37.22	Out of the north comes golden 
JOB.37.22	Around God is awesome splendor 
JOB.37.23	The Almighty—we cannot find Him;
JOB.37.23	He is exalted in power
JOB.37.23	And He will not do violence to [nor disregard] justice and abundant righteousness.
JOB.37.24	Men therefore fear Him;
JOB.37.24	He does not regard 
JOB.38.1	Then the L
JOB.38.2	“Who is this that darkens counsel [questioning my authority and wisdom]
JOB.38.2	By words without knowledge?
JOB.38.3	Now 
JOB.38.3	And I will ask you, and you instruct Me!
JOB.38.4	Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?
JOB.38.4	Tell 
JOB.38.5	Who determined the measurements [of the earth], if you know?
JOB.38.5	Or who stretched the [measuring] line on it?
JOB.38.6	On what were its foundations fastened?
JOB.38.6	Or who laid its cornerstone,
JOB.38.7	When the morning stars sang together
JOB.38.7	And all the sons of God (angels) shouted for joy?
JOB.38.8	“Or who enclosed the sea with doors
JOB.38.8	When it burst forth and went out of the womb;
JOB.38.9	When I made the clouds its garment
JOB.38.9	And thick darkness its swaddling band,
JOB.38.10	And marked for it My [appointed] boundary
JOB.38.10	And set bars and doors [defining the shorelines],
JOB.38.11	And said, ‘This far you shall come, but no farther;
JOB.38.11	And here your proud waves shall stop’?
JOB.38.12	“
JOB.38.12	And caused the dawn to know its place,
JOB.38.13	So that light may take hold of the corners of the earth
JOB.38.13	And shake the wickedness out of it?
JOB.38.14	The earth is changed like clay 
JOB.38.14	And the things [of the earth] stand out like a [multi-colored] garment.
JOB.38.15	Their light is withheld from the wicked,
JOB.38.15	And the uplifted arm is broken.
JOB.38.16	“Have you entered 
JOB.38.16	Or [have you] walked in the recesses of the deep?
JOB.38.17	Have the gates of death been revealed to you,
JOB.38.17	Or have you seen the gates of deep darkness?
JOB.38.18	Have you understood the expanse of the earth?
JOB.38.18	Tell 
JOB.38.19	“Where is the 
JOB.38.19	And as for darkness, where is its place,
JOB.38.20	That you may take it to its territory
JOB.38.20	And that you may know the paths to its house?
JOB.38.21	You [must] know, since you were born then,
JOB.38.21	And 
JOB.38.22	Have you entered the storehouses of the snow,
JOB.38.22	Or have you seen the storehouses of the hail,
JOB.38.23	Which I have reserved for the time of trouble,
JOB.38.23	For the day of battle and war?
JOB.38.24	Where is the way that the light is distributed,
JOB.38.24	Or the east wind scattered over the earth?
JOB.38.25	“Who has prepared a channel for the torrents of rain 
JOB.38.25	Or a path for the thunderbolt,
JOB.38.26	To bring rain on the uninhabited land,
JOB.38.26	And on the desert where no man lives,
JOB.38.27	To satisfy the barren and desolate ground
JOB.38.27	And to make the seeds of grass to sprout?
JOB.38.28	Has the rain a father?
JOB.38.28	Or who has begotten the drops of dew?
JOB.38.29	Out of whose womb has come the ice?
JOB.38.29	And the frost of heaven, who has given it birth?
JOB.38.30	Water becomes like stone [and hides itself],
JOB.38.30	And the surface of the deep is frozen 
JOB.38.31	“Can you bind the chains of [the cluster of stars called] Pleiades,
JOB.38.31	Or loose the cords of [the constellation] Orion?
JOB.38.32	Can you lead forth a 
JOB.38.32	And guide [the stars of] the Bear with her 
JOB.38.33	Do you know the ordinances of the heavens,
JOB.38.33	Or [can you] establish their rule over the earth?
JOB.38.34	“Can you lift up your voice to the clouds,
JOB.38.34	So that an abundance of water will cover you?
JOB.38.35	Can you send forth lightnings that they may go
JOB.38.35	And say to you, ‘Here we are’?
JOB.38.36	Who has put wisdom in the innermost being [of man, or in the layers of clouds]
JOB.38.36	Or given understanding to the mind [of man, or to the heavenly display]?
JOB.38.37	Who can count the clouds by [earthly] wisdom,
JOB.38.37	Or pour out the water jars of the heavens,
JOB.38.38	When the dust hardens into a mass
JOB.38.38	And the clods stick together [because of the heat]?

JOB.38.39	Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions
JOB.38.40	When they crouch in their dens
JOB.38.40	And lie in wait in their lair?
JOB.38.41	Who provides prey for the raven
JOB.38.41	When its young cry to God
JOB.38.41	And wander about without food?
JOB.39.1	“Do you know the time when the wild goats of the rock give birth [to their young]?

JOB.39.2	Or do you know the time when they give birth?
JOB.39.3	They kneel down, they bring forth their young,
JOB.39.3	They cast out their labor pains.
JOB.39.4	Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open field;
JOB.39.4	They leave and do not return to them.
JOB.39.5	“Who sent out the wild donkey free [from dependence on man]?
JOB.39.5	And who has loosed the bonds of the wild donkey [to survive in the wild],
JOB.39.6	To whom I gave the wilderness as his home
JOB.39.6	And the salt land as his dwelling place?
JOB.39.7	He scorns the tumult of the city,
JOB.39.7	And does not hear the shouting of the taskmaster.
JOB.39.8	He explores the mountains as his pasture
JOB.39.8	And searches after every green thing.
JOB.39.9	Will the wild ox be willing to serve you,
JOB.39.9	Or remain beside your manger at night?
JOB.39.10	Can you bind the wild ox with a harness [to the plow] in the furrow?
JOB.39.10	Or will he plow the valleys for you?
JOB.39.11	Will you trust him because his strength is great
JOB.39.11	And leave your labor to him?
JOB.39.12	Will you have faith 
JOB.39.12	And gather it from your threshing floor?
JOB.39.13	“The [flightless] wings of the ostrich wave joyously;
JOB.39.13	With the pinion (shackles, fetters) and plumage of love,
JOB.39.14	For she leaves her eggs on the ground
JOB.39.14	And warms them in the dust,
JOB.39.15	Forgetting that a foot may crush them,
JOB.39.15	Or that the wild beast may trample them.
JOB.39.16	She treats her young cruelly, as if they were not hers;
JOB.39.16	Though her labor is in vain because she is unconcerned [for the safety of her brood],
JOB.39.17	For God has made her forget wisdom,
JOB.39.17	And has not given her a share of understanding.
JOB.39.18	Yet when she lifts herself 
JOB.39.18	[So swift is she that] she laughs at the horse and his rider.
JOB.39.19	“Have you given the horse his might?
JOB.39.19	Have you clothed his neck with quivering 
JOB.39.20	Have you [Job] made him leap like a locust?
JOB.39.20	The majesty of his snorting [nostrils] is terrible.
JOB.39.21	He paws in the valley and rejoices in his strength;
JOB.39.21	He goes out to meet the weapons [of armed men].
JOB.39.22	He laughs at fear and is not dismayed;
JOB.39.22	And [in battle] he does not turn back from the sword.
JOB.39.23	The quiver rattles against him,
JOB.39.23	[As do] the flashing spear and the lance [of his rider].
JOB.39.24	With fierceness and rage he races to devour the ground,
JOB.39.24	And he does not stand still at the sound of the [war] trumpet.
JOB.39.25	As often as the trumpet sounds he says, ‘Aha!’
JOB.39.25	And he smells the battle from far away,
JOB.39.25	And 
JOB.39.26	“Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars,
JOB.39.26	Stretching his wings toward the south [as winter approaches]?
JOB.39.27	Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up
JOB.39.27	And makes his nest on high [in an inaccessible place]?
JOB.39.28	On the cliff he dwells and remains [securely],
JOB.39.28	Upon the point of the rock and the inaccessible stronghold.
JOB.39.29	From there he spies out the prey;
JOB.39.29	His eyes see it from far away.
JOB.39.30	His young ones suck up blood;
JOB.39.30	And where the slain are, there is he.”
JOB.40.1	Then the L
JOB.40.2	“Will the faultfinder contend with the Almighty?
JOB.40.2	Let him who disputes with God answer it.”
JOB.40.3	Then Job replied to the L
JOB.40.4	“Behold, I am of little importance 
JOB.40.4	I lay my hand on my mouth.
JOB.40.5	I have spoken once, but I will not reply again—
JOB.40.5	Indeed, twice [I have answered], and I will add nothing further.”
JOB.40.6	Then the L
JOB.40.7	“Now 
JOB.40.7	And I will ask you, and you instruct Me.
JOB.40.8	Will you really annul My judgment 
JOB.40.8	Will you condemn Me [your God] that you may [appear to] be righteous 
JOB.40.9	Have you an arm like God,
JOB.40.9	And can you thunder with a voice like His?
JOB.40.10	“Adorn yourself with eminence and dignity [since you question the Almighty],
JOB.40.10	And array yourself with honor and majesty.
JOB.40.11	Pour out the overflowings of your wrath,
JOB.40.11	And look at everyone who is proud and make him low.
JOB.40.12	Look at everyone who is proud, and humble him,
JOB.40.12	And [if you are so able] tread down the wicked where they stand.
JOB.40.13	[Crush and] hide them in the dust together;
JOB.40.13	Shut them up in the hidden place [the house of death].
JOB.40.14	[If you can do all this, Job, proving your divine power] then I [God] will also praise you 
JOB.40.14	That your own right hand can save you.
JOB.40.15	“Behold now, 
JOB.40.15	He eats grass like an ox.
JOB.40.16	See now, his strength is in his loins
JOB.40.16	And his power is in the muscles 
JOB.40.17	He sways his tail like a cedar;
JOB.40.17	The tendons of his thighs are twisted 
JOB.40.18	His bones are tubes of bronze;
JOB.40.18	His 
JOB.40.19	“He is the first [in magnitude and power] of the works of God;
JOB.40.19	[Only] He who made him can bring near His sword [to master him].
JOB.40.20	Surely the mountains bring him food,
JOB.40.20	And all the wild animals play there.
JOB.40.21	He lies down under the lotus plants,
JOB.40.21	In the hidden shelter of the reeds in the marsh.
JOB.40.22	The lotus plants cover him with their shade;
JOB.40.22	The willows of the brook surround him.
JOB.40.23	If a river rages 
JOB.40.23	He is confident, though the Jordan [River] swells and rushes against his mouth.
JOB.40.24	Can anyone capture him when he is on watch,
JOB.40.24	Or pierce his nose with barbs [to trap him]?
JOB.41.1	“
JOB.41.1	Or press down his tongue with a cord?
JOB.41.2	Can you put a rope [made] of rushes into his nose
JOB.41.2	Or pierce his jaw through with a hook?
JOB.41.3	Will he make many supplications to you [begging to be spared]?
JOB.41.3	Or will he speak soft words to you [to coax you to treat him kindly]?
JOB.41.4	Will he make a covenant 
JOB.41.4	Will you take him for your servant forever?
JOB.41.5	Will you play with him as with a bird?
JOB.41.5	Or will you bind him [and put him on a leash] for your maidens?
JOB.41.6	Will traders bargain over him?
JOB.41.6	Will they divide him up among the merchants?
JOB.41.7	Can you fill his skin with harpoons,
JOB.41.7	Or his head with fishing spears?
JOB.41.8	Lay your hand on him;
JOB.41.8	Remember the battle [with him]; you will not do such [an ill-advised thing] again!
JOB.41.9	Will not one be overwhelmed even at the sight of him?
JOB.41.10	No one is so fierce [and foolhardy] that he dares to stir up Leviathan;
JOB.41.10	Who then is he who can stand before Me [or dares to contend with Me, the beast’s creator]?
JOB.41.11	Who has first given to Me that I should repay him?
JOB.41.11	Whatever is under the whole heaven is Mine. [Who can have a claim against Me who made the unmastered beast?]
JOB.41.12	“I will not keep silence concerning his limbs,
JOB.41.12	Nor his mighty strength, nor his orderly frame.
JOB.41.13	Who can penetrate 
JOB.41.13	Who can come to his jaws with a double bridle?
JOB.41.14	Who can open the doors (jaws) of his face?
JOB.41.14	Around his [open jaws and] teeth there is terror.
JOB.41.15	His strong scales are his pride,
JOB.41.15	Bound together as with a tight seal.
JOB.41.16	One is so near to another
JOB.41.16	That no air can come between them.
JOB.41.17	They are joined one to another;
JOB.41.17	They stick together and cannot be separated.
JOB.41.18	His sneezes flash forth light,
JOB.41.18	And his eyes are like the [reddish] eyelids of the dawn.
JOB.41.19	Out of his mouth go burning torches,
JOB.41.19	And sparks of fire leap out.
JOB.41.20	Out of his nostrils smoke goes forth
JOB.41.20	As from a boiling pot and [as from] 
JOB.41.21	His breath kindles coals,
JOB.41.21	And a flame goes forth from his mouth.
JOB.41.22	In Leviathan’s neck resides strength,
JOB.41.22	And dismay 
JOB.41.23	The folds of his flesh are joined together,
JOB.41.23	Firm on him and immobile [when he moves].
JOB.41.24	His heart is as hard as a stone,
JOB.41.24	Indeed, as solid as a lower millstone.
JOB.41.25	When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid;
JOB.41.25	Because of the crashing they are bewildered.
JOB.41.26	The sword that reaches him cannot avail,
JOB.41.26	Nor [does] the spear, the dart, or the javelin.
JOB.41.27	He considers iron as straw,
JOB.41.27	Bronze as rotten wood.
JOB.41.28	The arrow cannot make him flee;
JOB.41.28	Slingstones are treated as stubble by him.
JOB.41.29	Clubs [also] are regarded as stubble;
JOB.41.29	He laughs at the rushing 
JOB.41.30	His underparts are like sharp pieces of broken pottery;
JOB.41.30	He moves across 
JOB.41.31	He makes the deep water boil like a pot;
JOB.41.31	He makes the sea like a [foaming] pot of ointment.
JOB.41.32	Behind him he makes a shining wake;
JOB.41.32	One would think the deep to be gray-haired [with foam].
JOB.41.33	Upon earth there is nothing like him—no equal exists,
JOB.41.33	A creature made without fear.
JOB.41.34	He looks on everything that is high [without terror];
JOB.41.34	He is monarch over all the sons of pride. [And now, Job, 
JOB.42.1	Then Job answered the L
JOB.42.2	“I know that You can do all things,
JOB.42.2	And that no thought 
JOB.42.3	[You said to me] ‘Who is this that darkens 
JOB.42.3	Therefore [I now see] I have [rashly] uttered that which I did not understand,
JOB.42.3	Things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.
JOB.42.4	‘Hear, please, and I will speak;
JOB.42.4	I will ask You, and You instruct [and answer] me.’
JOB.42.5	I had heard of You [only] by the hearing of the ear,
JOB.42.5	But now my [spiritual] eye sees You.
JOB.42.6	Therefore I retract [my words and hate myself]
JOB.42.6	And I repent in dust and ashes.”
JOB.42.7	It came about that after the L
JOB.42.8	Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to My servant Job, and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves, and My servant Job will pray for you. For I will accept him [and his prayer] so that I may not deal with you 
JOB.42.9	So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the L
JOB.42.10	The L
JOB.42.11	Then all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before came to him, and they ate bread with him in his house; and they consoled him and comforted him over all the [distressing] adversities that the L
JOB.42.12	And the L
JOB.42.13	He had seven sons and three daughters. 
JOB.42.14	And he called the name of the first [daughter] Jemimah, and the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-happuch. 
JOB.42.15	In all the land there were found no women so fair as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers. 
JOB.42.16	After this, Job lived 140 years, and saw his sons and his grandsons, four generations. 
JOB.42.17	So Job died, an old man and full of days.
PSA.1.1	Nor stand in the path of sinners,
PSA.1.1	Nor sit [down to rest] in the seat of

PSA.1.2	And on His law [His precepts and teachings] he [habitually] meditates day and night.
PSA.1.3	And he will be like a tree 
PSA.1.3	Which yields its fruit in its season;
PSA.1.3	Its leaf does not wither;
PSA.1.3	And in whatever he does, he prospers [and comes to maturity].
PSA.1.4	The wicked [those who live in disobedience to God’s law] are not so,
PSA.1.4	But they are like the chaff [worthless and without substance] which the wind blows away.
PSA.1.5	Therefore the wicked will not stand [unpunished] in the judgment,
PSA.1.5	Nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
PSA.1.6	For the L
PSA.1.6	But the way of the wicked shall perish.
PSA.2.1	Why are the

PSA.2.2	And the rulers take counsel together
PSA.2.2	Against the L

PSA.2.3	And cast away their cords [of control] from us.”
PSA.2.4	He who sits [enthroned] in the heavens laughs [at their rebellion];
PSA.2.4	The [Sovereign] 
PSA.2.5	Then He will speak to them in His [profound] anger
PSA.2.5	And terrify them with His displeasure, saying,
PSA.2.6	“Yet as for Me, I have anointed 
PSA.2.6	Upon Zion, My holy mountain.”
PSA.2.7	“I will declare the decree of the L

PSA.2.8	Ask of Me, and I will assuredly give [You] the nations as Your inheritance,
PSA.2.8	And the ends of the earth as Your possession.
PSA.2.9	You shall break them with a rod of iron;
PSA.2.9	You shall shatter them [in pieces] like earthenware.’ ”
PSA.2.10	Now therefore, O kings, act wisely;

PSA.3.3	But You, O L

PSA.3.4	With my voice I was crying to the L

PSA.3.7	You have shattered the teeth of the wicked.
PSA.3.8	Salvation belongs to the L

PSA.4.8	In peace [and with a tranquil heart] I will both lie down and sleep,

PSA.5.2	For to You I pray.
PSA.5.3	In the morning, O L
PSA.5.3	In the morning I will prepare [a prayer and a sacrifice] for You and watch

PSA.5.7	At Your holy temple I will bow [obediently] in reverence for You.
PSA.5.8	O L
PSA.5.8	Make Your way straight (direct, right) before me.
PSA.5.9	For there is nothing trustworthy 
PSA.5.9	Their heart is destruction [just a treacherous chasm, a yawning gulf of lies].
PSA.5.9	Their throat is an open grave;

PSA.5.10	Hold them guilty, O God;
PSA.5.10	Let them fall by their own designs 
PSA.5.10	Cast them out because of the abundance of their transgressions,
PSA.5.10	For they are mutinous 
PSA.5.11	But let all who take refuge 
PSA.5.11	Let them ever sing for joy;
PSA.5.11	Because You cover 
PSA.5.11	Let those who love Your name be joyful 
PSA.5.12	For You, O L

PSA.6.6	I am weary with my groaning;
PSA.6.6	Every night I soak my bed with tears,
PSA.6.6	I drench my couch with my weeping.
PSA.6.7	My eye grows dim with grief;

PSA.7.1	Save me and rescue me from all those who pursue me,
PSA.7.2	So that my enemy will not tear me like a lion,
PSA.7.2	Dragging me away while there is no one to rescue [me].
PSA.7.3	O L
PSA.7.3	If there is injustice in my hands,
PSA.7.4	If I have done evil to him who was at peace with me,
PSA.7.4	Or without cause robbed him who was my enemy,
PSA.7.5	Let the enemy pursue me and overtake me;
PSA.7.5	And let him trample my life to the ground
PSA.7.5	And lay my honor in the dust. Selah.
PSA.7.6	Arise, O L
PSA.7.6	Lift up Yourself against the rage of my enemies;
PSA.7.6	Rise up for me; You have commanded judgment

PSA.7.8	The L
PSA.7.8	Judge me, O L
PSA.7.9	Oh, let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous [those in right standing with You];
PSA.7.9	For the righteous God tries the hearts and minds.
PSA.7.10	My shield 
PSA.7.10	Who saves the upright in heart.
PSA.7.11	God is a righteous judge,
PSA.7.11	And a God who is indignant every day.
PSA.7.12	If a man does not repent, God will sharpen His sword;
PSA.7.12	He has strung 
PSA.7.13	He has also prepared [other] deadly weapons for Himself;
PSA.7.13	He makes His arrows fiery shafts [aimed at the unrepentant].
PSA.7.14	Behold, the [wicked and irreverent] man is pregnant with sin,
PSA.7.14	And he conceives mischief and gives birth to lies.
PSA.7.15	He has dug a pit and hollowed it out,
PSA.7.15	And has fallen into the [very] pit which he made [as a trap].
PSA.7.16	His mischief will return on his own head,
PSA.7.16	And his violence will come down on the top of his head [like loose dirt].
PSA.7.17	I will give thanks to the L
PSA.7.17	And I will sing praise to the name of the L
PSA.8.1	O L
PSA.8.1	How majestic 
PSA.8.1	You have displayed Your splendor above the heavens.
PSA.8.2	Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babes You have established strength
PSA.8.2	Because of Your adversaries,
PSA.8.2	That You might silence the enemy 
PSA.8.3	When I see 
PSA.8.3	The moon and the stars, which You have established,
PSA.8.4	What is man that You are mindful of him,
PSA.8.4	And the son of [earthborn] man that You care for him?
PSA.8.5	Yet You have made him a little lower than 
PSA.8.5	And You have crowned him with glory and honor.
PSA.8.6	You made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands;
PSA.8.6	You have put all things under his feet,
PSA.8.7	All sheep and oxen,
PSA.8.7	And also the beasts of the field,
PSA.8.8	The birds of the air, and the fish of the sea,
PSA.8.8	Whatever passes through the paths of the seas.
PSA.8.9	O L
PSA.8.9	How majestic 
PSA.9.1	I will give thanks 
PSA.9.1	I will tell aloud all Your wonders 
PSA.9.2	I will rejoice and exult in you;
PSA.9.2	I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.
PSA.9.3	When my enemies turn back,
PSA.9.3	They stumble and perish before You.
PSA.9.4	For You have maintained my right and my cause;
PSA.9.4	You have sat on the throne judging righteously.
PSA.9.5	You have rebuked the nations, You have destroyed the wicked 
PSA.9.5	You have wiped out their name forever and ever.
PSA.9.6	The enemy has been cut off 
PSA.9.6	You have uprooted their cities;
PSA.9.6	The very memory of them has perished.
PSA.9.7	But the L

PSA.9.11	Declare among the peoples His [great and wondrous] deeds.
PSA.9.12	For He who avenges blood [unjustly shed] remembers them (His people);

PSA.9.13	Have mercy on me 
PSA.9.13	See how I am afflicted by those who hate me,
PSA.9.13	You who lift me up from the gates of death,
PSA.9.14	That I may tell aloud all Your praises,
PSA.9.14	That in the gates of the daughter of Zion (Jerusalem)
PSA.9.14	I may rejoice in Your salvation 
PSA.9.15	The nations have sunk down in the pit which they have made;
PSA.9.15	In the net which they hid, their own foot has been caught.
PSA.9.16	The L

PSA.31.12	I am forgotten like a dead man, out of mind;

PSA.35.4	Let those be turned back [in defeat] and humiliated who plot evil against me.
PSA.35.5	Let them be [blown away] like chaff before the wind [worthless, without substance],
PSA.35.5	With the angel of the L
PSA.35.6	Let their way be dark and slippery,
PSA.35.6	With the angel of the L
PSA.35.7	For without cause they hid their net for me;
PSA.35.7	Without cause they dug a pit [of destruction] for my life.
PSA.35.8	Let destruction come upon my enemy by surprise;
PSA.35.8	Let the net he hid for me catch him;
PSA.35.8	Into that very destruction let him fall.
PSA.35.9	Then my soul shall rejoice in the L

PSA.35.10	All my bones will say, “L
PSA.35.10	Who rescues the afflicted from him who is too strong for him [to resist alone],

PSA.35.11	Malicious witnesses rise up;
PSA.35.11	They ask me of things that I do not know.
PSA.35.12	They repay me evil for good,
PSA.35.12	To the sorrow of my soul.
PSA.35.13	But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth (mourning garment);
PSA.35.13	I humbled my soul with fasting,
PSA.35.13	And I prayed with my head bowed on my chest.
PSA.35.14	I behaved as if grieving for my friend or my brother;
PSA.35.14	I bowed down in mourning, as one who sorrows for his mother.
PSA.35.15	But in my stumbling they rejoiced and gathered together [against me];
PSA.35.15	The slanderers whom I did not know gathered against me;
PSA.35.15	They slandered 
PSA.35.16	Like godless jesters at a feast,

PSA.35.19	Nor let those who hate me without cause wink their eye [maliciously].
PSA.35.20	For they do not speak peace,
PSA.35.20	But they devise deceitful words [half-truths and lies] against those who are quiet in the land.
PSA.35.21	They open their mouths wide against me;
PSA.35.21	They say, “Aha, aha, our eyes have seen it!”
PSA.35.22	You have seen this, O L
PSA.35.22	O Lord, do not be far from me.
PSA.35.23	Wake Yourself up, and arise to my right
PSA.35.23	And to my cause, my God and my Lord.
PSA.35.24	Judge me, O L
PSA.35.24	And do not let them rejoice over me.
PSA.35.25	Do not let them say in their heart, “Aha, that is what we wanted!”
PSA.35.25	Do not let them say, “We have swallowed him up

PSA.35.26	Let those be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves over me.

PSA.36.1	There is no fear (dread) of God before his eyes.
PSA.36.2	For he flatters 
PSA.36.3	The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful;
PSA.36.3	He has ceased to be wise 
PSA.36.4	He plans wrongdoing on his bed;
PSA.36.4	He sets himself on a path that is not good;
PSA.36.4	He does not reject 
PSA.36.5	Your lovingkindness 
PSA.36.5	Your faithfulness [reaches] to the clouds.
PSA.36.6	Your righteousness is like the mountains of God,
PSA.36.6	Your judgments are like the great deep.
PSA.36.6	O L
PSA.36.7	How precious is Your lovingkindness, O God!
PSA.36.7	The children of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings.
PSA.36.8	They drink their fill of the abundance of Your house;
PSA.36.8	And You allow them to drink from the river of Your delights.
PSA.36.9	For with You is the fountain of life [the fountain of life-giving water];
PSA.36.9	In Your light we see light.
PSA.36.10	O continue Your lovingkindness to those who know You,
PSA.36.10	And Your righteousness (salvation) to the upright in heart.
PSA.36.11	Do not let the foot of the proud [person] overtake me,
PSA.36.11	And do not let the hand of the wicked drive me away.
PSA.36.12	There those who [are perverse and] do evil have fallen;
PSA.36.12	They have been thrust down and cannot rise.
PSA.37.1	Nor be envious toward wrongdoers;
PSA.37.2	For they will wither quickly like the grass,
PSA.37.2	And fade like the green herb.
PSA.37.3	Trust [rely on and have confidence] in the L
PSA.37.3	Dwell in the land and feed [securely] on His faithfulness.
PSA.37.4	Delight yourself in the L
PSA.37.4	And He will give you the desires 
PSA.37.5	Commit your way to the L
PSA.37.5	Trust in Him also and He will do it.
PSA.37.6	He will make your righteousness [your pursuit of right standing with God] like the light,
PSA.37.6	And your judgment like [the shining of] the noonday [sun].
PSA.37.7	Be still before the L
PSA.37.7	Do not fret (whine, agonize) because of him who prospers in his way,
PSA.37.7	Because of the man who carries out wicked schemes.
PSA.37.8	Cease from anger and abandon wrath;
PSA.37.8	Do not fret; 
PSA.37.9	For those who do evil will be cut off,
PSA.37.9	But those who wait for the L
PSA.37.10	For yet a little while and the wicked one will be gone [forever];
PSA.37.10	Though you look carefully where he used to be, he will not be [found].
PSA.37.11	But the humble will [at last] inherit the land
PSA.37.11	And will delight themselves in abundant prosperity 
PSA.37.12	The wicked plots against the righteous
PSA.37.12	And gnashes at him with his teeth.
PSA.37.13	The Lord laughs at him [the wicked one—the one who oppresses the righteous],
PSA.37.13	For He sees that his day [of defeat] is coming.
PSA.37.14	The wicked have drawn the sword and bent their bow
PSA.37.14	To cast down the afflicted and the needy,
PSA.37.14	To slaughter those who are upright in conduct [those with personal integrity and godly character].
PSA.37.15	The sword [of the ungodly] will enter their own heart,
PSA.37.15	And their bow will be broken.
PSA.37.16	Better is the little of the righteous [who seek the will of God]
PSA.37.16	Than the abundance (riches) of many wicked (godless).
PSA.37.17	For the arms of the wicked will be broken,
PSA.37.17	But the L
PSA.37.18	The L
PSA.37.18	And their inheritance will continue forever.
PSA.37.19	They will not be 
PSA.37.19	And in the days of famine they will have plenty 
PSA.37.20	But the wicked (ungodly) will perish,
PSA.37.20	And the enemies of the L
PSA.37.20	They vanish—like smoke they vanish away.
PSA.37.21	The wicked borrows and does not pay back,
PSA.37.21	But the righteous is gracious 
PSA.37.22	For those blessed by God will [at last] inherit the land,
PSA.37.22	But those cursed by Him will be cut off.
PSA.37.23	The steps of a [good and righteous] man are directed 
PSA.37.23	And He delights in his way [and blesses his path].
PSA.37.24	When he falls, he will not be hurled down,
PSA.37.24	Because the L
PSA.37.25	I have been young and now I am old,
PSA.37.25	Yet I have not seen the righteous (those in right standing with God) abandoned
PSA.37.25	Or his descendants pleading for bread.
PSA.37.26	All day long he is gracious and lends,
PSA.37.26	And his descendants are a blessing.
PSA.37.27	Depart from evil and do good;
PSA.37.27	And you will dwell [securely in the land] forever.
PSA.37.28	For the L
PSA.37.28	And does not abandon His saints (faithful ones);
PSA.37.28	They are preserved forever,
PSA.37.28	But the descendants of the wicked will [in time] be cut off.
PSA.37.29	The righteous will inherit the land
PSA.37.29	And live in it forever.
PSA.37.30	The mouth of the righteous proclaims wisdom,
PSA.37.30	And his tongue speaks justice 
PSA.37.31	The law of his God is in his heart;
PSA.37.31	Not one of his steps will slip.
PSA.37.32	The wicked lies in wait for the righteous
PSA.37.32	And seeks to kill him.
PSA.37.33	The L
PSA.37.33	Or let him be condemned when he is judged.
PSA.37.34	Wait for 
PSA.37.34	And He will exalt you to inherit the land;
PSA.37.34	[In the end] when the wicked are cut off, you will see it.
PSA.37.35	I have seen a wicked, violent man [with great power]
PSA.37.35	Spreading 
PSA.37.36	Yet he passed away, and lo, he was no more;
PSA.37.36	I sought him, but he could not be found.
PSA.37.37	Mark the blameless man [who is spiritually complete], and behold the upright [who walks in moral integrity];
PSA.37.37	There is a [good] future for the man of peace [because a life of honor blesses one’s descendants].
PSA.37.38	As for transgressors, they will be completely destroyed;
PSA.37.38	The future of the wicked will be cut off.
PSA.37.39	But the salvation of the righteous is from the L
PSA.37.39	He is their refuge 
PSA.37.40	The L
PSA.37.40	He rescues them from the wicked and saves them,
PSA.37.40	Because they take refuge in Him.
PSA.38.1	O L
PSA.38.1	Nor discipline me in Your burning anger.
PSA.38.2	For Your arrows have sunk into me 
PSA.38.2	And Your hand has pressed down on me 
PSA.38.3	There is no soundness in my flesh because of Your indignation;
PSA.38.3	There is no health in my bones because of my sin.
PSA.38.4	For my iniquities have gone over my head [like the waves of a flood];
PSA.38.4	As a heavy burden they weigh too much for me.
PSA.38.5	My wounds are loathsome and foul
PSA.38.5	Because of my foolishness.
PSA.38.6	I am bent over and greatly bowed down;
PSA.38.6	I go about mourning all day long.
PSA.38.7	For my sides are filled with burning,
PSA.38.7	And there is no health in my flesh.
PSA.38.8	I am numb and greatly bruised [deadly cold and completely worn out];
PSA.38.8	I groan because of the disquiet 
PSA.38.9	Lord, all my desire is before You;
PSA.38.9	And my sighing is not hidden from You.
PSA.38.10	My heart throbs violently, my strength fails me;
PSA.38.10	And as for the light of my eyes, even that has also gone from me.
PSA.38.11	My loved ones and my friends stand aloof from my plague;
PSA.38.11	And my neighbors stand far away.
PSA.38.12	Those who seek my life lay snares 
PSA.38.12	And those who seek to injure me threaten mischievous things 
PSA.38.12	They devise treachery all the day long.
PSA.38.13	But I, like a deaf man, do not hear;
PSA.38.13	I am like a mute man who does not open his mouth.
PSA.38.14	Yes, I am like a man who does not hear,
PSA.38.14	In whose mouth are no arguments.
PSA.38.15	For in You, O L
PSA.38.15	You will answer, O Lord my God.
PSA.38.16	For I pray, “May they not rejoice over me,
PSA.38.16	Who, when my foot slips, would boast against me.”
PSA.38.17	For I am ready to fall;
PSA.38.17	My sorrow is continually before me.
PSA.38.18	For I do confess my guilt 
PSA.38.18	I am filled with anxiety because of my sin.
PSA.38.19	But my [numerous] enemies are vigorous and strong,
PSA.38.19	And those who hate me without cause are many.
PSA.38.20	They repay evil for good, they attack 
PSA.38.20	Because I follow what is good.
PSA.38.21	Do not abandon me, O L
PSA.38.21	O my God, do not be far from me.
PSA.38.22	Make haste to help me,
PSA.38.22	O Lord, my Salvation.
PSA.39.1	I said, “I will guard my ways
PSA.39.1	That I may not sin with my tongue;
PSA.39.1	I will muzzle my mouth
PSA.39.1	While the wicked are in my presence.”
PSA.39.2	I was mute and silent [before my enemies],
PSA.39.2	I refrained 
PSA.39.2	And my 
PSA.39.3	My heart was hot within me.
PSA.39.3	While I was musing the fire burned;
PSA.39.3	Then I spoke with my tongue:
PSA.39.4	“L
PSA.39.4	And [to appreciate] the extent of my days;
PSA.39.4	Let me know how frail I am [how transient is my stay here].
PSA.39.5	Behold, You have made my days as [short as] hand widths,
PSA.39.5	And my lifetime is as nothing in Your sight.
PSA.39.5	Surely every man at his best is a mere breath [a wisp of smoke, a vapor that vanishes]! Selah.
PSA.39.6	Surely every man walks around like a shadow [in a charade];
PSA.39.6	Surely they make an uproar for nothing;
PSA.39.6	Each one builds up 
PSA.39.7	“And now, Lord, for what do I expectantly wait?
PSA.39.7	My hope [my confident expectation] is in You.
PSA.39.8	Save me from all my transgressions;
PSA.39.8	Do not make me the scorn 
PSA.39.9	I am mute, I do not open my mouth,
PSA.39.9	Because it is You who has done it.
PSA.39.10	Remove Your plague from me;
PSA.39.10	I am wasting away because of the conflict 
PSA.39.11	With rebukes You discipline man for sin;
PSA.39.11	You consume like a moth what is precious to him;
PSA.39.11	Surely every man is a mere breath [a wisp of smoke, a vapor that vanishes]. Selah.
PSA.39.12	“Hear my prayer, O L
PSA.39.12	Do not be silent at my tears;
PSA.39.12	For I am Your temporary guest,
PSA.39.12	A sojourner like all my fathers.
PSA.39.13	O look away from me, that I may smile 
PSA.39.13	Before I depart and am no more.”
PSA.40.1	I waited patiently 
PSA.40.1	And He inclined to me and heard my cry.
PSA.40.2	He brought me up out of a horrible pit [of tumult and of destruction], out of the miry clay,
PSA.40.2	And He set my feet upon a rock, steadying my footsteps 
PSA.40.3	He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God;
PSA.40.3	Many will see and fear [with great reverence]
PSA.40.3	And will trust confidently in the L
PSA.40.4	Blessed [fortunate, prosperous, and favored by God] is the man who makes the L
PSA.40.4	And does not regard the proud nor those who lapse into lies.
PSA.40.5	Many, O L
PSA.40.5	And Your thoughts toward us;
PSA.40.5	There is none to compare with You.
PSA.40.5	If I would declare and speak of 
PSA.40.5	They would be too many to count.
PSA.40.6	Sacrifice and meal offering You do not desire, 
PSA.40.6	You have opened my ears 
PSA.40.6	Burnt offerings and sin offerings You do not require.
PSA.40.7	Then I said, “Behold, I come [to the throne];
PSA.40.7	In the scroll of the book it is written of me.
PSA.40.8	I delight to do Your will, O my God;
PSA.40.8	Your law is within my heart.”
PSA.40.9	I have proclaimed good news of righteousness [and the joy that comes from obedience to You] in the great assembly;
PSA.40.9	Behold, I will not restrain my lips [from proclaiming Your righteousness],
PSA.40.9	As You know, O L
PSA.40.10	I have not concealed Your righteousness within my heart;
PSA.40.10	I have proclaimed Your faithfulness and Your salvation.
PSA.40.10	I have not concealed Your lovingkindness and Your truth from the great assembly.
PSA.40.11	Do not withhold Your compassion 
PSA.40.11	Your lovingkindness and Your truth will continually preserve me.
PSA.40.12	For innumerable evils have encompassed me;
PSA.40.12	My sins have overtaken me, so that I am not able to see.
PSA.40.12	They are more numerous than the hairs of my head,
PSA.40.12	And my heart has failed me.
PSA.40.13	Be pleased, O L
PSA.40.13	O L
PSA.40.14	Let those be ashamed and humiliated together
PSA.40.14	Who seek my life to destroy it;
PSA.40.14	Let those be turned back [in defeat] and dishonored
PSA.40.14	Who delight in my hurt.
PSA.40.15	Let those be appalled 
PSA.40.15	Who say to me, “Aha, aha [rejoicing in my misfortune]!”
PSA.40.16	Let all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You;
PSA.40.16	Let those who love Your salvation say continually,
PSA.40.16	“The L
PSA.40.17	Even though I am afflicted and needy,
PSA.40.17	Still the Lord takes thought 
PSA.40.17	You are my help and my rescuer.
PSA.40.17	O my God, do not delay.
PSA.41.1	Blessed [by God’s grace and compassion] is he who considers the helpless;
PSA.41.1	The L
PSA.41.2	The L
PSA.41.2	And he will be called blessed in the land;
PSA.41.2	You do not hand him over to the desire of his enemies.
PSA.41.3	The L
PSA.41.3	In his illness, You will restore him to health.
PSA.41.4	As for me, I said, “O L
PSA.41.4	Heal my soul, for I have sinned against You.”
PSA.41.5	My enemies speak evil of me, 
PSA.41.5	“When will he die and his name perish?”
PSA.41.6	And when one comes to see me, he speaks empty words,
PSA.41.6	While his heart gathers malicious gossip [against me];
PSA.41.6	When he goes away, he tells it [everywhere].
PSA.41.7	All who hate me whisper together about me;
PSA.41.7	Against me they devise my hurt [imagining the worst for me], 
PSA.41.8	“A wicked thing is poured out upon him 
PSA.41.8	And when he lies down, he will not rise up again.”
PSA.41.9	Even my own close friend in whom I trusted,
PSA.41.9	Who ate my bread,
PSA.41.9	Has lifted up his heel against me [betraying me].
PSA.41.10	But You, O L
PSA.41.10	So that I may repay them.
PSA.41.11	By this I know that You favor 
PSA.41.11	Because my enemy does not shout in triumph over me.
PSA.41.12	As for me, You uphold me in my integrity,
PSA.41.12	And You set me in Your presence forever.
PSA.41.13	Blessed be the L
PSA.41.13	From everlasting to everlasting [from this age to the next, and forever].
PSA.41.13	Amen and Amen (so be it).
PSA.42.1	As the deer pants [longingly] for the water brooks,
PSA.42.1	So my 
PSA.42.2	My soul (my life, my inner self) thirsts for God, for the living God.
PSA.42.2	When will I come and see the face of God?
PSA.42.3	My tears have been my food day and night,
PSA.42.3	While they say to me all day long, “Where is your God?”
PSA.42.4	These things I [vividly] remember as I pour out my soul;
PSA.42.4	How I used to go along before the great crowd of people and lead them in procession to the house of God [like a choirmaster before his singers, timing the steps to the music and the chant of the song],
PSA.42.4	With the voice of joy and thanksgiving, a great crowd keeping a festival.
PSA.42.5	Why are you in despair, O my soul?
PSA.42.5	And why have you become restless 
PSA.42.5	Hope in God 
PSA.42.5	For the help of His presence.
PSA.42.6	O my God, my soul is in despair within me [the burden more than I can bear];
PSA.42.6	Therefore I will [fervently] remember You from the land of the Jordan
PSA.42.6	And the peaks of [Mount] Hermon, from Mount Mizar.
PSA.42.7	Deep calls to deep at the [thundering] sound of Your waterfalls;
PSA.42.7	All Your breakers and Your waves have rolled over me.
PSA.42.8	Yet the L
PSA.42.8	And in the night His song will be with me,
PSA.42.8	A prayer to the God of my life.
PSA.42.9	I will say to God my rock, “Why have You forgotten me?
PSA.42.9	Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?”
PSA.42.10	As a crushing of my bones [with a sword], my adversaries taunt me,
PSA.42.10	While they say continually to me, “Where is your God?”
PSA.42.11	Why are you in despair, O my soul?
PSA.42.11	Why have you become restless 
PSA.42.11	Hope in God 
PSA.42.11	The 
PSA.43.1	Judge 
PSA.43.1	O rescue me from the deceitful and unjust man!
PSA.43.2	For You are the God of my strength [my stronghold—in whom I take refuge]; why have You rejected me?
PSA.43.2	Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
PSA.43.3	O send out Your light and Your truth, let them lead me;
PSA.43.3	Let them bring me to Your holy hill
PSA.43.3	And to Your dwelling places.
PSA.43.4	Then I will go to the altar of God,
PSA.43.4	To God, my exceeding joy;
PSA.43.4	With the lyre I will praise You, O God, my God!
PSA.43.5	Why are you in despair, O my soul?
PSA.43.5	And why are you restless 
PSA.43.5	Hope in God 
PSA.43.5	The 
PSA.44.1	We have heard with our ears, O God,
PSA.44.1	Our fathers have told us
PSA.44.1	The work You did in their days,
PSA.44.1	In the days of old.
PSA.44.2	You drove out the [pagan] nations with Your own hand;
PSA.44.2	Then you planted 
PSA.44.2	[It was by Your power that] You uprooted the [pagan] peoples,
PSA.44.2	Then You spread them abroad.
PSA.44.3	For our fathers did not possess the land [of Canaan] by their own sword,
PSA.44.3	Nor did their own arm save them,
PSA.44.3	But Your right hand and Your arm and the light of Your presence,
PSA.44.3	Because You favored 
PSA.44.4	You are my King, O God;
PSA.44.4	Command victories 
PSA.44.5	Through You we will gore our enemies [like a bull];
PSA.44.5	Through Your name we will trample down those who rise up against us.
PSA.44.6	For I will not trust in my bow,
PSA.44.6	Nor will my sword save me.
PSA.44.7	But You have saved us from our enemies,
PSA.44.7	And You have put them to shame 
PSA.44.8	In God we have boasted all the day long,
PSA.44.8	And we will praise 
PSA.44.9	But now You have rejected us and brought us to dishonor,
PSA.44.9	And You do not go out with our armies [to lead us to victory].
PSA.44.10	You make us turn back from the enemy,
PSA.44.10	And those who hate us have taken spoil for themselves.
PSA.44.11	You have made us like sheep to be eaten [as mutton]
PSA.44.11	And have scattered us [in exile] among the nations.
PSA.44.12	You sell Your people cheaply,
PSA.44.12	And have not increased Your wealth by their sale.
PSA.44.13	You have made us the reproach 
PSA.44.13	A scoffing and a derision to those around us.
PSA.44.14	You make us a byword among the nations,
PSA.44.14	A 
PSA.44.15	My dishonor is before me all day long,
PSA.44.15	And humiliation has covered my face,
PSA.44.16	Because of the voice of the taunter and reviler,
PSA.44.16	Because of the presence of the enemy and the avenger.
PSA.44.17	All this has come upon us, yet we have not forgotten You,
PSA.44.17	Nor have we been false to Your covenant [which You made with our fathers].
PSA.44.18	Our heart has not turned back,
PSA.44.18	Nor have our steps wandered from Your path,
PSA.44.19	Yet You have [distressingly] crushed us in the place of jackals
PSA.44.19	And covered us with [the deep darkness of] the shadow of death.
PSA.44.20	If we had forgotten the name of our God
PSA.44.20	Or stretched out our hands to a strange god,
PSA.44.21	Would not God discover this?
PSA.44.21	For He knows the secrets of the heart.
PSA.44.22	We are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.
PSA.44.23	Awake! Why do You sleep, O Lord?
PSA.44.23	Awaken, do not reject us forever.
PSA.44.24	Why do You hide Your face
PSA.44.24	And forget our affliction and our oppression?
PSA.44.25	For our life has melted away into the dust;
PSA.44.25	Our body clings to the ground.
PSA.44.26	Rise up! Come be our help,
PSA.44.26	And ransom us for the sake of Your steadfast love.
PSA.45.1	I address my psalm to the King.
PSA.45.1	My tongue is like the pen of a skillful writer.
PSA.45.2	You are fairer than the sons of men;
PSA.45.2	Graciousness is poured upon Your lips;
PSA.45.2	Therefore God has blessed You forever.
PSA.45.3	Strap Your sword on 
PSA.45.3	In Your splendor and Your majesty!
PSA.45.4	And in Your majesty ride on triumphantly
PSA.45.4	For the cause of truth and humility and righteousness;
PSA.45.4	Let Your right hand guide You to awesome things.
PSA.45.5	Your arrows are sharp;
PSA.45.5	The peoples (nations) fall under You;
PSA.45.6	The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom.
PSA.45.7	You have loved righteousness (virtue, morality, justice) and hated wickedness;
PSA.45.7	Therefore God, your God, has anointed You
PSA.45.7	Above Your companions with the oil of jubilation.
PSA.45.8	All Your garments are 
PSA.45.8	From ivory palaces stringed instruments have made You glad.
PSA.45.9	Kings’ daughters are among Your noble ladies;
PSA.45.9	At Your right hand stands the queen in gold from Ophir.
PSA.45.10	Hear, O daughter, consider and incline your ear [to my instruction]:
PSA.45.10	Forget your people and your father’s house;
PSA.45.11	Then the King will desire your beauty;
PSA.45.11	Because He is your Lord, bow down 
PSA.45.12	The daughter of Tyre will come with a gift;
PSA.45.12	The rich among the people will seek your favor.
PSA.45.13	Glorious is the King’s daughter within [the palace];
PSA.45.13	Her robe is interwoven with gold.
PSA.45.14	She will be brought to the King in embroidered garments;
PSA.45.14	The virgins, her companions who follow her,
PSA.45.14	Will be brought to You.
PSA.45.15	With gladness and rejoicing will they be led;
PSA.45.15	They will enter into the King’s palace.
PSA.45.16	In place of your fathers will be 
PSA.45.16	You shall make princes in all the land.
PSA.45.17	I will make Your name to be remembered in all generations;
PSA.45.17	Therefore the peoples will praise 
PSA.46.1	God is our refuge and strength [mighty and impenetrable],
PSA.46.1	A very present 
PSA.46.2	Therefore we will not fear, though the earth should change
PSA.46.2	And though the mountains be shaken 
PSA.46.3	Though its waters roar and foam,
PSA.46.3	Though the mountains tremble at its roaring. Selah.
PSA.46.4	There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,
PSA.46.4	The holy dwelling places of the Most High.
PSA.46.5	God is in the midst of her [His city], she will not be moved;
PSA.46.5	God will help her when the morning dawns.
PSA.46.6	The nations made an uproar, the kingdoms tottered 
PSA.46.6	He raised His voice, the earth melted.
PSA.46.7	The L
PSA.46.7	The God of Jacob is our stronghold [our refuge, our high tower]. Selah.
PSA.46.8	Come, behold the works of the L
PSA.46.8	Who has brought desolations 
PSA.46.9	He makes wars to cease to the end of the earth;
PSA.46.9	He breaks the bow into pieces and snaps the spear in two;
PSA.46.9	He burns the chariots with fire.
PSA.46.10	“Be still and know (recognize, understand) that I am God.
PSA.46.10	I will be exalted among the nations! I will be exalted in the earth.”
PSA.46.11	The L
PSA.46.11	The God of Jacob is our stronghold [our refuge, our high tower]. Selah.
PSA.47.1	O clap your hands, all you people;
PSA.47.1	Shout to God with the voice of triumph 
PSA.47.2	For the L
PSA.47.2	He is a great King over all the earth.
PSA.47.3	He subdues peoples under us
PSA.47.3	And nations under our feet.
PSA.47.4	He chooses our inheritance for us,
PSA.47.4	The glory 
PSA.47.5	God has ascended amid shouting,
PSA.47.5	The L
PSA.47.6	Sing praises to God, sing praises;
PSA.47.6	Sing praises to our King, sing praises.
PSA.47.7	For God is the King of all the earth;
PSA.47.7	Sing praises in a skillful psalm 
PSA.47.8	God reigns over the nations;
PSA.47.8	God sits on His holy throne.
PSA.47.9	The princes of the people have gathered together as the people of the God of Abraham,
PSA.47.9	For the shields of the earth belong to God;
PSA.47.9	He is highly exalted.
PSA.48.1	Great is the L
PSA.48.1	In the city of our God, His holy mountain.
PSA.48.2	Fair 
PSA.48.2	Is Mount Zion [the City of David] in the far north,
PSA.48.2	The city of the great King.
PSA.48.3	God, in her palaces,
PSA.48.3	Has made Himself known as a stronghold.
PSA.48.4	For, lo, the kings assembled themselves,
PSA.48.4	They [came and] passed by together.
PSA.48.5	They saw it, then they were amazed;
PSA.48.5	They were stricken with terror, they fled in alarm.
PSA.48.6	Panic seized them there,
PSA.48.6	And pain, as that of a woman in childbirth.
PSA.48.7	With the east wind
PSA.48.7	You shattered the ships of Tarshish.
PSA.48.8	As we have heard, so have we seen
PSA.48.8	In the city of the L
PSA.48.8	God will establish her forever. Selah.
PSA.48.9	We have thought of Your lovingkindness, O God,
PSA.48.9	In the midst of Your temple.
PSA.48.10	As is Your name, O God,
PSA.48.10	So is Your praise to the ends of the earth;
PSA.48.10	Your right hand is full of righteousness (rightness, justice).
PSA.48.11	Let Mount Zion be glad,
PSA.48.11	Let the daughters of Judah rejoice
PSA.48.11	Because of Your [righteous] judgments.
PSA.48.12	Walk about Zion, go all around her;
PSA.48.12	Count her towers,
PSA.48.13	Consider her ramparts,
PSA.48.13	Go through her palaces,
PSA.48.13	That you may tell the next generation [about her glory].
PSA.48.14	For this is God,
PSA.48.14	Our God forever and ever;
PSA.48.14	He will be our guide even until death.
PSA.49.1	Hear this, all peoples;
PSA.49.1	Listen carefully, all inhabitants of the world,
PSA.49.2	Both low and high,
PSA.49.2	Rich and poor together:
PSA.49.3	My mouth will speak wisdom,
PSA.49.3	And the meditation of my heart will be understanding.
PSA.49.4	I will incline my ear 
PSA.49.4	On the lyre I will unfold my riddle.
PSA.49.5	Why should I fear in the days of evil,
PSA.49.5	When the wickedness of those who would betray me surrounds me [on every side],
PSA.49.6	Even those who trust in 
PSA.49.6	And boast of the abundance of their riches?
PSA.49.7	None of them can by any means redeem [either himself or] his brother,
PSA.49.7	Nor give to God a ransom for him—
PSA.49.8	For the ransom of his soul is too costly,
PSA.49.8	And he should cease 
PSA.49.9	So that he should live on eternally,
PSA.49.9	That he should never see the pit (grave) 
PSA.49.10	For he sees 
PSA.49.10	The fool and the stupid alike perish
PSA.49.10	And leave their wealth to others.
PSA.49.11	Their inward thought is that their houses will continue forever,
PSA.49.11	And their dwelling places to all generations;
PSA.49.11	They have named their lands after their own names [ignoring God].
PSA.49.12	But man, with all his [self] honor 
PSA.49.12	He is like the beasts that perish.
PSA.49.13	This is the fate of those who are foolishly confident,
PSA.49.13	And of those after them who approve [and are influenced by] their words. Selah.
PSA.49.14	Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead);
PSA.49.14	Death will be their shepherd;
PSA.49.14	And the upright shall rule over them in the morning,
PSA.49.14	And their form 
PSA.49.14	So that they have no dwelling [on earth].
PSA.49.15	But God will redeem my life from the power of Sheol,
PSA.49.15	For He will receive me. Selah.
PSA.49.16	Be not afraid when [an ungodly] man becomes rich,
PSA.49.16	When the wealth 
PSA.49.17	For when he dies he will carry nothing away;
PSA.49.17	His glory will not descend after him.
PSA.49.18	Though while he lives he counts himself happy 
PSA.49.18	And though people praise you when you do well for yourself—
PSA.49.19	He shall go to the generation of his fathers;
PSA.49.19	They shall never again see the light.
PSA.49.20	A man [who is held] in honor,
PSA.49.20	Yet who lacks [spiritual] understanding 
PSA.50.1	The mighty One, God, the L
PSA.50.1	And summoned the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting [from east to west].
PSA.50.2	Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,
PSA.50.2	God has shone forth.
PSA.50.3	May our God come and not keep silent;
PSA.50.3	Fire devours before Him,
PSA.50.3	And around Him a mighty tempest rages.
PSA.50.4	He summons the heavens above,
PSA.50.4	And the earth, to judge His people:
PSA.50.5	“Gather My godly ones to Me,
PSA.50.5	Those who have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice.”
PSA.50.6	And the heavens declare His righteousness,
PSA.50.6	For God Himself is judge. Selah.
PSA.50.7	“Hear, O My people, and I will speak;
PSA.50.7	O Israel, I will testify against you:
PSA.50.7	I am God, your God.
PSA.50.8	I do not reprove you for your sacrifices;
PSA.50.8	Your burnt offerings are continually before Me.
PSA.50.9	I will accept no young bull from your house
PSA.50.9	Nor male goat from your folds.
PSA.50.10	For every beast of the forest is Mine,
PSA.50.10	And the cattle on a thousand hills.
PSA.50.11	I know every bird of the mountains,
PSA.50.11	And everything that moves in the field is 
PSA.50.12	If I were hungry, I would not tell you,
PSA.50.12	For the world and all it contains are Mine.
PSA.50.13	Shall I eat the flesh of bulls
PSA.50.13	Or drink the blood of male goats?
PSA.50.14	Offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving
PSA.50.14	And pay your vows to the Most High;
PSA.50.15	Call on Me in the day of trouble;
PSA.50.15	I will rescue you, and you shall honor 
PSA.50.16	But to the wicked God says:
PSA.50.16	“What right have you to recite My statutes
PSA.50.16	Or to take My covenant on your lips?
PSA.50.17	For you hate instruction 
PSA.50.17	And cast My words behind you [discarding them].
PSA.50.18	When you see a thief, you are pleased with him 
PSA.50.18	And you associate with adulterers.
PSA.50.19	You give your mouth to evil
PSA.50.19	And your tongue frames deceit.
PSA.50.20	You sit and speak against your brother;
PSA.50.20	You slander your own mother’s son.
PSA.50.21	These things you have done and I kept silent;
PSA.50.21	You thought that I was just like you.
PSA.50.21	Now I will reprimand 
PSA.50.22	“Now consider this, you who forget God,
PSA.50.22	Or I will tear you in pieces, and there will be no one to rescue [you].
PSA.50.23	He who offers a sacrifice of praise 
PSA.50.23	And to him who orders his way rightly [who follows the way that I show him],
PSA.50.23	I shall show the salvation of God.”
PSA.51.1	Have mercy on me, O God, according to Your lovingkindness;
PSA.51.1	According to the greatness of Your compassion blot out my transgressions.
PSA.51.2	Wash me thoroughly from my wickedness 
PSA.51.2	And cleanse me from my sin.
PSA.51.3	For I am conscious of my transgressions 
PSA.51.3	My sin is always before me.
PSA.51.4	Against You, You only, have I sinned
PSA.51.4	And done that which is evil in Your sight,
PSA.51.4	So that You are justified when You speak [Your sentence]
PSA.51.4	And faultless in Your judgment.
PSA.51.5	I was brought forth in [a state of] wickedness;
PSA.51.5	In sin my mother conceived me [and from my beginning I, too, was sinful].
PSA.51.6	Behold, You desire truth in the innermost being,
PSA.51.6	And in the hidden part [of my heart] You will make me know wisdom.
PSA.51.7	Purify me with 
PSA.51.7	Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
PSA.51.8	Make me hear joy and gladness 
PSA.51.8	Let the bones which You have broken rejoice.
PSA.51.9	Hide Your face from my sins
PSA.51.9	And blot out all my iniquities.
PSA.51.10	Create in me a clean heart, O God,
PSA.51.10	And renew a right 
PSA.51.11	Do not cast me away from Your presence
PSA.51.11	And do not take Your Holy Spirit from me.
PSA.51.12	Restore to me the joy of Your salvation
PSA.51.12	And sustain me with a willing spirit.
PSA.51.13	Then I will teach transgressors Your ways,
PSA.51.13	And sinners shall be converted 
PSA.51.14	Rescue me from bloodguiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation;
PSA.51.14	Then my tongue will sing joyfully of Your righteousness 
PSA.51.15	O Lord, open my lips,
PSA.51.15	That my mouth may declare Your praise.
PSA.51.16	For You do not delight in sacrifice, or else I would give it;
PSA.51.16	You are not pleased with burnt offering.
PSA.51.17	My [only] sacrifice [acceptable] to God is a broken spirit;
PSA.51.17	A broken and contrite heart [broken with sorrow for sin, thoroughly penitent], such, O God, You will not despise.
PSA.51.18	By Your favor do good to Zion;
PSA.51.18	May You rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.
PSA.51.19	Then will You delight in the sacrifices of righteousness,
PSA.51.19	In burnt offering and whole burnt offering;
PSA.51.19	Then young bulls will be offered on Your altar.
PSA.52.1	Why do you boast of evil, O mighty man?
PSA.52.1	The lovingkindness of God 
PSA.52.2	Your tongue devises destruction,
PSA.52.2	Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
PSA.52.3	You love evil more than good,
PSA.52.3	And falsehood more than speaking what is right. Selah.
PSA.52.4	You love all words that devour,
PSA.52.4	O deceitful tongue.
PSA.52.5	But God will break you down forever;
PSA.52.5	He will take you away and tear you away from your tent,
PSA.52.5	And uproot you from the land of the living. Selah.
PSA.52.6	The righteous will see it and fear,
PSA.52.6	And will [scoffingly] laugh, 
PSA.52.7	“Look, [this is] the man who would not make God his strength [his stronghold and fortress],
PSA.52.7	But trusted in the abundance of his riches,
PSA.52.7	Taking refuge in his wealth.”
PSA.52.8	But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in the house of God;
PSA.52.8	I trust [confidently] in the lovingkindness of God forever and ever.
PSA.52.9	I will thank You forever, because You have done it, [You have rescued me and kept me safe].
PSA.52.9	I will wait on Your name, for it is good, in the presence of Your godly ones.
PSA.53.1	The [empty-headed] fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.”
PSA.53.1	They are corrupt 
PSA.53.1	There is no one who does good.
PSA.53.2	God has looked down from heaven upon the children of men
PSA.53.2	To see if there is anyone who understands,
PSA.53.2	Who seeks after God [who requires Him, who longs for Him as essential to life].
PSA.53.3	Every one of them has turned aside 
PSA.53.3	Together they have become filthy 
PSA.53.3	There is no one who does good, no, not even one.
PSA.53.4	Have workers of wickedness no knowledge 
PSA.53.4	They eat up My people 
PSA.53.4	And have not called upon God.
PSA.53.5	There they were, in great terror 
PSA.53.5	For God scattered the bones of him who besieged you;
PSA.53.5	You have put them to shame, because God has rejected them.
PSA.53.6	Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!
PSA.53.6	When God restores [the fortunes of] His people,
PSA.53.6	Let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.
PSA.54.1	Save me, O God, by Your name;
PSA.54.1	And vindicate me by Your [wondrous] power.
PSA.54.2	Hear my prayer, O God;
PSA.54.2	Listen to the words of my mouth.
PSA.54.3	For strangers have risen against me
PSA.54.3	And violent men have sought my life;
PSA.54.3	They have not set God before them. Selah.
PSA.54.4	Behold, God is my helper 
PSA.54.4	The Lord is the sustainer of my soul [my upholder].
PSA.54.5	He will pay back the evil to my enemies;
PSA.54.5	In Your faithfulness destroy them.
PSA.54.6	With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to You;
PSA.54.6	I will give thanks 
PSA.54.7	For He has rescued me from every trouble,
PSA.54.7	And my eye has looked 
PSA.55.1	Listen to my prayer, O God,
PSA.55.1	And do not hide Yourself from my plea.
PSA.55.2	Listen to me and answer me;
PSA.55.2	I am restless 
PSA.55.3	Because of the voice of the enemy,
PSA.55.3	Because of the pressure of the wicked;
PSA.55.3	For they bring down trouble on me,
PSA.55.3	And in anger they persecute me.
PSA.55.4	My heart is in anguish within me,
PSA.55.4	And the terrors of death have fallen upon me.
PSA.55.5	Fear and trembling have come upon me;
PSA.55.5	Horror has overwhelmed me.
PSA.55.6	And I say, “Oh, that I had wings like a dove!
PSA.55.6	I would fly away and be at rest.
PSA.55.7	I would wander far away,
PSA.55.7	I would lodge in the [peace of the] wilderness. Selah.
PSA.55.8	I would hurry to my refuge [my tranquil shelter far away]
PSA.55.8	From the stormy wind 
PSA.55.9	For I have seen violence and strife in the city.
PSA.55.10	Day and night they go around her walls;
PSA.55.10	Wickedness and mischief are in her midst.
PSA.55.11	Destruction is within her;
PSA.55.11	Oppression and deceit do not depart from her streets 
PSA.55.12	For it is not an enemy who taunts me—
PSA.55.12	Then I could bear it;
PSA.55.12	Nor is it one who has hated me who insolently exalts himself against me—
PSA.55.12	Then I could hide from him.
PSA.55.13	But it is you, a man my equal 
PSA.55.13	My companion and my familiar friend;
PSA.55.14	We who had sweet 
PSA.55.14	Who walked to the house of God in company.
PSA.55.15	Let death come deceitfully upon them;
PSA.55.15	Let them go down alive to Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead),
PSA.55.15	For evil [of every kind] is in their dwelling 
PSA.55.16	As for me, I shall call upon God,
PSA.55.16	And the L
PSA.55.17	Evening and morning and at noon I will complain and murmur,
PSA.55.17	And He will hear my voice.
PSA.55.18	He has redeemed my life in peace from the battle that was against me,
PSA.55.18	For there were many against me.
PSA.55.19	God will hear and humble them,
PSA.55.19	Even He who 
PSA.55.19	Because in them there has been no change [of heart],
PSA.55.19	And they do not fear God [at all].
PSA.55.20	He [my companion] has put out his hands against those who were at peace with him;
PSA.55.20	He has 
PSA.55.21	The words of his mouth were smoother than butter,
PSA.55.21	But his heart was hostile;
PSA.55.21	His words were softer than oil,
PSA.55.21	Yet they were drawn swords.
PSA.55.22	Cast your burden on the L
PSA.55.22	He will never allow the righteous to be shaken (slip, fall, fail).
PSA.55.23	But You, O God, will bring down the wicked to the pit of destruction;
PSA.55.23	Men of blood and treachery will not live out half their days.
PSA.55.23	But I will [boldly and unwaveringly] trust in You.
PSA.56.1	Be gracious to me, O God, for man has trampled on me;
PSA.56.1	All day long the adversary oppresses 
PSA.56.2	My enemies have trampled upon me all day long,
PSA.56.2	For they are many who fight proudly against me.
PSA.56.3	When I am afraid,
PSA.56.3	I will put my trust 
PSA.56.4	In God, whose word I praise;
PSA.56.4	In God I have put my trust;
PSA.56.4	I shall not fear.
PSA.56.4	What can mere man do to me?
PSA.56.5	All day long they twist my words 
PSA.56.5	All their thoughts are against me for evil.
PSA.56.6	They attack, they hide 
PSA.56.6	They watch my steps,
PSA.56.6	As they have [expectantly] waited 
PSA.56.7	Cast them out because of their wickedness.
PSA.56.7	In anger bring down the peoples, O God!
PSA.56.8	You have taken account of my wanderings;
PSA.56.8	Put my tears in Your bottle.
PSA.56.8	Are they not recorded in Your book?
PSA.56.9	Then my enemies will turn back in the day when I call;
PSA.56.9	This I know, that God is for me.
PSA.56.10	In God, 
PSA.56.10	In the L
PSA.56.11	In God have I put my trust 
PSA.56.11	What can man do to me?
PSA.56.12	Your vows are 
PSA.56.12	I will give thank offerings to You.
PSA.56.13	For You have rescued my soul from death,
PSA.56.13	Yes, and my feet from stumbling,
PSA.56.13	So that I may walk before God
PSA.56.13	In the light of life.
PSA.57.1	Be gracious to me, O God, be gracious 
PSA.57.1	For my soul finds shelter 
PSA.57.1	And in the shadow of Your wings I will take refuge 
PSA.57.1	Until destruction passes by.
PSA.57.2	I will cry to God Most High,
PSA.57.2	Who accomplishes 
PSA.57.3	He will send from heaven and save me;
PSA.57.3	He calls to account him who tramples me down. Selah.
PSA.57.3	God will send out His lovingkindness and His truth.
PSA.57.4	My life is among lions;
PSA.57.4	I must lie among those who breathe out fire—
PSA.57.4	The sons of men whose teeth are spears and arrows,
PSA.57.4	And their tongue a sharp sword.
PSA.57.5	Be exalted above the heavens, O God;
PSA.57.5	Let Your glory 
PSA.57.6	They 
PSA.57.6	My very life was bowed down.
PSA.57.6	They dug a pit before me;
PSA.57.6	Into the midst of it they themselves have fallen. Selah.
PSA.57.7	My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast 
PSA.57.7	I will sing, yes, I will sing praises [to You]!
PSA.57.8	Awake, my glory!
PSA.57.8	Awake, harp and lyre!
PSA.57.8	I will awaken the dawn.
PSA.57.9	I will praise 
PSA.57.9	I will sing praises to You among the nations.
PSA.57.10	For Your faithfulness 
PSA.57.10	And Your truth to the clouds.
PSA.57.11	Be exalted above the heavens, O God;
PSA.57.11	Let Your glory 
PSA.58.1	Do you indeed speak righteousness, O gods (heavenly beings)?
PSA.58.1	Do you judge fairly, O sons of men?
PSA.58.2	No, in your heart you devise wrongdoing;
PSA.58.2	On earth you deal out the violence of your hands.
PSA.58.3	The wicked are estranged from the womb;
PSA.58.3	These go astray from birth, speaking lies [even twisted partial truths].
PSA.58.4	Their poison is like the venom of a serpent;
PSA.58.4	They are like the deaf horned viper that stops up its ear,
PSA.58.5	So that it does not listen to the voice of charmers,
PSA.58.5	Or of the skillful enchanter casting [cunning] spells.
PSA.58.6	O God, break their teeth in their mouth;
PSA.58.6	Break out the fangs of the young lions, O L
PSA.58.7	Let them flow away like water that runs off;
PSA.58.7	When he aims his arrows, let them be as headless shafts.
PSA.58.8	Like the miscarriage of a woman which never sees the sun.
PSA.58.9	Before your cooking pots can feel the 
PSA.58.9	He will sweep them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning ones alike.
PSA.58.10	The [unyieldingly] righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance [of God];
PSA.58.10	He will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
PSA.58.11	Men will say, “Surely there is a reward for the righteous;
PSA.58.11	Surely there is a God who judges on the earth.”
PSA.59.1	Deliver me from my enemies, O my God;
PSA.59.1	Set me 
PSA.59.2	Deliver me from those who practice wrongdoing,
PSA.59.2	And save me from bloodthirsty men.
PSA.59.3	Look! They lie in wait for my life;
PSA.59.3	Fierce 
PSA.59.3	Not for my wrongdoing nor for any sin of mine, O L
PSA.59.4	They run and set themselves against me though there is no guilt in me;
PSA.59.4	Stir Yourself to meet 
PSA.59.5	You, O L
PSA.59.5	Arise to punish all the nations;
PSA.59.5	Spare no one 
PSA.59.6	They return at evening, they howl 
PSA.59.6	And go [prowling] around the city.
PSA.59.7	Look how they belch out [insults] with their mouths;
PSA.59.7	Swords [of sarcasm, ridicule, slander, and lies] are in their lips,
PSA.59.7	For 
PSA.59.8	But You, O L
PSA.59.8	You scoff at 
PSA.59.9	O [God] my strength, I will watch for You;
PSA.59.9	For God is my stronghold [my refuge, my protector, my high tower].
PSA.59.10	My God in His [steadfast] lovingkindness will meet me;
PSA.59.10	God will let me look 
PSA.59.11	Do not kill them, or my people will forget;
PSA.59.11	Scatter them 
PSA.59.11	O Lord our shield!
PSA.59.12	For the sin of their mouths and the words of their lips,
PSA.59.12	Let them even be trapped in their pride,
PSA.59.12	And on account of the curses and lies which they tell.
PSA.59.13	Destroy 
PSA.59.13	Let them know that God rules over Jacob (Israel)
PSA.59.13	To the ends of the earth. Selah.
PSA.59.14	They return at evening, they howl 
PSA.59.14	And go [prowling] around the city.
PSA.59.15	They wander around for food [to devour]
PSA.59.15	And growl all night if they are not satisfied.
PSA.59.16	But as for me, I will sing of Your mighty strength 
PSA.59.16	Yes, I will sing joyfully of Your lovingkindness in the morning;
PSA.59.16	For You have been my stronghold
PSA.59.16	And a refuge in the day of my distress.
PSA.59.17	To You, O [God] my strength, I will sing praises;
PSA.59.17	For God is my stronghold [my refuge, my protector, my high tower], the God who shows me [steadfast] lovingkindness.
PSA.60.1	O God, You have rejected us 
PSA.60.1	You have been angry; O restore us 
PSA.60.2	You have made the land quake, You have split it open;
PSA.60.2	Heal its rifts, for it shakes 
PSA.60.3	You have made Your people experience hardship;
PSA.60.3	You have given us wine to drink that makes us stagger 
PSA.60.4	You have set up a banner for those who fear You [with awe-inspired reverence and submissive wonder—a banner to shield them from attack],
PSA.60.4	A banner that may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.
PSA.60.5	That Your beloved ones may be rescued,
PSA.60.5	Save with Your right hand and answer us.
PSA.60.6	God has spoken in His holiness [in His promises]:
PSA.60.6	“I will rejoice, I will divide [the land of] Shechem and measure out the Valley of Succoth [west to east].
PSA.60.7	Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine;
PSA.60.7	Ephraim is My helmet;
PSA.60.7	Judah is My scepter.
PSA.60.8	Moab is My 
PSA.60.8	Over Edom I shall throw My shoe [in triumph];
PSA.60.8	Over Philistia I raise the shout [of victory].”
PSA.60.9	Who will bring me into the besieged city [of Petra]?
PSA.60.9	Who will lead me to Edom?
PSA.60.10	Have You not rejected us, O God?
PSA.60.10	And will You not go out with our armies?
PSA.60.11	Give us help against the enemy,
PSA.60.11	For the help of man is worthless (ineffectual, without purpose).
PSA.60.12	Through God we will have victory,
PSA.60.12	For He will trample down our enemies.
PSA.61.1	Hear my cry, O God;
PSA.61.1	Listen to my prayer.
PSA.61.2	From the end of the earth I call to You, when my heart is overwhelmed 
PSA.61.2	Lead me to the rock that is higher than I [a rock that is too high to reach without Your help].
PSA.61.3	For You have been a shelter 
PSA.61.3	A strong tower against the enemy.
PSA.61.4	Let me dwell in Your tent forever;
PSA.61.4	Let me take refuge in the shelter of Your wings. Selah.
PSA.61.5	For You have heard my vows, O God;
PSA.61.5	You have given me the inheritance of those who fear Your name [with reverence].
PSA.61.6	You will prolong the king’s life [adding days upon days];
PSA.61.6	His years will be like many generations.
PSA.61.7	He will sit enthroned forever before [the face of] God;
PSA.61.7	Appoint lovingkindness and truth to watch over 
PSA.61.8	So I will sing praise to Your name forever,
PSA.61.8	Paying my vows day by day.
PSA.62.1	For God alone my soul 
PSA.62.1	From Him comes my salvation.
PSA.62.2	He alone is my rock and my salvation,
PSA.62.2	My defense 
PSA.62.3	How long will you attack a man
PSA.62.3	So that you may murder him, all of you,
PSA.62.3	Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?
PSA.62.4	They consult only to throw him down from his high position [to dishonor him];
PSA.62.4	They delight in lies.
PSA.62.4	They bless with [the words of] their mouths,
PSA.62.4	But inwardly they curse. Selah.
PSA.62.5	For God alone my soul waits in silence 
PSA.62.5	For my hope is from Him.
PSA.62.6	He only is my rock and my salvation;
PSA.62.6	My fortress 
PSA.62.7	On God my salvation and my glory rest;
PSA.62.7	He is my rock of [unyielding] strength, my refuge is in God.
PSA.62.8	Trust [confidently] in Him at all times, O people;
PSA.62.8	Pour out your heart before Him.
PSA.62.8	God is a refuge for us. Selah.
PSA.62.9	Men of low degree are only a breath (emptiness), and men of [high] rank are a lie (delusion).
PSA.62.9	In the balances they go up [because they have no measurable weight or value];
PSA.62.9	They are together lighter than a breath.
PSA.62.10	Do not trust in oppression,
PSA.62.10	And do not vainly hope in robbery;
PSA.62.10	If riches increase, do not set your heart on them.
PSA.62.11	God has spoken once,
PSA.62.11	Twice I have heard this:
PSA.62.11	That power belongs to God.
PSA.62.12	Also to You, O Lord, belong lovingkindness 
PSA.62.12	For You compensate every man according to [the value of] his work.
PSA.63.1	O God, You are my God; with deepest longing I will seek You;
PSA.63.1	My 
PSA.63.1	In a dry and weary land where there is no water.
PSA.63.2	So I have gazed upon You in the sanctuary,
PSA.63.2	To see Your power and Your glory.
PSA.63.3	Because Your lovingkindness is better than life,
PSA.63.3	My lips shall praise You.
PSA.63.4	So will I bless You as long as I live;
PSA.63.4	I will lift up my hands in Your name.
PSA.63.5	My 
PSA.63.5	And my mouth offers praises [to You] with joyful lips.
PSA.63.6	When I remember You on my bed,
PSA.63.6	I meditate 
PSA.63.7	For You have been my help,
PSA.63.7	And in the shadow of Your wings [where I am always protected] I sing for joy.
PSA.63.8	My 
PSA.63.8	Your right hand upholds me.
PSA.63.9	But those who seek my life to destroy it
PSA.63.9	Will [be destroyed and] go into the depths of the earth [into the underworld].
PSA.63.10	They will be given over to the power of the sword;
PSA.63.10	They will be a prey for foxes.
PSA.63.11	But the king will rejoice in God;
PSA.63.11	Everyone who swears by Him [honoring the true God, acknowledging His authority and majesty] will glory,
PSA.63.11	For the mouths of those who speak lies will be stopped.
PSA.64.1	Hear my voice, O God, in my 
PSA.64.1	Guard my life from the terror of the enemy.
PSA.64.2	Hide me from the secret counsel 
PSA.64.2	From the scheming of those who do wrong,
PSA.64.3	Who have sharpened their tongues like a sword.
PSA.64.3	They aim venomous words as arrows,
PSA.64.4	To shoot from ambush at the blameless [one];
PSA.64.4	Suddenly they shoot at him, without fear.
PSA.64.5	They encourage themselves in [their pursuit of] an evil agenda;
PSA.64.5	They talk of laying snares secretly;
PSA.64.5	They say, “Who will discover us?”
PSA.64.6	They devise acts of injustice, 
PSA.64.6	“We are ready with a well-conceived plan.”
PSA.64.6	For the inward thought and the heart of a man are deep (mysterious, unsearchable).
PSA.64.7	But God will shoot them with an [unexpected] arrow;
PSA.64.7	Suddenly they will be wounded.
PSA.64.8	So they will be caused to stumble;
PSA.64.8	Their own tongue is against them;
PSA.64.8	All who gaze at them will shake the head [in scorn].
PSA.64.9	Then all men will fear [God’s judgment];
PSA.64.9	They will declare the work of God,
PSA.64.9	And they will consider 
PSA.64.10	The righteous will rejoice in the L
PSA.64.10	All the upright in heart will glory 
PSA.65.1	To You belongs silence [the submissive wonder of reverence], and [it bursts into] praise in Zion, O God;
PSA.65.1	And to You the vow shall be performed.
PSA.65.2	O You who hear prayer,
PSA.65.2	To You all mankind comes.
PSA.65.3	Wickedness 
PSA.65.3	Yet as for our transgressions,
PSA.65.3	You forgive them [removing them from Your sight].
PSA.65.4	Blessed is the one whom You choose and bring near
PSA.65.4	To dwell in Your courts.
PSA.65.4	We will be filled with the goodness of Your house,
PSA.65.4	Your holy temple.
PSA.65.5	By awesome 
PSA.65.5	You who are the trust 
PSA.65.6	Who creates the mountains by His strength,
PSA.65.6	Being clothed with power,
PSA.65.7	Who stills the roaring of the seas,
PSA.65.7	The roaring of their waves,
PSA.65.7	And the tumult of the peoples,
PSA.65.8	So they who dwell at the ends 
PSA.65.8	You make the dawn and the sunset shout for joy.
PSA.65.9	You visit the earth and make it overflow [with water];
PSA.65.9	You greatly enrich it;
PSA.65.9	The stream of God is full of water;
PSA.65.9	You provide their grain, when You have prepared the earth.
PSA.65.10	You water its furrows abundantly,
PSA.65.10	You smooth its ridges;
PSA.65.10	You soften it with showers,
PSA.65.10	You bless its growth.
PSA.65.11	You crown the year with Your bounty,
PSA.65.11	And Your paths overflow.
PSA.65.12	The pastures of the wilderness drip [with dew],
PSA.65.12	And the hills are encircled with joy.
PSA.65.13	The meadows are clothed with flocks
PSA.65.13	And the valleys are covered with grain;
PSA.65.13	They shout for joy and they sing.
PSA.66.1	Shout joyfully to God, all the earth;
PSA.66.2	Sing of the honor 
PSA.66.2	Make His praise glorious.
PSA.66.3	Say to God, “How awesome 
PSA.66.3	Because of the greatness of Your power Your enemies will pretend to be obedient to You.
PSA.66.4	All the earth will [bow down to] worship You [in submissive wonder],
PSA.66.4	And will sing praises to You;
PSA.66.4	They will praise Your name in song.” Selah.
PSA.66.5	Come and see the works of God,
PSA.66.5	He is awesome in His deeds toward the children of men.
PSA.66.6	He turned the sea into dry land;
PSA.66.6	They crossed through the river on foot;
PSA.66.6	There we rejoiced in Him.
PSA.66.7	Who rules by His might forever,
PSA.66.7	His eyes keep watch on the nations;
PSA.66.7	Do not let the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.
PSA.66.8	Bless our God, O peoples,
PSA.66.8	And make the sound of His praise 
PSA.66.9	Who keeps us among the living,
PSA.66.9	And does not allow our feet to slip 
PSA.66.10	For You have tested us, O God;
PSA.66.10	You have refined us as silver is refined.
PSA.66.11	You brought us into the net;
PSA.66.11	You laid a heavy burden [of servitude] on 
PSA.66.12	You made men (charioteers) 
PSA.66.12	We went through fire and through water,
PSA.66.12	Yet You brought us out into a [broad] 
PSA.66.13	I shall come into Your house with burnt offerings;
PSA.66.13	I shall pay You my vows,
PSA.66.14	Which my lips uttered
PSA.66.14	And my mouth spoke as a promise when I was in distress.
PSA.66.15	I shall offer to You burnt offerings of fat lambs,
PSA.66.15	With the [sweet] smoke of rams;
PSA.66.15	I will offer bulls with male goats. Selah.
PSA.66.16	Come and hear, all who fear God [and worship Him with awe-inspired reverence and obedience],
PSA.66.16	And I will tell what He has done for me.
PSA.66.17	I cried aloud to Him;
PSA.66.17	He was highly praised with my tongue.
PSA.66.18	If I regard sin 
PSA.66.18	The Lord will not hear [me];
PSA.66.19	But certainly God has heard [me];
PSA.66.19	He has given heed to the voice of my prayer.
PSA.66.20	Blessed be God,
PSA.66.20	Who has not turned away my prayer
PSA.66.20	Nor His lovingkindness from me.
PSA.67.1	God be gracious 
PSA.67.1	And make His face shine [with favor] on us— Selah.
PSA.67.2	That Your way may be known on earth,
PSA.67.2	Your salvation 
PSA.67.3	Let the 
PSA.67.3	Let all the peoples praise You.
PSA.67.4	Let the nations be glad and sing for joy,
PSA.67.4	For You will judge the people fairly
PSA.67.4	And guide the nations on earth. Selah.
PSA.67.5	Let the peoples praise You, O God;
PSA.67.5	Let all the peoples praise You.
PSA.67.6	The earth has yielded its harvest [as evidence of His approval];
PSA.67.6	God, our God, blesses us.
PSA.67.7	God blesses us,
PSA.67.7	And all the ends of the earth shall fear Him [with awe-inspired reverence and submissive wonder].
PSA.68.1	Let God arise, and His enemies be scattered;
PSA.68.1	Let those who hate Him flee before Him.
PSA.68.2	As smoke is driven away, so drive 
PSA.68.2	As wax melts before the fire,
PSA.68.2	So let the wicked 
PSA.68.3	But let the righteous be glad; let them be in good spirits before God,
PSA.68.3	Yes, let them rejoice with delight.
PSA.68.4	Sing to God, sing praises to His name;
PSA.68.4	Lift up 
PSA.68.4	His name is the L
PSA.68.5	A father of the fatherless and a judge 
PSA.68.5	Is God in His holy habitation.
PSA.68.6	God makes a home for the lonely;
PSA.68.6	He leads the prisoners into prosperity,
PSA.68.6	Only the stubborn 
PSA.68.7	O God, when You went out before Your people,
PSA.68.7	When You marched through the wilderness, Selah.
PSA.68.8	The earth trembled;
PSA.68.8	The heavens also poured down 
PSA.68.8	Sinai itself trembled at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
PSA.68.9	You, O God, sent abroad plentiful rain;
PSA.68.9	You confirmed Your inheritance when it was parched 
PSA.68.10	Your flock found a dwelling place in it;
PSA.68.10	O God, in Your goodness You provided for the poor.
PSA.68.11	The Lord gives the command [to take Canaan];
PSA.68.11	The women who proclaim the good news are a great host (army);
PSA.68.12	“The kings of the [enemies’] armies flee, they flee,
PSA.68.12	And the beautiful woman who remains at home divides the spoil [left behind].”
PSA.68.13	When you lie down [to rest] among the 
PSA.68.13	You [Israel] are like the wings of a dove [of victory] overlaid with silver,
PSA.68.13	Its feathers glistening with gold [trophies taken from the enemy].
PSA.68.14	When the Almighty scattered [the Canaanite] kings in the land of Canaan,
PSA.68.14	It was snowing on 
PSA.68.15	A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan;
PSA.68.15	A [high] mountain of many summits is Mount Bashan [rising east of the Jordan].
PSA.68.16	Why do you look with envy, mountains with many peaks,
PSA.68.16	At the mountain [of the city of Zion] which God has desired for His dwelling place?
PSA.68.16	Yes, the L
PSA.68.17	The chariots of God are 
PSA.68.17	The Lord is among them as He was at Sinai, in holiness.
PSA.68.18	You have ascended on high, You have led away captive 
PSA.68.18	You have received gifts among men,
PSA.68.18	Even from the rebellious also, that the L
PSA.68.19	Blessed be the Lord, who bears our burden day by day,
PSA.68.19	The God who is our salvation! Selah.
PSA.68.20	God is to us a God of acts of salvation;
PSA.68.20	And to 
PSA.68.21	Surely God will shatter the head of His enemies,
PSA.68.21	The hairy scalp of one who goes on in his guilty ways.
PSA.68.22	The Lord said, “I will bring your enemies back from Bashan;
PSA.68.22	I will bring them back from the depths of the [Red] Sea,
PSA.68.23	That your foot may crush them in blood,
PSA.68.23	That the tongue of your dogs 
PSA.68.24	They have seen Your [solemn] 
PSA.68.24	The procession of my God, my King, into the sanctuary [in holiness].
PSA.68.25	The singers go in front, the players of instruments last;
PSA.68.25	Between them the maidens playing on tambourines.
PSA.68.26	Bless God in the congregations, [give thanks, gratefully praise Him],
PSA.68.26	The L
PSA.68.27	The youngest is there, Benjamin, ruling them,
PSA.68.27	The princes of Judah and their company [the southern tribes],
PSA.68.27	The princes of Zebulun and the princes of Naphtali [the northern tribes].
PSA.68.28	Your God has commanded your strength [your power in His service and your resistance to temptation];
PSA.68.28	Show Yourself strong, O God, who acted on our behalf.
PSA.68.29	Because of Your temple at Jerusalem
PSA.68.29	[Pagan] kings will bring gifts to You [out of respect].
PSA.68.30	Rebuke the beasts [living] among the reeds [in Egypt],
PSA.68.30	The herd of bulls (the leaders) with the calves of the peoples;
PSA.68.30	Trampling underfoot the pieces of silver;
PSA.68.30	He has scattered the peoples who delight in war.
PSA.68.31	Princes 
PSA.68.31	Ethiopia will quickly stretch out her hands [with the offerings of submission] to God.
PSA.68.32	Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth,
PSA.68.32	Sing praises to the Lord! Selah.
PSA.68.33	To Him who rides in the highest heavens, the ancient heavens,
PSA.68.33	Behold, He sends out His voice, a mighty 
PSA.68.34	Ascribe strength to God;
PSA.68.34	His majesty is over Israel
PSA.68.34	And His strength is in the skies.
PSA.68.35	O God, 
PSA.68.35	The God of Israel gives strength and power to His people.
PSA.68.35	Blessed be God!
PSA.69.1	Save me, O God,
PSA.69.1	For the waters have threatened my life [they have come up to my neck].
PSA.69.2	I have sunk in deep mire, where there is no foothold;
PSA.69.2	I have come into deep waters, where a flood overwhelms me.
PSA.69.3	I am weary with my crying; my throat is parched;
PSA.69.3	My eyes fail while I wait [with confident expectation] for my God.
PSA.69.4	Those who hate me without cause are more than the hairs of my head;
PSA.69.4	Those who would destroy me are powerful, being my enemies wrongfully;
PSA.69.4	I am forced to restore what I did not steal.
PSA.69.5	O God, You know my folly;
PSA.69.5	My wrongs are not hidden from You.
PSA.69.6	Do not let those who wait [confidently] for You be 
PSA.69.6	Do not let those who seek You [as necessary for life itself] be dishonored through me, O God of Israel,
PSA.69.7	Because for Your sake I have borne reproach;
PSA.69.7	Confusion 
PSA.69.8	I have become estranged from my brothers
PSA.69.8	And an alien to my mother’s sons.
PSA.69.9	For zeal for Your house has consumed me,
PSA.69.9	And the [mocking] insults of those who insult You have fallen on me.
PSA.69.10	When I wept 
PSA.69.10	It became my reproach.
PSA.69.11	When I made sackcloth my clothing [as one in mourning],
PSA.69.11	I became a byword [a mere object of scorn] to them.
PSA.69.12	They who sit in the [city’s] gate talk about me 
PSA.69.12	And I am the song of the drunkards.
PSA.69.13	But as for me, my prayer is to You, O L
PSA.69.13	O God, in the greatness of Your favor 
PSA.69.13	Answer me with truth [that is, the faithfulness of Your salvation].
PSA.69.14	Rescue me from the mire and do not let me sink;
PSA.69.14	Let me be rescued from those who hate me and from the deep waters.
PSA.69.15	Do not let the floodwater overwhelm me,
PSA.69.15	Nor the deep waters swallow me up,
PSA.69.15	Nor the pit [of Sheol] shut its mouth over me.
PSA.69.16	Answer me, O L
PSA.69.16	According to the greatness of Your compassion, turn to me.
PSA.69.17	Do not hide Your face from Your servant,
PSA.69.17	For I am in distress; answer me quickly.
PSA.69.18	Draw near to my soul and redeem it;
PSA.69.18	Ransom me because of my enemies [so that they do not delight in my distress].
PSA.69.19	You know my reproach and my shame and my dishonor [how I am insulted];
PSA.69.19	My adversaries are all before You [each one fully known].
PSA.69.20	Reproach 
PSA.69.20	I looked for sympathy, but there was none,
PSA.69.20	And for comforters, but I found none.
PSA.69.21	They (self-righteous hypocrites) also gave me gall [poisonous and bitter] for my food,
PSA.69.21	And for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
PSA.69.22	May their table [with all its abundance and luxury] become a snare [to them];
PSA.69.22	And when they are in peace [secure at their sacrificial feasts], 
PSA.69.23	May their eyes be dimmed so that they cannot see,
PSA.69.23	And make their loins shake continually [in terror and weakness].
PSA.69.24	Pour out Your indignation on them,
PSA.69.24	And let [the fierceness of] Your burning anger overtake them.
PSA.69.25	May their encampment be desolate;
PSA.69.25	May no one dwell in their tents.
PSA.69.26	For they have persecuted him whom You have struck,
PSA.69.26	And they tell of the pain of those whom You have pierced 
PSA.69.27	Add [unforgiven] iniquity to their iniquity [in Your book],
PSA.69.27	And may they not come into Your 
PSA.69.28	May they be blotted out of the book of life [and their lives come to an end]
PSA.69.28	And may they not be recorded with the righteous (those in right standing with God).
PSA.69.29	But I am sorrowful and in pain;
PSA.69.29	May Your salvation, O God, set me [securely] on high.
PSA.69.30	I will praise the name of God with song
PSA.69.30	And magnify Him with thanksgiving.
PSA.69.31	And it will please the L
PSA.69.31	Or a young bull with horns and hoofs.
PSA.69.32	The humble have seen it and are glad;
PSA.69.32	You who seek God [requiring Him as your greatest need], let your heart revive 
PSA.69.33	For the L
PSA.69.33	And does not despise His 
PSA.69.34	Let heaven and earth praise Him,
PSA.69.34	The seas and everything that moves in them.
PSA.69.35	For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah,
PSA.69.35	That His servants may remain there and possess it.
PSA.69.36	The descendants of His servants will inherit it,
PSA.69.36	And those who love His name will dwell in it.
PSA.70.1	O God, 
PSA.70.1	O L
PSA.70.2	Let those be ashamed and humiliated
PSA.70.2	Who seek my life;
PSA.70.2	Let them be turned back and humiliated
PSA.70.2	Who delight in my hurt.
PSA.70.3	Let them be turned back because of their shame 
PSA.70.3	Who say, “Aha, aha!”
PSA.70.4	May all those who seek You [as life’s first priority] rejoice and be glad in You;
PSA.70.4	May those who love Your salvation say continually,
PSA.70.4	“Let God be magnified!”
PSA.70.5	But I am afflicted and needy;
PSA.70.5	Come quickly to me, O God!
PSA.70.5	You are my help and my rescuer;
PSA.70.5	O L
PSA.71.1	In you, O L
PSA.71.1	Let me never be 
PSA.71.2	In Your righteousness deliver me and rescue me;
PSA.71.2	Incline Your ear to me and save me.
PSA.71.3	Be to me a rock of refuge 
PSA.71.3	You have given the commandment to save me,
PSA.71.3	For You are my rock and my fortress.
PSA.71.4	Rescue me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked (godless),
PSA.71.4	From the grasp of the unrighteous and ruthless man.
PSA.71.5	For You are my hope;
PSA.71.5	O Lord G
PSA.71.6	Upon You have I relied 
PSA.71.6	You are He who took me from my mother’s womb 
PSA.71.6	My praise is continually of You.
PSA.71.7	I am as a wonder to many,
PSA.71.7	For You are my strong refuge.
PSA.71.8	My mouth is filled with Your praise
PSA.71.8	And with Your glory all day long.
PSA.71.9	Do not cast me off 
PSA.71.9	Do not abandon me when my strength fails 
PSA.71.10	For my enemies have spoken against me;
PSA.71.10	Those who watch for my life have consulted together,
PSA.71.11	Saying, “God has abandoned him;
PSA.71.11	Pursue and seize him, for there is no one to rescue 
PSA.71.12	O God, do not be far from me;
PSA.71.12	O my God, come quickly to help me!
PSA.71.13	Let those who attack my life be ashamed and consumed;
PSA.71.13	Let them be covered with reproach and dishonor, who seek to injure me.
PSA.71.14	But as for me, I will wait 
PSA.71.14	And will praise You yet more and more.
PSA.71.15	My mouth shall tell of Your righteousness
PSA.71.15	And of Your [deeds of] salvation all day long,
PSA.71.15	For their number is more than I know.
PSA.71.16	I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord G
PSA.71.16	I will make mention of Your righteousness, Yours alone.
PSA.71.17	O God, You have taught me from my youth,
PSA.71.17	And I still declare Your wondrous works 
PSA.71.18	And even when I am old and gray-headed, O God, do not abandon me,
PSA.71.18	Until I declare Your [mighty] strength to this generation,
PSA.71.18	Your power to all who are to come.
PSA.71.19	Your righteousness, O God, 
PSA.71.19	You who have done great things;
PSA.71.19	O God, who is like You, [who is Your equal]?
PSA.71.20	You who have shown 
PSA.71.20	Will revive 
PSA.71.20	And will bring me up again from the depths of the earth.
PSA.71.21	May You increase my greatness (honor)
PSA.71.21	And turn to comfort me.
PSA.71.22	I will also praise You with the harp,
PSA.71.22	Your truth 
PSA.71.22	To You I will sing praises with the lyre,
PSA.71.22	O Holy One of Israel.
PSA.71.23	My lips will shout for joy when I sing praises to You,
PSA.71.23	And my soul, which You have redeemed.
PSA.71.24	My tongue also will speak of Your righteousness all day long;
PSA.71.24	For they are ashamed, for they are humiliated who seek my injury.
PSA.72.1	Give the king [knowledge of] Your judgments, O God,
PSA.72.1	And [the spirit of] Your righteousness to the king’s son [to guide all his ways].
PSA.72.2	May he judge Your people with righteousness,
PSA.72.2	And Your afflicted with justice.
PSA.72.3	The mountains will bring peace 
PSA.72.3	And the hills, in [the establishment of] righteousness.
PSA.72.4	May he bring justice to the poor among the people,
PSA.72.4	Save the children of the needy
PSA.72.4	And crush the oppressor,
PSA.72.5	Let them fear You [with awe-inspired reverence and worship You with obedience] while the sun endures,
PSA.72.5	And as long as the moon [reflects light], throughout all generations.
PSA.72.6	May he come down like rain on the mown grass,
PSA.72.6	Like showers that water the earth.
PSA.72.7	In his days may the righteous flourish,
PSA.72.7	And peace abound until the moon is no more.
PSA.72.8	May he also rule from sea to sea
PSA.72.8	And from the River [Euphrates] to the ends of the earth.
PSA.72.9	The nomads of the desert will bow before him,
PSA.72.9	And his enemies will 
PSA.72.10	The kings of Tarshish and of the islands will bring offerings;
PSA.72.10	The kings of Sheba and Seba will offer gifts.
PSA.72.11	Yes, all kings will bow down before him,
PSA.72.11	All nations will serve him.
PSA.72.12	For he will rescue the needy when he cries for help,
PSA.72.12	The afflicted 
PSA.72.13	He will have compassion on the poor and needy,
PSA.72.13	And he will save the lives of the needy.
PSA.72.14	He will redeem their life from oppression 
PSA.72.14	And their blood will be precious in His sight.
PSA.72.15	So may he live, and may the gold of Sheba be given to him;
PSA.72.15	And let them pray for him continually;
PSA.72.15	Let them bless 
PSA.72.16	There will be an abundance of grain in the soil on the top of the 
PSA.72.16	Its fruit will wave like [the cedars of] Lebanon,
PSA.72.16	And those of the city will flourish like grass of the earth.
PSA.72.17	May his name endure forever;
PSA.72.17	May his name continue as long as the sun;
PSA.72.17	And let men bless themselves by him;
PSA.72.17	Let all nations call him blessed.
PSA.72.18	Blessed be the L
PSA.72.18	Who alone does wonderful things.
PSA.72.19	Blessed be His glorious name forever;
PSA.72.19	And may the whole earth be filled with His glory.
PSA.72.19	Amen and Amen.
PSA.72.20	The prayers of David son of Jesse are ended.
PSA.73.1	Truly God is good to Israel,
PSA.73.1	To those who are pure in heart.
PSA.73.2	But as for me, my feet came close to stumbling,
PSA.73.2	My steps had almost slipped.
PSA.73.3	For I was envious of the arrogant
PSA.73.3	As I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
PSA.73.4	For there are no pains in their death,
PSA.73.4	Their body is fat 
PSA.73.5	They are not in trouble 
PSA.73.5	Nor are they plagued like mankind.
PSA.73.6	Therefore pride is their necklace;
PSA.73.6	Violence covers them like a garment [like a long, luxurious robe].
PSA.73.7	Their eye bulges from fatness [they have more than the heart desires];
PSA.73.7	The imaginations of their mind run riot [with foolishness].
PSA.73.8	They mock and wickedly speak of oppression;
PSA.73.8	They speak loftily [with malice].
PSA.73.9	They set their mouth against the heavens,
PSA.73.9	And their tongue swaggers through the earth.
PSA.73.10	Therefore his people return to this place,
PSA.73.10	And waters of abundance [offered by the irreverent] are [blindly] drunk by them.
PSA.73.11	They say, “How does God know?
PSA.73.11	Is there knowledge [of us] with the Most High?”
PSA.73.12	Behold, these are the ungodly,
PSA.73.12	Who always prosper 
PSA.73.13	Surely then in vain I have cleansed my heart
PSA.73.13	And washed my hands in innocence.
PSA.73.14	For all the day long have I been stricken,
PSA.73.14	And punished every morning.
PSA.73.15	If I had said, “I will say this,” [and expressed my feelings],
PSA.73.15	I would have betrayed the generation of Your children.
PSA.73.16	When I considered how to understand this,
PSA.73.16	It was too great an effort for me 
PSA.73.17	Until I came into the sanctuary of God;
PSA.73.17	Then I understood [for I considered] their end.
PSA.73.18	Surely You set the wicked-minded 
PSA.73.18	You cast them down to destruction.
PSA.73.19	How they are destroyed in a moment!
PSA.73.19	They are completely swept away by sudden terrors!
PSA.73.20	Like a dream [which seems real] until one awakens,
PSA.73.20	O Lord, when stirred, [You observe the wicked], You will despise their image.
PSA.73.21	When my heart was embittered
PSA.73.21	And I was pierced within [as with the fang of an adder],
PSA.73.22	Then I was senseless and ignorant;
PSA.73.22	I was like a beast before You.
PSA.73.23	Nevertheless I am continually with You;
PSA.73.23	You have taken hold of my right hand.
PSA.73.24	You will guide me with Your counsel,
PSA.73.24	And afterward receive me to honor 
PSA.73.25	Whom have I in heaven [but You]?
PSA.73.25	And besides You, I desire nothing on earth.
PSA.73.26	My flesh and my heart may fail,
PSA.73.26	But God is the rock 
PSA.73.27	For behold, those who are far from You will perish;
PSA.73.27	You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful 
PSA.73.28	But as for me, it is good for me to draw near to God;
PSA.73.28	I have made the Lord G
PSA.73.28	That I may tell of all Your works.
PSA.74.1	O God, why have You rejected us forever?
PSA.74.1	Why does Your anger smoke against the sheep of Your pasture?
PSA.74.2	Remember Your congregation, which You have purchased of old,
PSA.74.2	Which You have redeemed to be the tribe of Your inheritance;
PSA.74.2	Remember Mount Zion, where You have dwelt.
PSA.74.3	Turn your footsteps [quickly] toward the perpetual ruins;
PSA.74.3	The enemy has damaged everything within the sanctuary.
PSA.74.4	In the midst of Your meeting place Your enemies have roared [with their battle cry];
PSA.74.4	They have set up their own emblems for signs [of victory].
PSA.74.5	It seems as if one had lifted up
PSA.74.5	An axe in a forest of trees [to set a record of destruction].
PSA.74.6	And now all the carved work [of the meeting place]
PSA.74.6	They smash with hatchets and hammers.
PSA.74.7	They have burned Your sanctuary to the ground;
PSA.74.7	They have profaned the dwelling place of Your 
PSA.74.8	They said in their heart, “Let us completely subdue them.”
PSA.74.8	They have burned all the meeting places of God in the land.
PSA.74.9	We do not see our symbols;
PSA.74.9	There is no longer any prophet [to guide us],
PSA.74.9	Nor does any among us know for how long.
PSA.74.10	O God, how long will the adversary scoff?
PSA.74.10	Is the enemy to revile Your name forever?
PSA.74.11	Why do You withdraw Your hand, even Your right hand [from judging the enemy]?
PSA.74.12	Yet God is my King of old,
PSA.74.12	Working salvation in the midst of the earth.
PSA.74.13	You divided the [Red] Sea by Your strength;
PSA.74.13	You broke the heads of the 
PSA.74.14	You crushed the heads of 
PSA.74.14	You gave him as food for the creatures of the wilderness.
PSA.74.15	You broke open fountains and streams;
PSA.74.15	You dried up ever-flowing rivers.
PSA.74.16	The day is Yours, the night also is Yours;
PSA.74.16	You have established 
PSA.74.17	You have defined 
PSA.74.17	You have made summer and winter.
PSA.74.18	Remember this, O L
PSA.74.18	And a foolish 
PSA.74.19	Oh, do not hand over the soul of your turtledove to the wild beast;
PSA.74.19	Do not forget the life of Your afflicted forever.
PSA.74.20	Consider the covenant [You made with Abraham],
PSA.74.20	For the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence.
PSA.74.21	Let not the oppressed return dishonored;
PSA.74.21	Let the afflicted and needy praise Your name.
PSA.74.22	Arise, O God, plead Your own cause;
PSA.74.22	Remember how the foolish man scoffs at You all day long.
PSA.74.23	Do not forget the [clamoring] voices of Your adversaries,
PSA.74.23	The uproar of those who rise against You, which ascends continually [to Your ears].
PSA.75.1	We give thanks 
PSA.75.1	For Your [wonderful works declare that Your] 
PSA.75.1	People declare Your wonders.
PSA.75.2	“When I select an appointed time,
PSA.75.2	I will judge with equity,” [says the L
PSA.75.3	“The earth and all the inhabitants of it melt [in tumultuous times].
PSA.75.3	It is I who will steady its pillars. Selah.
PSA.75.4	I said to the arrogant, ‘Do not boast;’
PSA.75.4	And to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up the horn [of self-glorification].
PSA.75.5	Do not lift up your [defiant and aggressive] horn on high,
PSA.75.5	Do not speak with a stiff neck.’ ”
PSA.75.6	For not from the east, nor from the west,
PSA.75.6	Nor from the desert comes exaltation.
PSA.75.7	But God is the Judge;
PSA.75.7	He puts down one and lifts up another.
PSA.75.8	For a cup [of His wrath] is in the hand of the L
PSA.75.8	It is well mixed 
PSA.75.8	And all the wicked of the earth must drain it and drink down to its dregs.
PSA.75.9	But as for me, I will declare it 
PSA.75.9	I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
PSA.75.10	All the horns of the wicked He will cut off,
PSA.75.10	But the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.
PSA.76.1	God is known in Judah;
PSA.76.1	His name is great in Israel.
PSA.76.2	His tabernacle is in Salem (Jerusalem);
PSA.76.2	His dwelling place is in Zion.
PSA.76.3	There He broke the flaming arrows,
PSA.76.3	The shield, the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah.
PSA.76.4	You are glorious 
PSA.76.4	More majestic than the mountains of prey.
PSA.76.5	The stouthearted have been stripped of their spoil,
PSA.76.5	They have slept the sleep [of death];
PSA.76.5	And none of the warriors could use his hands.
PSA.76.6	At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob,
PSA.76.6	Both rider and horse were cast into a dead sleep [of death].
PSA.76.7	You, even You, are to be feared [with the submissive wonder of reverence];
PSA.76.7	Who may stand in Your presence when once You are angry?
PSA.76.8	You caused judgment to be heard from heaven;
PSA.76.8	The earth feared and was quiet
PSA.76.9	When God arose to [establish] judgment,
PSA.76.9	To save all the humble of the earth. Selah.
PSA.76.10	For the wrath of man shall praise You;
PSA.76.10	With a remnant of wrath You will clothe 
PSA.76.11	Make vows to the L
PSA.76.11	Let all who are around Him bring gifts to Him who is to be feared [with awe-inspired reverence].
PSA.76.12	He will cut off the spirit of princes;
PSA.76.12	He is awesome 
PSA.77.1	My voice rises to God, and I will cry aloud;
PSA.77.1	My voice rises to God, and He will hear me.
PSA.77.2	In the day of my trouble I [desperately] sought the Lord;
PSA.77.2	In the night my hand was 
PSA.77.2	My soul refused to be comforted.
PSA.77.3	I remember God; then I am disquieted 
PSA.77.3	I sigh [in prayer], and my spirit grows faint. Selah.
PSA.77.4	You have held my eyelids open;
PSA.77.4	I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
PSA.77.5	I have considered the ancient days,
PSA.77.5	The years [of prosperity] of long, long ago.
PSA.77.6	I will remember my song in the night;
PSA.77.6	I will meditate with my heart,
PSA.77.6	And my spirit searches:
PSA.77.7	Will the Lord reject forever?
PSA.77.7	And will He never be favorable again?
PSA.77.8	Has His lovingkindness ceased forever?
PSA.77.8	Have His promises ended for all time?
PSA.77.9	Has God forgotten to be gracious?
PSA.77.9	Or has He in anger withdrawn His compassion? Selah.
PSA.77.10	And I said, “This is my grief,
PSA.77.10	That the right hand of the Most High has changed [and His lovingkindness is withheld].”
PSA.77.11	I will [solemnly] remember the deeds of the L
PSA.77.11	Yes, I will [wholeheartedly] remember Your wonders of old.
PSA.77.12	I will meditate on all Your works
PSA.77.12	And thoughtfully consider all Your [great and wondrous] deeds.
PSA.77.13	Your way, O God, is holy [far from sin and guilt].
PSA.77.13	What god is great like our God?
PSA.77.14	You are the [awesome] God who works [powerful] wonders;
PSA.77.14	You have demonstrated Your power among the people.
PSA.77.15	You have with Your [great] arm redeemed Your people,
PSA.77.15	The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
PSA.77.16	The waters [of the Red Sea] saw You, O God;
PSA.77.16	The waters saw You, they were in anguish;
PSA.77.16	The deeps also trembled.
PSA.77.17	The clouds poured down water;
PSA.77.17	The skies sent out a sound [of rumbling thunder];
PSA.77.17	Your arrows (lightning) flashed here and there.
PSA.77.18	The voice of Your thunder was in the 
PSA.77.18	The lightnings illumined the world;
PSA.77.18	The earth trembled and shook.
PSA.77.19	Your way [of escape for Your people] was through the sea,
PSA.77.19	And Your paths through the great waters,
PSA.77.19	And Your footprints were not traceable.
PSA.77.20	You led Your people like a flock
PSA.77.20	By the hand of Moses and Aaron [to the promised goal].
PSA.78.1	Listen, O my people, to my teaching;
PSA.78.1	Incline your ears to the words of my mouth [and be willing to learn].
PSA.78.2	I will open my mouth in a parable [to instruct using examples];
PSA.78.2	I will utter dark 
PSA.78.3	Which we have heard and known,
PSA.78.3	And our fathers have told us.
PSA.78.4	We will not hide them from their children,
PSA.78.4	But [we will] tell to the generation to come the praiseworthy deeds of the L
PSA.78.4	And [tell of] His great might 
PSA.78.5	For He established a testimony (a specific precept) in Jacob
PSA.78.5	And appointed a law in Israel,
PSA.78.5	Which He commanded our fathers
PSA.78.5	That they should teach to their children [the great facts of God’s transactions with Israel],
PSA.78.6	That the generation to come might know them, that the children still to be born
PSA.78.6	May arise and recount them to their children,
PSA.78.7	That they should place their confidence in God
PSA.78.7	And not forget the works of God,
PSA.78.7	But keep His commandments,
PSA.78.8	And not be like their fathers—
PSA.78.8	A stubborn and rebellious generation,
PSA.78.8	A generation that did not prepare its heart to know 
PSA.78.8	And whose spirit was not faithful to God.
PSA.78.9	The sons of Ephraim were armed as archers and carrying bows,
PSA.78.10	They did not keep the covenant of God
PSA.78.10	And refused to walk according to His law;
PSA.78.11	And they forgot His [incredible] works
PSA.78.11	And His miraculous wonders that He had shown them.
PSA.78.12	He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers
PSA.78.12	In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan [where Pharaoh resided].
PSA.78.13	He divided the [Red] Sea and allowed them to pass through it,
PSA.78.13	And He made the waters stand up like [water behind] a dam.
PSA.78.14	In the daytime He led them with a cloud
PSA.78.14	And all the night with a light of fire.
PSA.78.15	He split rocks in the wilderness
PSA.78.15	And gave 
PSA.78.16	He brought streams also from the rock [at Rephidim and Kadesh]
PSA.78.16	And caused waters to run down like rivers.
PSA.78.17	Yet they still continued to sin against Him
PSA.78.17	By rebelling against the Most High in the desert.
PSA.78.18	And in their hearts they put God to the test
PSA.78.18	By asking for food according to their [selfish] appetite.
PSA.78.19	Then they spoke against God;
PSA.78.19	They said, “Can God prepare [food for] a table in the wilderness?
PSA.78.20	Behold, He struck the rock so that waters gushed out
PSA.78.20	And the streams overflowed;
PSA.78.20	Can He give bread also?
PSA.78.20	Or will He provide meat for His people?”
PSA.78.21	Therefore, when the L
PSA.78.21	A fire was kindled against Jacob,
PSA.78.21	And His anger mounted up against Israel,
PSA.78.22	Because they did not believe in God [they did not rely on Him, they did not adhere to Him],
PSA.78.22	And they did not trust in His salvation (His power to save).
PSA.78.23	Yet He commanded the clouds from above
PSA.78.23	And opened the doors of heaven;
PSA.78.24	And He rained down manna upon them to eat
PSA.78.24	And gave them the grain of heaven.
PSA.78.25	Man ate the bread of angels;
PSA.78.25	God sent them provision in abundance.
PSA.78.26	He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens
PSA.78.26	And by His [unlimited] power He guided the south wind.
PSA.78.27	He rained meat upon them like the dust,
PSA.78.27	And winged birds (quail) like the sand of the seas.
PSA.78.28	And He let them fall in the midst of their camp,
PSA.78.28	Around their tents.
PSA.78.29	So they ate and were well filled,
PSA.78.29	He gave them what they craved.
PSA.78.30	Before they had satisfied their desire,
PSA.78.30	And while their food was in their mouths,
PSA.78.31	The wrath of God rose against them
PSA.78.31	And killed some of the strongest of them,
PSA.78.31	And subdued the choice young men of Israel.
PSA.78.32	In spite of all this they still sinned,
PSA.78.32	For they did not believe in His wonderful 
PSA.78.33	Therefore He consumed their days like a breath [in emptiness and futility]
PSA.78.33	And their years in sudden terror.
PSA.78.34	When He killed [some of] them, then those remaining sought Him,
PSA.78.34	And they returned [to Him] and searched diligently for God [for a time].
PSA.78.35	And they remembered that God was their rock,
PSA.78.35	And the Most High God their Redeemer.
PSA.78.36	Nevertheless they flattered Him with their mouths
PSA.78.36	And lied to Him with their tongues.
PSA.78.37	For their heart was not steadfast toward Him,
PSA.78.37	Nor were they faithful to His covenant.
PSA.78.38	Many times He restrained His anger
PSA.78.38	And did not stir up all His wrath.
PSA.78.39	For He [graciously] remembered that they were mere [human] flesh,
PSA.78.39	A wind that goes and does not return.
PSA.78.40	How often they rebelled against Him in the wilderness
PSA.78.40	And grieved Him in the desert!
PSA.78.41	Again and again they tempted God,
PSA.78.41	And distressed the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.78.42	They did not remember [the miracles worked by] His [powerful] hand,
PSA.78.42	Nor the day when He redeemed them from the enemy,
PSA.78.43	How He worked His miracles in Egypt
PSA.78.43	And His wonders in the field of Zoan [where Pharaoh resided],
PSA.78.44	And turned their rivers into blood,
PSA.78.44	And their streams, so that they could not drink.
PSA.78.45	He sent among them swarms of flies which devoured them,
PSA.78.45	And frogs which destroyed them.
PSA.78.46	He also gave their crops to the grasshopper,
PSA.78.46	And the fruit of their labor to the locust.
PSA.78.47	He destroyed their vines with [great] hailstones
PSA.78.47	And their sycamore trees with frost.
PSA.78.48	He gave over their cattle also to the hailstones,
PSA.78.48	And their flocks 
PSA.78.49	He sent upon them His burning anger,
PSA.78.49	His fury and indignation and distress,
PSA.78.49	A band of angels of destruction [among them].
PSA.78.50	He leveled a path for His anger [to give it free run];
PSA.78.50	He did not spare their souls from death,
PSA.78.50	But turned over their lives to the plague.
PSA.78.51	He killed all the firstborn in Egypt,
PSA.78.51	The first and best of their strength in the tents [of the land of the sons] of Ham.
PSA.78.52	But God led His own people forward like sheep
PSA.78.52	And guided them in the wilderness like [a good shepherd with] a flock.
PSA.78.53	He led them safely, so that they did not fear;
PSA.78.53	But the sea engulfed their enemies.
PSA.78.54	So He brought them to His holy land,
PSA.78.54	To this mountain [Zion] which His right hand had acquired.
PSA.78.55	He also drove out the nations before the sons of Israel
PSA.78.55	And allotted 
PSA.78.55	And He had the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents [the tents of those who had been dispossessed].
PSA.78.56	Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God
PSA.78.56	And did not keep His testimonies (laws).
PSA.78.57	They turned back and acted unfaithfully like their fathers;
PSA.78.57	They were twisted like a warped bow [that will not respond to the archer’s aim].
PSA.78.58	For they provoked Him to [righteous] anger with their high places [devoted to idol worship]
PSA.78.58	And moved Him to jealousy with their carved images [by denying Him the love, worship, and obedience that is rightfully and uniquely His].
PSA.78.59	When God heard this, He was filled with [righteous] wrath;
PSA.78.59	And utterly rejected Israel, [greatly hating her ways],
PSA.78.60	So that He abandoned the tabernacle at Shiloh,
PSA.78.60	The tent in which He had dwelled among men,
PSA.78.61	And gave up His strength 
PSA.78.61	And His glory into the hand of the enemy (the Philistines).
PSA.78.62	He also handed His people over to the sword,
PSA.78.62	And was infuriated with His inheritance (Israel).
PSA.78.63	The fire [of war] devoured His young men,
PSA.78.63	And His [bereaved] virgins had no wedding songs.
PSA.78.64	His priests [Hophni and Phinehas] fell by the sword,
PSA.78.64	And His widows could not weep.
PSA.78.65	Then the Lord awakened as from sleep,
PSA.78.65	Like a [mighty] warrior who awakens from the sleep of wine [fully conscious of his power].
PSA.78.66	He drove His enemies backward;
PSA.78.66	He subjected them to lasting shame 
PSA.78.67	Moreover, He rejected the tent of Joseph,
PSA.78.67	And did not choose the tribe of Ephraim [in which the tabernacle stood].
PSA.78.68	But He chose the tribe of Judah [as Israel’s leader],
PSA.78.68	Mount Zion, which He loved [to replace Shiloh as His capital].
PSA.78.69	And He built His sanctuary [exalted] like the heights [of the heavens],
PSA.78.69	Like the earth which He has established forever.
PSA.78.70	He also chose David His servant
PSA.78.70	And took him from the sheepfolds;
PSA.78.71	To shepherd Jacob His people,
PSA.78.71	And Israel His inheritance.
PSA.78.72	So David shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart;
PSA.78.72	And guided them with his skillful hands.
PSA.79.1	O God, the nations have invaded [the land of Your people] Your inheritance;
PSA.79.1	They have defiled Your sacred temple;
PSA.79.1	They have laid Jerusalem in ruins.
PSA.79.2	They have given the dead bodies of Your servants as food to the birds of the heavens,
PSA.79.2	The flesh of Your godly ones to the beasts of the earth.
PSA.79.3	They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem,
PSA.79.3	And there was no one to bury them.
PSA.79.4	We have become an object of taunting to our neighbors [because of our humiliation],
PSA.79.4	A derision and mockery to those who encircle us.
PSA.79.5	How long, O L
PSA.79.5	Will Your jealousy [which cannot endure a divided allegiance] burn like fire?
PSA.79.6	Pour out Your wrath on the [Gentile] nations that do not know You,
PSA.79.6	And on the kingdoms that do not call on Your name.
PSA.79.7	For they have devoured Jacob
PSA.79.7	And made his pasture desolate.
PSA.79.8	O do not remember against us the sins 
PSA.79.8	Let Your compassion 
PSA.79.8	For we have been brought very low.
PSA.79.9	Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of Your name;
PSA.79.9	Rescue us, forgive us our sins for Your name’s sake.
PSA.79.10	Why should the [Gentile] nations say, “Where is their God?”
PSA.79.10	Let there be known [without delay] among the nations in our sight [and to this generation],
PSA.79.10	Your vengeance for the blood of Your servants which has been poured out.
PSA.79.11	Let the groaning 
PSA.79.11	According to the greatness of Your power keep safe those who are doomed to die.
PSA.79.12	And return into the lap of our neighbors sevenfold
PSA.79.12	The taunts with which they have taunted You, O Lord.
PSA.79.13	So we Your people, the sheep of Your pasture,
PSA.79.13	Will give You thanks forever;
PSA.79.13	We will declare 
PSA.80.1	Hear us O Shepherd of Israel,
PSA.80.1	You who lead Joseph like a flock;
PSA.80.1	You who sit enthroned above the cherubim [of the ark of the covenant], shine forth!
PSA.80.2	Before 
PSA.80.2	And come to save us!
PSA.80.3	Restore us, O God;
PSA.80.3	Cause Your face to shine on us [with favor and approval], and we will be saved.
PSA.80.4	O L
PSA.80.4	How long will You be angry with the prayers of Your people?
PSA.80.5	You have fed them the bread of tears,
PSA.80.5	And You have made them drink [bitter] tears in abundance.
PSA.80.6	You make us an object of contention to our neighbors,
PSA.80.6	And our enemies laugh [at our suffering] among themselves.
PSA.80.7	Restore us, O God of hosts;
PSA.80.7	And cause Your face to shine on us [with favor and approval], and we will be saved.
PSA.80.8	You uprooted a vine (Israel) from Egypt;
PSA.80.8	You drove out the [Canaanite] nations and planted the vine [in Canaan].
PSA.80.9	You cleared away 
PSA.80.9	And it took deep root and filled the land.
PSA.80.10	The mountains were covered with its shadow,
PSA.80.10	And its branches were like the cedars of God.
PSA.80.11	Israel sent out its branches to the [Mediterranean] Sea,
PSA.80.11	And its branches to the [Euphrates] River.
PSA.80.12	Why have You broken down its 
PSA.80.12	So that all who pass by pick its fruit?
PSA.80.13	A boar from the woods eats it away,
PSA.80.13	And the insects of the field feed on it.
PSA.80.14	Turn again [in favor to us], O God of hosts;
PSA.80.14	Look down from heaven and see, and take care of this vine,
PSA.80.15	Even the stock which Your right hand has planted,
PSA.80.15	And [look down on] the son that You have reared 
PSA.80.16	It is burned with fire, it is cut down;
PSA.80.16	They perish at the rebuke of Your [angry] appearance.
PSA.80.17	Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand,
PSA.80.17	Upon the son of man whom You have made strong for Yourself.
PSA.80.18	Then we shall not turn back from You;
PSA.80.18	Revive us and we will call on Your name.
PSA.80.19	Restore us, O L
PSA.80.19	Cause Your face to shine on us [in favor and approval], and we shall be saved.
PSA.81.1	Sing aloud to God our strength;
PSA.81.1	Shout for joy to the God of Jacob (Israel).
PSA.81.2	Raise a song, sound the timbrel,
PSA.81.2	The sweet sounding lyre with the harp.
PSA.81.3	Blow the trumpet at the New Moon,
PSA.81.3	At the 
PSA.81.4	For this is a statute for Israel,
PSA.81.4	An ordinance of the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.5	He established it for a testimony in 
PSA.81.5	When He went throughout the land of Egypt.
PSA.81.5	I heard the language [of One whom] I did not know, 
PSA.81.6	“I removed the burden from his shoulder;
PSA.81.6	His hands were freed from the basket.
PSA.81.7	You called in [the time of] trouble and I rescued you;
PSA.81.7	I answered you in the secret place of thunder;
PSA.81.7	I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah.
PSA.81.8	Hear, O My people, and I will admonish you—
PSA.81.8	O Israel, if you would listen to Me!
PSA.81.9	Let there be no strange god among you,
PSA.81.9	Nor shall you worship any foreign god.
PSA.81.10	I am the L
PSA.81.10	Who brought you up from the land of Egypt.
PSA.81.10	Open your mouth wide and I will fill it.
PSA.81.11	“But My people would not listen to My voice,
PSA.81.11	And Israel did not [consent to] obey Me.
PSA.81.12	So I gave them up to the stubbornness of their heart,
PSA.81.12	To walk in [the path of] their own counsel.
PSA.81.13	Oh, that My people would listen to Me,
PSA.81.13	That Israel would walk in My ways!
PSA.81.14	Then I would quickly subdue 
PSA.81.14	And turn My hand against their adversaries;
PSA.81.15	Those who hate the L
PSA.81.15	And their time 
PSA.81.16	But I would feed Israel with the finest of the wheat;
PSA.81.16	And with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.”
PSA.82.1	God stands in the divine assembly;
PSA.82.1	He judges among the gods (divine beings).
PSA.82.2	How long will you judge unjustly
PSA.82.2	And show partiality to the wicked? Selah.
PSA.82.3	Vindicate the weak and fatherless;
PSA.82.3	Do justice 
PSA.82.4	Rescue the weak and needy;
PSA.82.4	Rescue them from the hand of the wicked.
PSA.82.5	The rulers do not know nor do they understand;
PSA.82.5	They walk on in the darkness [of complacent satisfaction];
PSA.82.5	All the foundations of the earth [the fundamental principles of the administration of justice] are shaken.
PSA.82.6	I said, “You are 
PSA.82.6	Indeed, all of you are sons of the Most High.
PSA.82.7	Nevertheless you will die like men
PSA.82.7	And fall like any one of the princes.”
PSA.82.8	Arise, O God, judge the earth!
PSA.82.8	For to You belong all the nations.
PSA.83.1	Do not keep silent, O God;
PSA.83.1	Do not hold Your peace or be still, O God.
PSA.83.2	For behold, Your enemies are in tumult,
PSA.83.2	And those who hate You have raised their heads [in hatred of You].
PSA.83.3	They concoct crafty schemes against Your people,
PSA.83.3	And conspire together against Your hidden 
PSA.83.4	They have said, “Come, and let us wipe them out as a nation;
PSA.83.4	Let the name of Israel be remembered no more.”
PSA.83.5	For they have conspired together with one mind;
PSA.83.5	Against You they make a covenant—
PSA.83.6	The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,
PSA.83.6	Of Moab and the Hagrites,
PSA.83.7	Gebal and Ammon and Amalek,
PSA.83.7	Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre.
PSA.83.8	Assyria also has joined with them;
PSA.83.8	They have helped the children of Lot [the Ammonites and the Moabites] 
PSA.83.9	Deal with them as [You did] with Midian,
PSA.83.9	As with Sisera and Jabin at the brook of Kishon,
PSA.83.10	Who were destroyed at En-dor,
PSA.83.10	Who became like dung for the earth.
PSA.83.11	Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb
PSA.83.11	And all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
PSA.83.12	Who said, “Let us possess for ourselves
PSA.83.12	The pastures of God.”
PSA.83.13	O my God, make them like 
PSA.83.13	Like chaff before the wind [worthless and without substance].
PSA.83.14	Like fire consumes the forest,
PSA.83.14	And like the flame sets the mountains on fire,
PSA.83.15	So pursue them with Your tempest
PSA.83.15	And terrify them with [the violence of] Your storm.
PSA.83.16	Fill their faces with shame 
PSA.83.16	That they may [persistently] seek Your name, O L
PSA.83.17	Let them be ashamed and dismayed forever;
PSA.83.17	Yes, let them be humiliated and perish,
PSA.83.18	That they may know that You alone, whose name is the L
PSA.83.18	Are the Most High over all the earth.
PSA.84.1	How lovely are Your dwelling places,
PSA.84.1	O L
PSA.84.2	My soul (my life, my inner self) longs for and greatly desires the courts of the L
PSA.84.2	My heart and my flesh sing for joy to the living God.
PSA.84.3	The bird has found a house,
PSA.84.3	And the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young—
PSA.84.3	Even Your altars, O L
PSA.84.3	My King and my God.
PSA.84.4	Blessed 
PSA.84.4	They will be singing Your praises all the day long. Selah.
PSA.84.5	Blessed 
PSA.84.5	In 
PSA.84.6	Passing through the Valley of Weeping (
PSA.84.6	The early rain also covers it with blessings.
PSA.84.7	They go from strength to strength [increasing in victorious power];
PSA.84.8	O L
PSA.84.8	Listen, O God of Jacob! Selah.
PSA.84.9	See our shield, O God,
PSA.84.9	And look at the face of Your anointed [the king as Your representative].
PSA.84.10	For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand [anywhere else];
PSA.84.10	I would rather stand [as a doorkeeper] at the threshold of the house of my God
PSA.84.10	Than to live [at ease] in the tents of wickedness.
PSA.84.11	For the L
PSA.84.11	The L
PSA.84.11	No good thing will He withhold from those who walk uprightly.
PSA.84.12	O L
PSA.84.12	How blessed 
PSA.85.1	O L
PSA.85.1	You have restored [from Babylon] the captives of Jacob (Israel).
PSA.85.2	You have forgiven the wickedness of Your people;
PSA.85.2	You have covered all their sin. Selah.
PSA.85.3	You have withdrawn all Your wrath,
PSA.85.3	You have turned away from Your burning anger.
PSA.85.4	Restore us, O God of our salvation,
PSA.85.4	And cause Your indignation toward us to cease.
PSA.85.5	Will You be angry with us forever?
PSA.85.5	Will You prolong Your anger to all generations?
PSA.85.6	Will You not revive us 
PSA.85.6	That Your people may rejoice in You?
PSA.85.7	Show us Your lovingkindness, O L
PSA.85.7	And grant us Your salvation.
PSA.85.8	I will hear [with expectant hope] what God the L
PSA.85.8	For He will speak peace to His people, to His 
PSA.85.8	But let them not turn again to folly.
PSA.85.9	Surely His salvation is near to those who [reverently] fear Him [and obey Him with submissive wonder],
PSA.85.9	That glory [the manifest presence of God] may dwell in our land.
PSA.85.10	Steadfast love and truth 
PSA.85.10	Righteousness and peace kiss each other.
PSA.85.11	Truth springs from the earth,
PSA.85.11	And righteousness looks down from heaven.
PSA.85.12	Indeed, the L
PSA.85.12	And our land will yield its produce.
PSA.85.13	Righteousness will go before Him
PSA.85.13	And will make His footsteps into a way [in which to walk].
PSA.86.1	Incline Your ear, O L
PSA.86.1	For I am distressed and needy [I long for Your help].
PSA.86.2	Protect my life (soul), for I am godly 
PSA.86.2	O You my God, save Your servant, who trusts in You [believing in You and relying on You, confidently committing everything to You].
PSA.86.3	Be gracious 
PSA.86.3	For to You I cry out all the day long.
PSA.86.4	Make Your servant rejoice,
PSA.86.4	For to You, O Lord, I lift up my soul [all that I am—in prayer].
PSA.86.5	For You, O Lord, are good, and ready to forgive [our sins, sending them away, completely letting them go forever and ever];
PSA.86.5	And abundant in lovingkindness 
PSA.86.6	Hear, O L
PSA.86.6	And listen attentively to the voice of my supplications (specific requests)!
PSA.86.7	In the day of my trouble I will call upon You,
PSA.86.7	For You will answer me.
PSA.86.8	There is no one like You among the gods, O Lord,
PSA.86.8	Nor are there any works [of wonder and majesty] like Yours.
PSA.86.9	All nations whom You have made shall come and kneel down in worship before You, O Lord,
PSA.86.9	And they shall glorify Your name.
PSA.86.10	For You are great and do wondrous works!
PSA.86.10	You alone are God.
PSA.86.11	Teach me Your way, O L
PSA.86.11	I will walk 
PSA.86.11	Direct my heart to fear Your name [with awe-inspired reverence and submissive wonder].
PSA.86.12	I will give thanks 
PSA.86.12	And will glorify Your name forevermore.
PSA.86.13	For great is Your lovingkindness 
PSA.86.13	And You have rescued my life from the depths of Sheol [from death].
PSA.86.14	O God, arrogant 
PSA.86.14	A band of violent men have sought my life,
PSA.86.14	And they have not set You before them.
PSA.86.15	But You, O Lord, are a God [who protects and is] merciful and gracious,
PSA.86.15	Slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness and truth.
PSA.86.16	Turn to me, and be gracious to me;
PSA.86.16	Grant Your strength [Your might and the power to resist temptation] to Your servant,
PSA.86.16	And save the son of Your handmaid.
PSA.86.17	Show me a sign of [Your] goodwill,
PSA.86.17	That those who hate me may see it and be ashamed,
PSA.86.17	Because You, O L
PSA.87.1	His foundation is on the holy mountain.
PSA.87.2	The L
PSA.87.2	More than all the dwellings of Jacob (Israel).
PSA.87.3	Glorious things are spoken of you,
PSA.87.3	O city of God [Jerusalem]. Selah.
PSA.87.4	“I will mention Rahab (Egypt) and Babylon among those who know Me—
PSA.87.4	Behold, Philistia and Tyre with Ethiopia (Cush)—
PSA.87.4	‘This one was born there.’ ”
PSA.87.5	But of Zion it will be said, “This one and that one were born in her,”
PSA.87.5	And the Most High Himself will establish her.
PSA.87.6	The L
PSA.87.6	“This one was born there.” Selah.
PSA.87.7	The singers as well as the players of flutes 
PSA.87.7	“All my springs 
PSA.88.1	O L
PSA.88.1	I have cried out [for help] by day and in the night before You.
PSA.88.2	Let my prayer come before You 
PSA.88.2	Incline Your ear to my cry!
PSA.88.3	For my soul is full of troubles,
PSA.88.3	And my life draws near the grave (Sheol, the place of the dead).
PSA.88.4	I am counted among those who go down to the pit (grave);
PSA.88.4	I am like a man who has no strength [a mere shadow],
PSA.88.5	Like the slain who lie in a [nameless] grave,
PSA.88.5	Whom You no longer remember,
PSA.88.5	And they are cut off from Your hand.
PSA.88.6	You have laid me in the lowest pit,
PSA.88.6	In dark places, in the depths.
PSA.88.7	Your wrath has rested heavily upon me,
PSA.88.7	And You have afflicted me with all Your waves. Selah.
PSA.88.8	You have put my friends far from me;
PSA.88.8	You have made me an 
PSA.88.8	I am shut up and I cannot go out.
PSA.88.9	My eye grows dim with sorrow.
PSA.88.9	O L
PSA.88.9	I have spread out my hands to You [in prayer].
PSA.88.10	Will You perform wonders for the dead?
PSA.88.10	Shall the departed spirits arise and praise You? Selah.
PSA.88.11	Will Your lovingkindness be declared in the grave
PSA.88.11	Or Your faithfulness in Abaddon (the underworld)?
PSA.88.12	Will Your wonders be known in the darkness?
PSA.88.12	And Your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness [where the dead forget and are forgotten]?
PSA.88.13	But I have cried out to You, O L
PSA.88.13	And in the morning my prayer will come to You.
PSA.88.14	O L
PSA.88.14	Why do You hide Your face from me?
PSA.88.15	I was afflicted and close to death from my youth on;
PSA.88.15	I suffer Your terrors; I am overcome.
PSA.88.16	Your fierce wrath has swept over me;
PSA.88.16	Your terrors have destroyed me.
PSA.88.17	They have surrounded me like flood waters all day long;
PSA.88.17	They have completely encompassed me.
PSA.88.18	Lover and friend You have placed far from me;
PSA.88.18	My familiar friends are in darkness.
PSA.89.1	I will sing of the goodness 
PSA.89.1	With my mouth I will make known Your faithfulness from generation to generation.
PSA.89.2	For I have said, “Goodness 
PSA.89.2	In the heavens [unchangeable and majestic] You will establish Your faithfulness.”
PSA.89.3	[God has said] “I have made a covenant with My chosen one;
PSA.89.3	I have sworn to David My servant,
PSA.89.4	I will establish your seed forever
PSA.89.4	And I will build up your throne for all generations.” Selah.
PSA.89.5	The heavens (angels) praise Your wonders, O L
PSA.89.5	Your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.
PSA.89.6	For who in the heavens can be compared to the L
PSA.89.6	Who among the divine beings is like the L
PSA.89.7	A God greatly feared 
PSA.89.7	And awesome above all those who are around Him?
PSA.89.8	O L
PSA.89.8	Your faithfulness surrounds You [as an intrinsic, unchangeable part of Your very being].
PSA.89.9	You rule the swelling of the sea;
PSA.89.9	When its waves rise, You still them.
PSA.89.10	You have crushed Rahab (Egypt) like one who is slain;
PSA.89.10	You have scattered Your enemies with Your mighty arm.
PSA.89.11	The heavens are Yours, the earth also is Yours;
PSA.89.11	The world and all that is in it, You have founded 
PSA.89.12	The north and the south, You have created them;
PSA.89.12	Mount Tabor and Mount Hermon shout for joy at Your name.
PSA.89.13	You have a strong arm;
PSA.89.13	Mighty is Your hand, Your right hand is exalted.
PSA.89.14	Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne;
PSA.89.14	Lovingkindness and truth go before You.
PSA.89.15	Blessed 
PSA.89.15	They walk, O L
PSA.89.16	In Your name they rejoice all the day,
PSA.89.16	And in Your righteousness they are exalted.
PSA.89.17	For You are the glory of their strength [their proud adornment],
PSA.89.17	And by Your favor our horn is exalted.
PSA.89.18	For our shield belongs to the L
PSA.89.18	And our king to the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.89.19	Once You spoke in a vision to Your godly ones,
PSA.89.19	And said, “I have given help to one who is mighty [giving him the power to be a champion for Israel];
PSA.89.19	I have exalted one chosen from the people.
PSA.89.20	I have found David My servant;
PSA.89.20	With My holy oil I have anointed him,
PSA.89.21	With whom My hand shall be established 
PSA.89.21	My arm also shall strengthen him.
PSA.89.22	The enemy will not outwit him,
PSA.89.22	Nor will the wicked man afflict 
PSA.89.23	I will crush his adversaries before him,
PSA.89.23	And strike those who hate him.
PSA.89.24	My faithfulness and My steadfast lovingkindness shall be with him,
PSA.89.24	And in My name shall his horn be exalted [great power and prosperity shall be conferred upon him].
PSA.89.25	I will also 
PSA.89.25	And his right hand on the rivers [the tributaries of the Euphrates].
PSA.89.26	He will cry to Me, ‘You are my Father,
PSA.89.26	My God, and the rock of my salvation.’
PSA.89.27	I will also make him My firstborn (preeminent),
PSA.89.27	The highest of the kings of the earth.
PSA.89.28	My lovingkindness I will keep for him forevermore,
PSA.89.28	And My covenant will be confirmed to him.
PSA.89.29	His descendants I will establish forever,
PSA.89.29	And his throne [will endure] as the days of heaven.
PSA.89.30	“If his children 
PSA.89.30	And do not walk in My ordinances,
PSA.89.31	If they break My statutes
PSA.89.31	And do not keep My commandments,
PSA.89.32	Then I will punish their transgression with the rod [of discipline],
PSA.89.32	And [correct] their wickedness with stripes.
PSA.89.33	Nevertheless, I will not break off My lovingkindness from him,
PSA.89.33	Nor allow My faithfulness to fail.
PSA.89.34	My covenant I will not violate,
PSA.89.34	Nor will I alter the utterance of My lips.
PSA.89.35	Once [for all] I have sworn by My holiness, [My vow which cannot be violated];
PSA.89.35	I will not lie to David.
PSA.89.36	His 
PSA.89.36	And his throne [will continue] as the sun before Me.
PSA.89.37	It shall be established forever like the moon,
PSA.89.37	And the witness in the heavens is ever faithful.” Selah.
PSA.89.38	But [in apparent contradiction of all this] You [the faithful L
PSA.89.38	You have been full of wrath against Your anointed.
PSA.89.39	You have spurned 
PSA.89.39	You have profaned his crown [by casting it] in the dust.
PSA.89.40	You have broken down all his [city] walls;
PSA.89.40	You have brought his strongholds to ruin.
PSA.89.41	All who pass along the road rob him;
PSA.89.41	He has become the scorn of his neighbors.
PSA.89.42	You have exalted the right hand of his foes;
PSA.89.42	You have made all his enemies rejoice.
PSA.89.43	Also, You have turned back the edge of his sword
PSA.89.43	And have not made him [strong enough] to stand in battle.
PSA.89.44	You have put an end to his splendor
PSA.89.44	And have hurled his throne to the ground.
PSA.89.45	You have shortened the days of his youth;
PSA.89.45	You have covered him with shame. Selah.
PSA.89.46	How long, O L
PSA.89.46	Will You hide Yourself forever?
PSA.89.46	Will Your wrath burn like fire?
PSA.89.47	Remember how fleeting my lifetime is;
PSA.89.47	For what vanity, [for what emptiness, for what futility, for what wisp of smoke] You have created all the sons of men!
PSA.89.48	What man can live and not see death?
PSA.89.48	Can he rescue his soul from the [powerful] hand of Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead)? Selah.
PSA.89.49	O Lord, where are Your former lovingkindnesses [so abundant in the days of David and Solomon],
PSA.89.49	Which You swore to David in Your faithfulness?
PSA.89.50	Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Your servants [scorned, insulted, and disgraced];
PSA.89.50	How I bear in 
PSA.89.51	With which Your enemies have taunted, O L
PSA.89.51	With which they have mocked the footsteps of Your anointed.
PSA.89.52	Blessed be the L
PSA.89.52	Amen and Amen.
PSA.90.1	Lord, You have been our dwelling place [our refuge, our sanctuary, our stability] in all generations.
PSA.90.2	Before the mountains were born
PSA.90.2	Or before You had given birth to the earth and the world,
PSA.90.2	Even from everlasting to everlasting, You are [the eternal] God.
PSA.90.3	You turn man back to dust,
PSA.90.3	And say, “Return [to the earth], O children of [mortal] men!”
PSA.90.4	For a 
PSA.90.4	Are like yesterday when it is past,
PSA.90.4	Or as a watch in the night.
PSA.90.5	You have swept them away like a flood, they fall asleep [forgotten as soon as they are gone];
PSA.90.5	In the morning they are like grass which grows anew—
PSA.90.6	In the morning it flourishes and springs up;
PSA.90.6	In the evening it wilts and withers away.
PSA.90.7	For we have been consumed by Your anger
PSA.90.7	And by Your wrath we have been terrified.
PSA.90.8	You have placed our wickedness before you,
PSA.90.8	Our secret 
PSA.90.9	For all our days pass away in Your wrath;
PSA.90.9	We have finished our years like a whispered sigh.
PSA.90.10	The days of our life are 
PSA.90.10	Or even, if because of strength, eighty years;
PSA.90.10	Yet their pride [in additional years] is only labor and sorrow,
PSA.90.10	For it is soon gone and we fly away.
PSA.90.11	Who understands the power of Your anger? [Who connects this brevity of life among us with Your judgment of sin?]
PSA.90.11	And Your wrath, [who connects it] with the [reverent] fear that is due You?
PSA.90.12	So teach us to number our days,
PSA.90.12	That we may cultivate 
PSA.90.13	Turn, O L
PSA.90.13	Be compassionate toward Your servants—revoke Your sentence.
PSA.90.14	O satisfy us with Your lovingkindness in the morning [now, before we grow older],
PSA.90.14	That we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
PSA.90.15	Make us glad in proportion to the days You have afflicted us,
PSA.90.15	And the years we have suffered evil.
PSA.90.16	Let Your work [the signs of Your power] be revealed to Your servants
PSA.90.16	And Your [glorious] majesty to their children.
PSA.90.17	And let the [gracious] favor of the Lord our God be on us;
PSA.90.17	Confirm for us the work of our hands—
PSA.90.17	Yes, confirm the work of our hands.
PSA.91.1	He who 
PSA.91.1	Will remain secure 
PSA.91.2	I will say of the L
PSA.91.2	My God, in whom I trust [with great confidence, and on whom I rely]!”
PSA.91.3	For He will save you from the trap of the fowler,
PSA.91.3	And from the deadly pestilence.
PSA.91.4	He will cover you 
PSA.91.4	And under His wings you will find refuge;
PSA.91.4	His faithfulness is a shield and a wall.
PSA.91.5	You will not be afraid of the terror of night,
PSA.91.5	Nor of the arrow that flies by day,
PSA.91.6	Nor of the pestilence that stalks in darkness,
PSA.91.6	Nor of the destruction (sudden death) that lays waste at noon.
PSA.91.7	A thousand may fall at your side
PSA.91.7	And ten thousand at your right hand,
PSA.91.7	But danger will not come near you.
PSA.91.8	You will only [be a spectator as you] look on with your eyes
PSA.91.8	And witness the [divine] repayment of the wicked [as you watch safely from the shelter of the Most High].
PSA.91.9	Because you have made the L
PSA.91.9	Even the Most High, your dwelling place,
PSA.91.10	No evil will befall you,
PSA.91.10	Nor will any plague come near your tent.
PSA.91.11	For He will command His angels in regard to you,
PSA.91.11	To protect 
PSA.91.12	They will lift you up in their hands,
PSA.91.12	So that you do not [even] strike your foot against a stone.
PSA.91.13	You will tread upon the lion and cobra;
PSA.91.13	The young lion and the serpent you will trample underfoot.
PSA.91.14	“Because he set his love on Me, therefore I will save him;
PSA.91.14	I will set him [securely] on high, because he knows My name [he confidently trusts and relies on Me, knowing I will never abandon him, no, never].
PSA.91.15	He will call upon Me, and I will answer him;
PSA.91.15	I will be with him in trouble;
PSA.91.15	I will rescue him and honor him.
PSA.91.16	With a long life I will satisfy him
PSA.91.16	And I will let him see My salvation.”
PSA.92.1	It is a good 
PSA.92.1	To sing praises to Your name, O Most High,
PSA.92.2	To declare Your lovingkindness in the morning
PSA.92.2	And Your faithfulness by night,
PSA.92.3	With an instrument of ten strings and with the harp,
PSA.92.3	With a solemn sound on the lyre.
PSA.92.4	For You, O L
PSA.92.4	At the works of Your hands I joyfully sing.
PSA.92.5	How great are Your works, O L
PSA.92.5	Your thoughts are very deep [beyond man’s understanding].
PSA.92.6	A senseless man [in his crude and uncultivated state] knows nothing,
PSA.92.6	Nor does a [self-righteous] fool understand this:
PSA.92.7	That though the wicked sprout up like grass
PSA.92.7	And all evildoers flourish,
PSA.92.7	They will be destroyed forever.
PSA.92.8	But You, L
PSA.92.9	For behold, Your enemies, O L
PSA.92.9	For behold, Your enemies will perish;
PSA.92.9	All who do evil will be scattered.
PSA.92.10	But my horn [my emblem of strength and power] You have exalted like that of a wild ox;
PSA.92.10	I am anointed with fresh oil [for Your service].
PSA.92.11	My eye has looked on my foes;
PSA.92.11	My ears hear of the evildoers who rise up against me.
PSA.92.12	The righteous will flourish like the date palm [long-lived, upright and useful];
PSA.92.12	They will grow like a cedar in Lebanon [majestic and stable].
PSA.92.13	Planted in the house of the L
PSA.92.13	They will flourish in the courts of our God.
PSA.92.14	[Growing in grace] they will still thrive 
PSA.92.14	They will flourish 
PSA.92.15	[They are living memorials] to declare that the L
PSA.92.15	He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.
PSA.93.1	The L
PSA.93.1	The L
PSA.93.1	the world is firmly established, it cannot be moved.
PSA.93.2	Your throne is established from of old;

PSA.93.3	The floods have lifted up, O L
PSA.93.3	The floods have lifted up their voice;
PSA.93.3	The floods lift up their pounding waves.
PSA.93.4	More than the sounds of many waters,
PSA.93.4	More than the mighty breakers of the sea,

PSA.93.5	Your precepts are fully confirmed 
PSA.93.5	Holiness adorns Your house,

PSA.94.1	O God, You to whom vengeance belongs, shine forth [in judgment]!
PSA.94.2	Rise up, O Judge of the earth;

PSA.94.3	O L
PSA.94.3	How long will the wicked rejoice in triumph?
PSA.94.4	They pour out 
PSA.94.4	All who do evil boast proudly.
PSA.94.5	They crush Your people, O L
PSA.94.5	And afflict 
PSA.94.6	And murder the fatherless.
PSA.94.7	Yet they say, “The L
PSA.94.7	Nor does the God of Jacob (Israel) notice it.”
PSA.94.8	Consider thoughtfully, you senseless (stupid ones) among the people;
PSA.94.8	And you [dull-minded] fools, when will you become wise 
PSA.94.9	He who made the ear, does He not hear?
PSA.94.9	He who formed the eye, does He not see?
PSA.94.10	He who instructs the nations,
PSA.94.10	Does He not rebuke 
PSA.94.10	He who teaches man knowledge?
PSA.94.11	The L
PSA.94.11	That they are a mere breath (vain, empty, futile).
PSA.94.12	Blessed [with wisdom and prosperity] is the man whom You discipline 
PSA.94.12	And whom You teach from Your law,
PSA.94.13	That You may grant him [power to calm himself and find] peace in the days of adversity,
PSA.94.13	Until the pit is dug for the wicked 
PSA.94.14	For the L
PSA.94.14	Nor will He abandon His inheritance.
PSA.94.15	For judgment will again be righteous,
PSA.94.15	And all the upright in heart will follow it.
PSA.94.16	Who will stand up for me against the evildoers?
PSA.94.16	Who will take a stand for me against those who do wickedness?
PSA.94.17	If the L
PSA.94.17	I would soon have dwelt in [the land of] silence.
PSA.94.18	If I say, “My foot has slipped,”
PSA.94.18	Your compassion 
PSA.94.19	When my anxious thoughts multiply within me,
PSA.94.19	Your comforts delight me.
PSA.94.20	Can a throne of destruction be allied with You,
PSA.94.20	One which frames 
PSA.94.21	They band themselves together against the life of the righteous
PSA.94.21	And condemn the innocent to death.
PSA.94.22	But the L
PSA.94.22	And my God the rock of my refuge.

PSA.94.23	And will destroy them by means of their own evil;

PSA.102.22	And the kingdoms, to serve the L
PSA.102.23	He has exhausted my strength [humbling me with sorrow] in the way;
PSA.102.23	He has shortened my days.
PSA.102.24	I said, “O my God, do not take me away in the midst of my days;
PSA.102.24	Your years are [eternal] throughout all generations.
PSA.102.25	At the beginning You founded the earth;
PSA.102.25	The heavens are the work of Your hands.
PSA.102.26	Even they will perish, but You endure;
PSA.102.26	Yes, all of them will wear out like a garment.
PSA.102.26	Like clothing You will change them and they shall be changed.
PSA.102.27	But You remain the same,
PSA.102.27	And Your years will never end.
PSA.102.28	The children of Your servants will continue,
PSA.102.28	And their descendants will be established before You.”

PSA.103.3	Who heals all your diseases;
PSA.103.4	Who redeems your life from the pit,
PSA.103.4	Who crowns you [lavishly] with lovingkindness and tender mercy;
PSA.103.5	Who satisfies your years with good things,
PSA.103.5	So that your youth is renewed like the [soaring] eagle.
PSA.103.6	The L
PSA.103.6	And justice for all the oppressed.
PSA.103.7	He made known His ways [of righteousness and justice] to Moses,
PSA.103.7	His acts to the children of Israel.
PSA.103.8	The L
PSA.103.8	Slow to anger and abounding in compassion 
PSA.103.9	He will not always strive 
PSA.103.9	Nor will He keep 
PSA.103.10	He has not dealt with us according to our sins [as we deserve],
PSA.103.10	Nor rewarded us [with punishment] according to our wickedness.
PSA.103.11	For as the heavens are high above the earth,
PSA.103.11	So great is His lovingkindness toward those who fear 
PSA.103.12	As far as the east is from the west,
PSA.103.12	So far has He removed our transgressions from us.
PSA.103.13	Just as a father loves his children,
PSA.103.13	So the L
PSA.103.14	For He knows our [mortal] frame;
PSA.103.14	He remembers that we are [merely] dust.
PSA.103.15	As for man, his days are like grass;
PSA.103.15	Like a flower of the field, so he flourishes.
PSA.103.16	For the wind passes over it and it is no more,
PSA.103.16	And its place knows it no longer.
PSA.103.17	But the lovingkindness of the L
PSA.103.17	And His righteousness to children’s children,
PSA.103.18	To those who honor 
PSA.103.18	And remember to do His commandments [imprinting His word on their hearts].
PSA.103.19	The L
PSA.103.19	And His sovereignty rules over all [the universe].
PSA.103.20	Bless the L
PSA.103.20	You mighty ones who do His commandments,
PSA.103.20	Obeying the voice of His word!
PSA.103.21	Bless the L
PSA.103.21	You who serve Him and do His will.
PSA.103.22	Bless the L
PSA.103.22	Bless 
PSA.104.1	Bless 
PSA.104.1	O L
PSA.104.1	You are clothed with splendor and majesty,
PSA.104.2	[You are the One] who covers Yourself with light as with a garment,
PSA.104.2	Who stretches out the heavens like a tent curtain,
PSA.104.3	Who lays the beams of His upper chambers in the waters [above the firmament],
PSA.104.3	Who makes the clouds His chariot,
PSA.104.3	Who walks on the wings of the wind,
PSA.104.4	Who makes winds His messengers,
PSA.104.4	Flames of fire His ministers.
PSA.104.5	He established the earth on its foundations,
PSA.104.5	So that it will not be moved forever and ever.
PSA.104.6	You covered it with the deep as with a garment;
PSA.104.6	The waters were standing above the mountains.
PSA.104.7	At Your rebuke they fled;
PSA.104.7	At the sound of Your thunder they hurried away.
PSA.104.8	The mountains rose, the valleys sank down
PSA.104.8	To the place which You established for them.
PSA.104.9	You set a boundary [for the waters] that they may not cross over,
PSA.104.9	So that they will not return to cover the earth.
PSA.104.10	You send springs into the valleys;
PSA.104.10	Their waters flow among the mountains.
PSA.104.11	They give drink to every beast of the field;

PSA.104.13	The earth is satisfied with the fruit of His works.
PSA.104.14	He causes grass to grow for the cattle,
PSA.104.14	And all that the earth produces for cultivation by man,
PSA.104.14	So that he may bring food from the earth—
PSA.104.15	And wine which makes the heart of man glad,
PSA.104.15	So that he may make his face glisten with oil,
PSA.104.15	And bread to sustain 
PSA.104.16	The trees of the L
PSA.104.16	The cedars of Lebanon which He has planted,
PSA.104.17	Where the birds make their nests;
PSA.104.17	As for the stork, the fir trees are her house.
PSA.104.18	The high mountains are for the wild goats;

PSA.104.19	He made the moon for the seasons;
PSA.104.19	The sun knows the [exact] place of its setting.
PSA.104.20	You [O L
PSA.104.20	In which prowls about every wild beast of the forest.
PSA.104.21	The young lions roar after their prey
PSA.104.21	And seek their food from God.
PSA.104.22	When the sun arises, they withdraw
PSA.104.22	And lie down in their dens.
PSA.104.23	Man goes out to his work
PSA.104.23	And remains at his labor until evening.
PSA.104.24	O L
PSA.104.24	In wisdom You have made them all;
PSA.104.24	The earth is full of Your riches 
PSA.104.25	There is the sea, great and broad,
PSA.104.25	In which are swarms without number,
PSA.104.25	Creatures both small and great.
PSA.104.26	There the ships [of the sea] sail,
PSA.104.26	And Leviathan [the sea monster], which You have formed to play there.
PSA.104.27	They all wait for You
PSA.104.27	To give them their food in its appointed season.
PSA.104.28	You give it to them, they gather it up;
PSA.104.28	You open Your hand, they are filled 
PSA.104.29	You hide Your face, they are dismayed;
PSA.104.29	You take away their breath, they die
PSA.104.29	And return to their dust.
PSA.104.30	You send out Your Spirit, they are created;
PSA.104.30	You renew the face of the ground.

PSA.104.33	I will sing to the L

PSA.104.34	May my meditation be sweet 
PSA.104.34	As for me, I will rejoice 
PSA.104.35	Let sinners be consumed from the earth,
PSA.104.35	And let the wicked be no more.
PSA.104.35	Bless 
PSA.104.35	Praise the L
PSA.105.1	O give thanks to the L
PSA.105.1	Make known His deeds among the people.
PSA.105.2	Sing to Him, sing praises to Him;
PSA.105.2	Speak of all His wonderful acts 
PSA.105.3	Glory in His holy name;
PSA.105.3	Let the hearts of those who seek 
PSA.105.4	Seek 
PSA.105.4	Seek 
PSA.105.5	Remember [with awe and gratitude] the wonderful things which He has done,
PSA.105.5	His amazing deeds and the judgments uttered by His mouth [on His enemies, as in Egypt],
PSA.105.6	O you offspring of Abraham, His servant,
PSA.105.6	O you sons of Jacob, His chosen ones!
PSA.105.7	He is the L
PSA.105.7	His judgments are in all the earth.
PSA.105.8	He has remembered His covenant forever,
PSA.105.8	The word which He commanded 
PSA.105.9	And His sworn oath to Isaac,
PSA.105.10	Which He confirmed to Jacob as a statute,
PSA.105.10	To Israel as an everlasting covenant,
PSA.105.11	Saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan
PSA.105.11	As the measured portion of your inheritance.”
PSA.105.12	When there were only a few men in number,
PSA.105.12	Very few [in fact], and strangers in it;
PSA.105.13	And they wandered from one nation to another,
PSA.105.13	From one kingdom to another people,
PSA.105.14	He allowed no man to oppress them;
PSA.105.14	He rebuked kings for their sakes, 
PSA.105.15	“Do not touch My anointed ones,
PSA.105.15	And do My prophets no harm.”
PSA.105.16	And He called for a famine upon the land [of Egypt];
PSA.105.16	He 
PSA.105.17	He sent a man before them,
PSA.105.17	Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
PSA.105.18	His feet they hurt with shackles;
PSA.105.19	Until the time that his word [of prophecy regarding his brothers] came true,
PSA.105.19	The word of the L
PSA.105.20	The king sent and released him,
PSA.105.20	The ruler of the peoples [of Egypt], and set him free.
PSA.105.21	He made Joseph lord of his house
PSA.105.21	And ruler of all his possessions,
PSA.105.22	To imprison his princes at his will,
PSA.105.22	That he might teach his elders wisdom.
PSA.105.23	Israel also came into Egypt;
PSA.105.23	Thus Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
PSA.105.24	There the L
PSA.105.24	And made them more powerful than their enemies.
PSA.105.25	He turned the heart [of the Egyptians] to hate His people,
PSA.105.25	To deal craftily with His servants.
PSA.105.26	He sent Moses His servant,
PSA.105.26	And Aaron, whom He had chosen.
PSA.105.27	They exhibited His wondrous signs among them,
PSA.105.28	He sent [thick, oppressive] darkness and made 
PSA.105.28	And Moses and Aaron did not rebel against His words.
PSA.105.29	He turned Egypt’s waters into blood
PSA.105.29	And caused their fish to die.
PSA.105.30	Their land swarmed with frogs,
PSA.105.30	Even in the chambers of their kings.
PSA.105.31	He spoke, and there came swarms of flies
PSA.105.31	And gnats in all their territory.
PSA.105.32	He gave them hail for rain,
PSA.105.32	With flaming fire in their land.
PSA.105.33	He struck their vines also and their fig trees,
PSA.105.33	And shattered the [ice-laden] trees of their territory.
PSA.105.34	He spoke, and the [migratory] locusts came,
PSA.105.34	And the young locusts, even without number,
PSA.105.35	And ate up all the vegetation in their land,
PSA.105.35	And devoured the fruit of their ground.
PSA.105.36	He also struck down all the firstborn in their land,
PSA.105.36	The first fruits 
PSA.105.37	He brought the sons of Israel out [of Egypt] with silver and gold,
PSA.105.37	And among their tribes there was not one who stumbled.
PSA.105.38	Egypt was glad when they departed,
PSA.105.38	For the dread 
PSA.105.39	The L
PSA.105.39	And a fire to illumine the night.
PSA.105.40	The Israelites asked, and He brought quail,
PSA.105.40	And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
PSA.105.41	He opened the rock and water flowed out;
PSA.105.41	It ran in the dry places like a river.
PSA.105.42	For He remembered His holy word
PSA.105.42	To Abraham His servant;
PSA.105.43	He brought out His people with joy,
PSA.105.43	And His chosen ones with a joyful shout,
PSA.105.44	He gave them the lands of the nations [of Canaan],
PSA.105.44	So that they would possess 
PSA.105.45	So that they might observe His precepts
PSA.105.45	And keep His laws [obediently accepting and honoring and valuing them].
PSA.105.45	Praise the L
PSA.106.1	Praise the L
PSA.106.1	Oh give thanks to the L
PSA.106.1	For His mercy 
PSA.106.2	Who can put into words the mighty deeds of the L
PSA.106.2	Or who can proclaim all His praise [that is due Him]?
PSA.106.3	Blessed are those who observe justice [by honoring God’s precepts],
PSA.106.3	Who practice righteousness at all times.
PSA.106.4	Remember me, O L
PSA.106.4	Visit me with Your salvation [when You rescue them],
PSA.106.5	That I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones,
PSA.106.5	That I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation,
PSA.106.5	That I may glory with Your inheritance.
PSA.106.6	We have sinned like our fathers;
PSA.106.6	We have committed iniquity, we have behaved wickedly.
PSA.106.7	Our fathers in Egypt did not understand 
PSA.106.7	They did not remember the abundance of Your mercies 
PSA.106.7	But they were rebellious at the sea, at the 
PSA.106.8	Nevertheless He saved them for His name’s sake,
PSA.106.8	That He might make His [supreme] power known.
PSA.106.9	He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up;
PSA.106.9	And He led them through the depths as through a pasture.
PSA.106.10	So He saved them from the hand of the one that hated them,
PSA.106.10	And redeemed them from the hand of the [Egyptian] enemy.
PSA.106.11	And the waters covered their adversaries;
PSA.106.11	Not one of them was left.
PSA.106.12	Then Israel believed in [the validity of] His words;
PSA.106.12	They sang His praise.
PSA.106.13	But they quickly forgot His works;
PSA.106.13	They did not [patiently] wait for His counsel 
PSA.106.14	But lusted intensely in the wilderness
PSA.106.14	And tempted God [with their insistent desires] in the desert.
PSA.106.15	So He gave them their request,
PSA.106.15	But sent a wasting disease among them.
PSA.106.16	They envied Moses in the camp,
PSA.106.16	And Aaron [the high priest], the holy one of the L
PSA.106.17	Therefore the earth opened and swallowed Dathan,
PSA.106.17	And engulfed the company of Abiram.
PSA.106.18	And a fire broke out in their company;
PSA.106.18	The flame consumed the wicked.
PSA.106.19	They made a calf in Horeb (Sinai)
PSA.106.19	And worshiped a cast image.
PSA.106.20	Thus they exchanged [the true God who was] their glory
PSA.106.20	For the image of an ox that eats grass.
PSA.106.21	They forgot God their Savior,
PSA.106.21	Who had done such great things in Egypt,
PSA.106.22	Wonders in the land of Ham,
PSA.106.22	Awesome things at the Red Sea.
PSA.106.23	Therefore He said He would destroy them,
PSA.106.23	[And He would have done so] had not Moses, His chosen one, stepped into the gap before Him,
PSA.106.23	To turn away His wrath from destroying them.
PSA.106.24	Then they despised the pleasant land [of Canaan];
PSA.106.24	They did not believe in His word 
PSA.106.25	But they sulked 
PSA.106.25	They did not listen to the voice of the L
PSA.106.26	Therefore He lifted up His hand [swearing] to them,
PSA.106.26	That He would cause them to fall in the wilderness,
PSA.106.27	And that He would cast out their descendants among the nations
PSA.106.27	And scatter them in the lands [of the earth].
PSA.106.28	They joined themselves also to [the idol] Baal of Peor,
PSA.106.28	And ate sacrifices offered to the dead.
PSA.106.29	Thus they provoked Him to anger with their practices,
PSA.106.29	And a plague broke out among them.
PSA.106.30	Then Phinehas [the priest] stood up and 
PSA.106.30	And so the plague was halted.
PSA.106.31	And that was credited to him for righteousness,
PSA.106.31	To all generations forever.
PSA.106.32	They provoked Him to anger at the waters of 
PSA.106.32	So that it went hard with Moses on their account;
PSA.106.33	Because they were rebellious against His Spirit,
PSA.106.33	Moses spoke recklessly with his lips.
PSA.106.34	They did not destroy the [pagan] peoples [in Canaan],
PSA.106.34	As the L
PSA.106.35	But they mingled with the [idolatrous] nations
PSA.106.35	And learned their ways,
PSA.106.36	And served their idols,
PSA.106.36	Which became a [dreadful] snare to them.
PSA.106.37	They even sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons
PSA.106.38	And shed innocent blood,
PSA.106.38	Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,
PSA.106.38	Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan;
PSA.106.38	And the land was polluted with their blood.
PSA.106.39	In this way they became unclean in their practices;
PSA.106.39	They played the prostitute in their own deeds [by giving their worship, which belongs to God alone, to other “gods”].
PSA.106.40	Therefore the anger of the L
PSA.106.40	And He detested His own 
PSA.106.41	He gave them into the hands of the nations,
PSA.106.41	And those who hated them ruled over them.
PSA.106.42	Their enemies also oppressed them,
PSA.106.42	And they were subdued under the [powerful] hand of their enemies.
PSA.106.43	Many times He rescued them;
PSA.106.43	But they were rebellious in their counsel,
PSA.106.43	And sank down in their wickedness.
PSA.106.44	Nevertheless He looked [sympathetically] at their distress
PSA.106.44	When He heard their cry;
PSA.106.45	And He remembered His covenant for their sake,
PSA.106.45	And relented [rescinding their sentence] according to the greatness of His lovingkindness [when they cried out to Him],
PSA.106.46	He also made them 
PSA.106.46	Among those who had carried them away captive.
PSA.106.47	Save us, O L
PSA.106.47	And gather us from among the nations,
PSA.106.47	That we may give thanks to Your holy name
PSA.106.47	And glory in praising You.
PSA.106.48	Blessed be the L
PSA.106.48	From everlasting even to everlasting.
PSA.106.48	And let all the people say, “Amen.”
PSA.106.48	Praise the L
PSA.107.1	O give thanks to the L
PSA.107.1	For His compassion 
PSA.107.2	Let the redeemed of the L
PSA.107.2	Whom He has redeemed from the hand of the adversary,
PSA.107.3	And gathered them from the lands,
PSA.107.3	From the east and from the west,
PSA.107.3	From the north and from the 
PSA.107.4	They wandered in the wilderness in a [solitary] desert region;
PSA.107.4	And did not find a way to an inhabited city.
PSA.107.5	Hungry and thirsty,
PSA.107.5	They fainted.
PSA.107.6	Then they cried out to the L
PSA.107.6	And He rescued them from their distresses.
PSA.107.7	He led them by the straight way,
PSA.107.7	To an inhabited city [where they could establish their homes].
PSA.107.8	Let them give thanks to the L
PSA.107.8	And for His wonderful acts to the children of men!
PSA.107.9	For He satisfies the parched throat,
PSA.107.9	And fills the hungry appetite with what is good.
PSA.107.10	Some dwelt in darkness and in the deep (deathly) darkness,
PSA.107.10	Prisoners [bound] in misery and chains,
PSA.107.11	Because they had rebelled against the precepts of God
PSA.107.11	And spurned the counsel of the Most High.
PSA.107.12	Therefore He humbled their heart with hard labor;
PSA.107.12	They stumbled and there was no one to help.
PSA.107.13	Then they cried out to the L
PSA.107.13	And He saved them from their distresses.
PSA.107.14	He brought them out of darkness and the deep (deathly) darkness
PSA.107.14	And broke their bonds apart.
PSA.107.15	Let them give thanks to the L
PSA.107.15	And for His wonderful acts to the children of men!
PSA.107.16	For He has shattered the gates of bronze
PSA.107.16	And cut the bars of iron apart.
PSA.107.17	Fools, because of their rebellious way,
PSA.107.17	And because of their sins, were afflicted.
PSA.107.18	They detested all kinds of food,
PSA.107.18	And they drew near to the gates of death.
PSA.107.19	Then they cried out to the L
PSA.107.19	And He saved them from their distresses.
PSA.107.20	He sent His word and healed them,
PSA.107.20	And rescued them from their destruction.
PSA.107.21	Let them give thanks to the L
PSA.107.21	And for His wonderful acts to the children of men!
PSA.107.22	And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving,
PSA.107.22	And speak of His deeds with shouts of joy!
PSA.107.23	Those who go down to the sea in ships,
PSA.107.23	Who do business on great waters;
PSA.107.24	They have seen the works of the L
PSA.107.24	And His wonders in the deep.
PSA.107.25	For He spoke and raised up a stormy wind,
PSA.107.25	Which lifted up the waves of the sea.
PSA.107.26	They went up toward the heavens [on the crest of the wave], they went down again to the depths [of the watery trough];
PSA.107.26	Their courage melted away in their misery.
PSA.107.27	They staggered and trembled like a drunken man,
PSA.107.27	And were at their wits’ end [all their wisdom was useless].
PSA.107.28	Then they cried out to the L
PSA.107.28	And He brought them out of their distresses.
PSA.107.29	He hushed the storm to a gentle whisper,
PSA.107.29	So that the waves of the sea were still.
PSA.107.30	Then they were glad because of the calm,
PSA.107.30	And He guided them to their desired haven (harbor).
PSA.107.31	Let them give thanks to the L
PSA.107.31	And for His wonderful acts to the children of men!
PSA.107.32	Let them exalt Him also in the congregation of the people,
PSA.107.32	And praise Him at the seat of the elders.
PSA.107.33	He turns rivers into a wilderness,
PSA.107.33	And springs of water into a thirsty ground;
PSA.107.34	A productive land into a [barren] salt waste,
PSA.107.34	Because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it.
PSA.107.35	He turns a wilderness into a pool of water
PSA.107.35	And a dry land into springs of water;
PSA.107.36	And there He has the hungry dwell,
PSA.107.36	So that they may establish an inhabited city,
PSA.107.37	And sow fields and plant vineyards,
PSA.107.37	And produce an abundant harvest.
PSA.107.38	Also He blesses them so that they multiply greatly,
PSA.107.38	And He does not let [the number of] their cattle decrease.
PSA.107.39	When they are diminished and bowed down (humbled)
PSA.107.39	Through oppression, misery, and sorrow,
PSA.107.40	He pours contempt on princes
PSA.107.40	And makes them wander in a pathless wasteland.
PSA.107.41	Yet He sets the needy securely on high, away from affliction,
PSA.107.41	And makes their families like a flock.
PSA.107.42	The upright see it and rejoice;
PSA.107.42	But all unrighteousness shuts its mouth.
PSA.107.43	Who is wise? Let him observe 
PSA.107.43	And [thoughtfully] consider the lovingkindness of the L
PSA.108.1	O God, my heart is steadfast [with confident faith];
PSA.108.1	I will sing, I will sing praises, even with my soul.
PSA.108.2	Awake, harp and lyre;
PSA.108.2	I will awaken the dawn!
PSA.108.3	I will praise 
PSA.108.3	And I will sing praises to You among the nations.
PSA.108.4	For Your lovingkindness is great 
PSA.108.4	Your truth 
PSA.108.5	Be exalted [in majesty], O God, above the heavens,
PSA.108.5	And Your glory above all the earth.
PSA.108.6	That Your beloved [ones] may be rescued,
PSA.108.6	Save with Your right hand, and answer me!
PSA.108.7	God has spoken in His 
PSA.108.7	“I will rejoice, I will portion out Shechem [as I divide Canaan among My people],
PSA.108.7	And measure out the Valley of Succoth.
PSA.108.8	Gilead is Mine, Manasseh is Mine;
PSA.108.8	Ephraim also is the helmet of My head [My stronghold, My defense];
PSA.108.8	Judah is My 
PSA.108.9	Moab is My washbowl;
PSA.108.9	Over Edom I will throw My shoe [to show Edom is Mine];
PSA.108.9	Over Philistia I will shout [in triumph].”
PSA.108.10	Who will bring me into the fortified city [of Petra]?
PSA.108.10	Who will lead me to Edom?
PSA.108.11	Have You not rejected us, O God?
PSA.108.11	And will You not go out, O God, with our armies?
PSA.108.12	Give us help against the adversary,
PSA.108.12	For deliverance by man is in vain [a worthless hope].
PSA.108.13	For it is He who will trample down our enemies.
PSA.109.1	O God of my praise!
PSA.109.1	Do not keep silent,
PSA.109.2	For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me;
PSA.109.2	They have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
PSA.109.3	They have also surrounded me with words of hatred,
PSA.109.3	And have fought against me without a cause.
PSA.109.4	In return for my love, they attack me,
PSA.109.4	But I am in prayer.
PSA.109.5	They have repaid me evil for good,
PSA.109.5	And hatred for my love.
PSA.109.6	Appoint a wicked man against him,
PSA.109.6	And let an attacker stand at his right hand [to kill him].
PSA.109.7	When he enters into dispute, let wickedness come about.
PSA.109.7	Let his prayer [for help] result [only] in sin.
PSA.109.8	Let his days be few;
PSA.109.8	And let another take his office.
PSA.109.9	Let his children be fatherless
PSA.109.9	And his wife a widow.
PSA.109.10	Let his children wander and beg;
PSA.109.10	Let them seek their food 
PSA.109.11	Let the creditor seize all that he has,
PSA.109.11	And let strangers plunder the product of his labor.
PSA.109.12	Let there be no one to extend kindness to him,
PSA.109.12	Nor let anyone be gracious to his fatherless children.
PSA.109.13	Let his descendants be cut off,
PSA.109.13	And in the following generation let their name be blotted out.
PSA.109.14	Let the wickedness of his fathers be remembered by the L
PSA.109.14	And do not let the sin of his mother be blotted out.
PSA.109.15	Let them be before the L
PSA.109.15	That He may cut off their memory from the earth;
PSA.109.16	Because the man did not remember to show kindness,
PSA.109.16	But persecuted the suffering and needy man,
PSA.109.16	And the brokenhearted, to put them to death.
PSA.109.17	He also loved cursing, and it came [back] to him;
PSA.109.17	He did not delight in blessing, so it was far from him.
PSA.109.18	He clothed himself with cursing as with his garment,
PSA.109.18	And it seeped into his inner self like water
PSA.109.18	And like [anointing] oil into his bones.
PSA.109.19	Let it be to him as a robe with which he covers himself,
PSA.109.19	And as a sash with which he is constantly bound.
PSA.109.20	Let this be the reward of my attackers from the L
PSA.109.20	And of those who speak evil against my life.
PSA.109.21	But You, O G
PSA.109.21	Because Your lovingkindness (faithfulness, compassion) is good, O rescue me;
PSA.109.22	For I am suffering and needy,
PSA.109.22	And my heart is wounded within me.
PSA.109.23	I am vanishing like a shadow when it lengthens

PSA.119.87	They had almost destroyed me on earth,
PSA.119.87	But as for me, I did not 
PSA.119.88	According to Your steadfast love refresh me 
PSA.119.88	So that I may keep 
PSA.119.89	Forever, O L
PSA.119.89	Your word is settled in heaven [standing firm and unchangeable].
PSA.119.90	Your faithfulness 
PSA.119.90	You have established the earth, and it stands [securely].
PSA.119.91	They continue this day according to Your ordinances,
PSA.119.91	For all things [all parts of the universe] are Your servants.
PSA.119.92	If Your law had not been my delight,
PSA.119.92	Then I would have perished in my time of trouble.
PSA.119.93	I will never forget Your precepts,
PSA.119.93	For by them You have revived me 
PSA.119.94	I am Yours, save me [as Your own];
PSA.119.94	For I have [diligently] sought Your precepts 
PSA.119.95	The wicked wait for me to destroy me,
PSA.119.95	But I will consider Your testimonies.
PSA.119.96	I have seen that all [human] perfection has its limits [no matter how grand and perfect and noble];
PSA.119.96	Your commandment is exceedingly broad 
PSA.119.97	Oh, how I love Your law!
PSA.119.97	It is my meditation all the day.
PSA.119.98	Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies,
PSA.119.98	For Your words are always with me.
PSA.119.99	I have better understanding 
PSA.119.99	For Your testimonies are my meditation.
PSA.119.100	I understand more than the aged [who have not observed Your precepts],
PSA.119.100	Because I have observed 
PSA.119.101	I have restrained my feet from every evil way,
PSA.119.101	That I may keep Your word.
PSA.119.102	I have not turned aside from Your ordinances,
PSA.119.102	For You Yourself have taught me.
PSA.119.103	How sweet are Your words to my taste,
PSA.119.104	From Your precepts I get understanding;
PSA.119.104	Therefore I hate every false way.
PSA.119.105	Your word is a lamp to my feet
PSA.119.105	And a light to my path.
PSA.119.106	I have sworn [an oath] and have confirmed it,
PSA.119.106	That I will keep Your righteous ordinances.
PSA.119.107	I am greatly afflicted;
PSA.119.107	Renew 
PSA.119.108	Accept 
PSA.119.108	And teach me Your ordinances.
PSA.119.109	My life is continually 
PSA.119.109	Yet I do not forget Your law.
PSA.119.110	The wicked have laid a snare for me,
PSA.119.110	Yet I do not wander from Your precepts.
PSA.119.111	I have taken Your testimonies as a heritage forever,
PSA.119.111	For they are the joy of my heart.
PSA.119.112	I have inclined my heart to perform Your statutes
PSA.119.112	Forever, even to the end.
PSA.119.113	I hate those who are double-minded,
PSA.119.113	But I love 
PSA.119.114	You are my hiding place and my shield;
PSA.119.114	I wait for Your word.
PSA.119.115	Leave me, you evildoers,
PSA.119.115	That I may keep the commandments of my God [honoring and obeying them].
PSA.119.116	Uphold me according to Your word [of promise], so that I may live;
PSA.119.116	And do not let me be ashamed of my hope [in Your great goodness].
PSA.119.117	Uphold me that I may be safe,
PSA.119.117	That I may have regard for Your statutes continually.
PSA.119.118	You have turned Your back on all those who wander from Your statutes,
PSA.119.118	For their deceitfulness is useless.
PSA.119.119	You have removed all the wicked of the earth like dross [for they have no value];
PSA.119.119	Therefore I love Your testimonies.
PSA.119.120	My flesh trembles in [reverent] fear of You,
PSA.119.120	And I am afraid 
PSA.119.121	I have done justice and righteousness;
PSA.119.121	Do not leave me to those who oppress me.
PSA.119.122	Be the guarantee for Your servant for good [as Judah was the guarantee for Benjamin];
PSA.119.122	Do not let the arrogant oppress me.
PSA.119.123	My eyes fail [with longing, watching] for [the fulfillment of] Your salvation,
PSA.119.123	And for [the fulfillment of] Your righteous word.
PSA.119.124	Deal with Your servant according to Your [gracious] lovingkindness,
PSA.119.124	And teach me Your statutes.
PSA.119.125	I am Your servant; give me understanding [the ability to learn and a teachable heart]
PSA.119.125	That I may know Your testimonies.
PSA.119.126	It is time for the L
PSA.119.126	They have broken Your law.
PSA.119.127	Therefore I love Your commandments more than gold,
PSA.119.127	Yes, more than refined gold.
PSA.119.128	Therefore I esteem as right all Your precepts concerning everything;
PSA.119.128	I hate every false way.
PSA.119.129	Your testimonies are wonderful;
PSA.119.129	Therefore my soul keeps them.
PSA.119.130	The unfolding of Your [glorious] words give light;
PSA.119.130	Their unfolding gives understanding to the simple (childlike).
PSA.119.131	I opened my mouth and panted [with anticipation],
PSA.119.131	Because I longed for Your commandments.
PSA.119.132	Turn to me and be gracious to me 
PSA.119.132	As is Your way to those who love Your name.
PSA.119.133	Establish my footsteps in [the way of] Your word;
PSA.119.133	Do not let any human weakness have power over me [causing me to be separated from You].
PSA.119.134	Redeem me from the oppression of man;
PSA.119.134	That I may keep Your precepts.
PSA.119.135	Make Your face shine [with pleasure] upon Your servant,
PSA.119.135	And teach me Your statutes.
PSA.119.136	My eyes weep streams of water
PSA.119.136	Because people do not keep Your law.
PSA.119.137	Righteous are You, O L
PSA.119.137	And upright are Your judgments.
PSA.119.138	You have commanded Your testimonies in righteousness
PSA.119.138	And in great faithfulness.
PSA.119.139	My zeal has [completely] consumed me,
PSA.119.139	Because my enemies have forgotten Your words.
PSA.119.140	Your word is very pure (refined);
PSA.119.140	Therefore Your servant loves it.
PSA.119.141	I am small and despised,
PSA.119.141	But I do not forget Your precepts.
PSA.119.142	Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness,
PSA.119.142	And Your law is truth.
PSA.119.143	Trouble and anguish have found me,
PSA.119.143	Yet Your commandments are my delight 
PSA.119.144	Your righteous testimonies are everlasting;
PSA.119.144	Give me understanding [the ability to learn and a teachable heart] that I may live.
PSA.119.145	I cried with all my heart; answer me, O L
PSA.119.145	I will observe Your statutes.
PSA.119.146	I cried to You; save me
PSA.119.146	And I will keep Your testimonies.
PSA.119.147	I rise before dawn and cry [in prayer] for help;
PSA.119.147	I wait for Your word.
PSA.119.148	My eyes anticipate the night watches 
PSA.119.148	That I may meditate on Your word.
PSA.119.149	Hear my voice according to Your [steadfast] lovingkindness;
PSA.119.149	O L
PSA.119.150	Those who follow after wickedness approach;
PSA.119.150	They are far from Your law.
PSA.119.151	You are near, O L
PSA.119.151	And all Your commandments are truth.
PSA.119.152	Of old I have known from Your testimonies
PSA.119.152	That You have founded them forever.
PSA.119.153	Look upon my agony and rescue me,
PSA.119.153	For I do not forget Your law.
PSA.119.154	Plead my cause and redeem me;
PSA.119.154	Revive me 
PSA.119.155	Salvation is far from the wicked,
PSA.119.155	For they do not seek Your statutes.

PSA.119.156	Revive me 
PSA.119.157	Many are my persecutors and my adversaries,
PSA.119.157	Yet I do not turn away from Your testimonies.
PSA.119.158	I see the treacherous and loathe them,
PSA.119.158	Because they do not respect Your law.
PSA.119.159	Consider how I love Your precepts;
PSA.119.159	Revive me 
PSA.119.160	The sum of Your word is truth [the full meaning of all Your precepts],
PSA.119.160	And every one of Your righteous ordinances endures forever.
PSA.119.161	Princes persecute me without cause,
PSA.119.161	But my heart stands in [reverent] awe of Your words [so I can expect You to help me].
PSA.119.162	I rejoice at Your word,
PSA.119.162	As one who finds great treasure.
PSA.119.163	I hate and detest falsehood,
PSA.119.163	But I love Your law.
PSA.119.164	Because of Your righteous ordinances.
PSA.119.165	Those who love Your law have great peace;
PSA.119.165	Nothing makes them stumble.
PSA.119.166	I hope 
PSA.119.166	And I do Your commandments.
PSA.119.167	My soul keeps Your testimonies [hearing and accepting and obeying them];
PSA.119.167	I love them greatly.
PSA.119.168	I keep Your precepts and Your testimonies,
PSA.119.168	For all my ways are [fully known] before You.
PSA.119.169	Let my [mournful] cry come before You, O L
PSA.119.169	Give me understanding [the ability to learn and a teachable heart] according to Your word [of promise].
PSA.119.170	Let my supplication come before You;
PSA.119.170	Deliver me according to Your word.
PSA.119.171	Let my lips speak praise [with thanksgiving],
PSA.119.171	For You teach me Your statutes.
PSA.119.172	Let my tongue sing [praise for the fulfillment] of Your word,
PSA.119.172	For all Your commandments are righteous.
PSA.119.173	Let Your hand be ready to help me,
PSA.119.173	For I have chosen Your precepts.
PSA.119.174	I long for Your salvation, O L
PSA.119.174	And Your law is my delight.
PSA.119.175	Let my soul live that it may praise You,
PSA.119.175	And let Your ordinances help me.
PSA.119.176	I have gone astray like a lost sheep;
PSA.119.176	Seek Your servant, for I do not forget Your commandments.
PSA.120.1	In my trouble I cried to the L
PSA.120.1	And He answered me.
PSA.120.2	Rescue my soul, O L
PSA.120.2	And from a deceitful tongue.
PSA.120.3	What shall be given to you, and what more shall be done to you,
PSA.120.3	You deceitful tongue?—

PSA.120.6	With those who hate peace.
PSA.120.7	I am for peace, but when I speak,
PSA.120.7	They are for war.

PSA.121.1	From where shall my help come?
PSA.121.2	My help comes from the L
PSA.121.2	Who made heaven and earth.

PSA.123.4	And with the contempt of the proud [who disregard God’s law].
PSA.124.1	“If it had not been the L

PSA.137.1	By the rivers of Babylon,

PSA.137.1	When we remembered Zion [the city God imprinted on our hearts].
PSA.137.2	On the willow trees in the midst of Babylon
PSA.137.2	We hung our harps.
PSA.137.3	For there they who took us captive demanded of us a song with words,
PSA.137.3	And our tormentors [who made a mockery of us demanded] amusement, 
PSA.137.3	“Sing us one of the songs of Zion.”
PSA.137.4	How can we sing the L
PSA.137.4	In a strange 
PSA.137.5	If I forget you, O Jerusalem,
PSA.137.5	Let my right hand forget [her skill with the harp].
PSA.137.6	Let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth
PSA.137.6	If I do not remember you,
PSA.137.6	If I do not prefer Jerusalem
PSA.137.6	Above my chief joy.
PSA.137.7	Remember, O L
PSA.137.7	The day of [the fall of] Jerusalem,
PSA.137.7	Who said “Down, down [with her]
PSA.137.7	To her very foundation.”
PSA.137.8	O daughter of Babylon, you devastator,
PSA.137.8	How blessed will be the one
PSA.137.8	Who repays you [with destruction] as you have repaid us.
PSA.137.9	How blessed will be the one who seizes and dashes your little ones
PSA.137.9	Against the rock.
PSA.138.1	I will give You thanks with all my heart;
PSA.138.1	I sing praises to You before the [pagan] gods.
PSA.138.2	I will bow down [in worship] toward Your holy temple
PSA.138.2	And give thanks to Your name for Your lovingkindness and Your truth;
PSA.138.2	For You have magnified Your word together with Your name.
PSA.138.3	On the day I called, You answered me;
PSA.138.3	And You made me bold 
PSA.138.4	All the kings of the land will give thanks 
PSA.138.4	When they have heard of the promises of Your mouth [which were fulfilled].
PSA.138.5	Yes, they will sing of the ways of the L
PSA.138.5	For great is the glory 
PSA.138.6	Though the L
PSA.138.6	He regards the lowly [and invites them into His fellowship];
PSA.138.6	But the proud 
PSA.138.7	Though I walk in the midst of trouble, You will revive me;
PSA.138.7	You will stretch out Your hand against the wrath of my enemies,
PSA.138.7	And Your right hand will save me.
PSA.138.8	The L
PSA.138.8	Your [unwavering] lovingkindness, O L
PSA.138.8	Do not abandon the works of Your own hands.
PSA.139.1	O L
PSA.139.2	You know when I sit down and when I rise up [my entire life, everything I do];
PSA.139.2	You understand my thought from afar.
PSA.139.3	You scrutinize my path and my lying down,
PSA.139.3	And You are intimately acquainted with all my ways.
PSA.139.4	Even before there is a word on my tongue [still unspoken],
PSA.139.4	Behold, O L
PSA.139.5	You have enclosed me behind and before,
PSA.139.5	And [You have] placed Your hand upon me.
PSA.139.6	Such [infinite] knowledge is too wonderful for me;
PSA.139.6	It is too high [above me], I cannot reach it.
PSA.139.7	Where can I go from Your Spirit?
PSA.139.7	Or where can I flee from Your presence?
PSA.139.8	If I ascend to heaven, You are there;
PSA.139.8	If I make my bed in Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead), behold, You are there.
PSA.139.9	If I take the wings of the dawn,
PSA.139.9	If I dwell in the remotest part of the sea,
PSA.139.10	Even there Your hand will lead me,
PSA.139.10	And Your right hand will take hold of me.
PSA.139.11	If I say, “Surely the darkness will cover me,
PSA.139.11	And the night will be the only light around me,”
PSA.139.12	Even the darkness is not dark to You 
PSA.139.12	But the night shines as bright as the day;
PSA.139.12	Darkness and light are alike 
PSA.139.13	For You formed my innermost parts;
PSA.139.13	You knit me [together] in my mother’s womb.
PSA.139.14	I will give thanks 
PSA.139.14	Wonderful are Your works,
PSA.139.14	And my soul knows it very well.
PSA.139.15	My frame was not hidden from You,
PSA.139.15	When I was being formed in secret,
PSA.139.15	And intricately 
PSA.139.16	Your eyes have seen my unformed substance;
PSA.139.16	And in Your book were all written
PSA.139.16	The days that were appointed 
PSA.139.16	When as yet there was not one of them [even taking shape].
PSA.139.17	How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God!
PSA.139.17	How vast is the sum of them!
PSA.139.18	If I could count them, they would outnumber the sand.
PSA.139.18	When I awake, I am still with You.
PSA.139.19	Go away from me, therefore, men of bloodshed.
PSA.139.20	For they speak against You wickedly,
PSA.139.20	Your enemies take 
PSA.139.21	Do I not hate those who hate You, O L
PSA.139.21	And do I not loathe those who rise up against You?
PSA.139.22	I hate them with perfect 
PSA.139.22	They have become my enemies.
PSA.139.23	Search me [thoroughly], O God, and know my heart;

PSA.139.24	And see if there is any wicked 
PSA.139.24	And lead me in the everlasting way.
PSA.140.1	Rescue me, O L
PSA.140.1	Protect me from violent men.
PSA.140.2	They devise evil things in their hearts;
PSA.140.2	They continually [gather together and] stir up wars.
PSA.140.3	They sharpen their tongues like a serpent’s;
PSA.140.3	Poison of a viper is under their lips. Selah.
PSA.140.4	Keep me, O L
PSA.140.4	Protect me from violent men
PSA.140.4	Who intend to trip up my steps.
PSA.140.5	The proud have hidden a trap for me, and cords;
PSA.140.5	They have spread a net by the wayside;
PSA.140.5	They have set traps for me. Selah.
PSA.140.6	I said to the L
PSA.140.6	Listen to the voice of my supplications, O L
PSA.140.7	O G
PSA.140.7	You have covered my head in the day of battle.
PSA.140.8	Do not grant, O L
PSA.140.8	Do not further their evil device, that they not be exalted. Selah.
PSA.140.9	“Those who surround me raise their heads;
PSA.140.9	May the mischief of their own lips come upon them.
PSA.140.10	Let burning coals fall upon them;
PSA.140.10	Let them be thrown into the fire,
PSA.140.10	Into deep [water] pits from which they cannot rise.
PSA.140.11	Do not let a slanderer be established in the earth;
PSA.140.11	Let evil quickly hunt the violent man [to overthrow him and stop his evil acts].”
PSA.140.12	I know [with confidence] that the L
PSA.140.12	And [will secure] justice for the poor.
PSA.140.13	Surely the righteous will give thanks to Your name;
PSA.140.13	The upright will dwell in Your presence.
PSA.141.1	L
PSA.141.1	Listen to my voice when I call to You.
PSA.141.2	Let my prayer be counted as incense before You;
PSA.141.2	The lifting up of my hands as the evening offering.
PSA.141.3	Set a guard, O L
PSA.141.3	Keep watch over the door of my lips [to keep me from speaking thoughtlessly].
PSA.141.4	Do not incline my heart to [consent to or tolerate] any evil thing,
PSA.141.4	Or to practice deeds of wickedness
PSA.141.4	With men who plan 
PSA.141.4	And let me not eat of their delicacies (be tempted by their gain).
PSA.141.5	Let the righteous [thoughtfully] strike (correct) me—it is a kindness [done to encourage my spiritual maturity].
PSA.141.5	It is [the choicest anointing] oil on the head;
PSA.141.5	Let my head not refuse [to accept and acknowledge and learn from] it;
PSA.141.5	For still my prayer is against their wicked deeds.
PSA.141.6	Their [wicked, godless] judges are thrown down the sides of the rocky cliff,
PSA.141.6	And they [who followed them] will hear my words, for they are pleasant (just).
PSA.141.7	As when the one plows and breaks open the ground [and the soil scatters behind him],
PSA.141.7	Our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol [by the injustices of the wicked].
PSA.141.8	For my eyes are toward You, O G
PSA.141.8	In You I take refuge; do not pour out my life 
PSA.141.9	Keep me from the jaws of the trap which they have set for me,
PSA.141.9	And from the snares of those who do evil.
PSA.141.10	Let the wicked fall into their own nets,
PSA.141.10	While I pass by 
PSA.142.1	I cry aloud with my voice to the L
PSA.142.1	I make supplication with my voice to the L
PSA.142.2	I pour out my complaint before Him;
PSA.142.2	I declare my trouble before Him.
PSA.142.3	When my spirit was overwhelmed 
PSA.142.3	You knew my path.
PSA.142.3	In the way where I walk
PSA.142.3	They have hidden a trap for me.
PSA.142.4	Look to the right [the point of attack] and see;
PSA.142.4	For there is no one who has regard for me [to act in my favor].
PSA.142.4	Escape has failed me 
PSA.142.4	No one cares about my life.
PSA.142.5	I cried out to You, O L
PSA.142.5	I said, “You are my refuge,
PSA.142.5	My portion in the land of the living.
PSA.142.6	Give attention to my cry,
PSA.142.6	For I am brought very low;
PSA.142.6	Rescue me from my persecutors,
PSA.142.6	For they are stronger than I.
PSA.142.7	Bring my soul out of prison (adversity),
PSA.142.7	So that I may give thanks 
PSA.142.7	The righteous will surround me [in triumph],
PSA.142.7	For You will look after me.”
PSA.143.1	Hear my prayer, O L
PSA.143.1	Listen to my supplications!
PSA.143.1	Answer me in Your faithfulness, and in Your righteousness.
PSA.143.2	And do not enter into judgment with Your servant,
PSA.143.2	For in Your sight no man living is righteous 
PSA.143.3	For the enemy has persecuted me,
PSA.143.3	He has crushed my life down to the ground;
PSA.143.3	He has made me dwell in dark places, like those who have been long dead.
PSA.143.4	Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed 
PSA.143.4	My heart grows numb within me.
PSA.143.5	I remember the days of old;
PSA.143.5	I meditate on all that You have done;
PSA.143.5	I ponder the work of Your hands.
PSA.143.6	I reach out my hands to You;
PSA.143.6	My throat 
PSA.143.7	Answer me quickly, O L
PSA.143.7	Do not hide Your face from me,
PSA.143.7	Or I will become like those who go down into the pit (grave).
PSA.143.8	Let me hear Your lovingkindness in the morning,
PSA.143.8	For I trust in You.
PSA.143.8	Teach me the way in which I should walk,
PSA.143.8	For I lift up my soul to You.
PSA.143.9	Rescue me, O L
PSA.143.9	I take refuge in You.
PSA.143.10	Teach me to do Your will [so that I may please You],
PSA.143.10	For You are my God;
PSA.143.10	Let Your good Spirit lead me on level ground.
PSA.143.11	Save my life, O L
PSA.143.11	In Your righteousness bring my life out of trouble.
PSA.143.12	In your lovingkindness, silence 
PSA.143.12	And destroy all those who afflict my life,
PSA.143.12	For I am Your servant.
PSA.144.1	Blessed be the L
PSA.144.1	Who trains my hands for war
PSA.144.1	And my fingers for battle;
PSA.144.2	My [steadfast] lovingkindness and my fortress,
PSA.144.2	My high tower and my rescuer,
PSA.144.2	My shield and He in whom I take refuge,
PSA.144.2	Who subdues my people under me.
PSA.144.3	L
PSA.144.3	Or the son of man that You think of him?
PSA.144.4	Man is like a mere breath;

PSA.144.9	I will sing a new song to You, O God;
PSA.144.9	Upon a harp of ten strings I will sing praises to You,
PSA.144.10	Who gives salvation to kings,
PSA.144.10	Who sets David His servant free from the evil sword.
PSA.144.11	Set me free and rescue me from the hand of [hostile] foreigners,
PSA.144.11	Whose mouth speaks deceit [without restraint],
PSA.144.11	And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
PSA.144.12	Let our sons in their youth be like plants full grown,

PRO.1.1	The proverbs (truths obscurely expressed, maxims) of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:
PRO.1.2	To know [skillful and godly] wisdom and instruction;
PRO.1.2	To discern 
PRO.1.3	To receive instruction in wise behavior 
PRO.1.3	Righteousness, justice, and integrity;
PRO.1.4	That prudence (good judgment, astute common sense) may be given to the naive 
PRO.1.4	And knowledge and discretion (intelligent discernment) to the youth,
PRO.1.5	The wise will hear and increase their learning,
PRO.1.5	And the person of understanding will acquire wise counsel 
PRO.1.6	To understand a proverb and a figure [of speech] 
PRO.1.6	And the words of the wise and their riddles [that require reflection].
PRO.1.7	The [reverent] fear of the L
PRO.1.8	My son, hear the instruction of your father,
PRO.1.8	And do not reject the teaching of your mother.
PRO.1.9	For they are a garland of grace on your head,
PRO.1.9	And chains 
PRO.1.10	My son, if sinners entice you,
PRO.1.10	Do not consent.
PRO.1.11	If they say, “Come with us;
PRO.1.11	Let us lie in wait to 
PRO.1.11	Let us ambush the innocent without cause;
PRO.1.12	Let us swallow them alive like Sheol (the place of the dead),

PRO.1.13	We will find 
PRO.1.13	We will fill our houses with spoil;
PRO.1.14	Throw in your lot with us [they insist];
PRO.1.14	We will all have one money bag [in common],”
PRO.1.15	My son, do not walk on the road with them;
PRO.1.15	Keep your foot [far] away from their path,
PRO.1.16	For their feet run to evil,
PRO.1.16	And they hurry to shed blood.
PRO.1.17	Indeed, it is useless to spread the 
PRO.1.17	In the sight of any bird;
PRO.1.18	But [when these people set a trap for others] they lie in wait for their own blood;
PRO.1.18	They set an ambush for their own lives [and rush to their destruction].
PRO.1.19	So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain;
PRO.1.19	Greed takes away the lives of its possessors.
PRO.1.20	She raises her voice in the markets;
PRO.1.21	She calls out at the head of the noisy streets [where large crowds gather];
PRO.1.21	At the entrance of the city gates she speaks her words:
PRO.1.22	“How long, O naive ones [you who are easily misled], will you love being simple-minded 
PRO.1.23	If you will turn 
PRO.1.23	Behold, I [Wisdom] will pour out my spirit on you;
PRO.1.23	I will make my words known to you.
PRO.1.24	Because I called and you refused [to answer],
PRO.1.24	I stretched out my hand and no one has paid attention [to my offer];
PRO.1.25	And you treated all my counsel as nothing
PRO.1.25	And would not accept my reprimand,

PRO.1.28	Then they will call upon me (Wisdom), but I will not answer;
PRO.1.28	They will seek me eagerly but they will not find me,
PRO.1.29	Because they hated knowledge
PRO.1.29	And did not choose the fear of the L
PRO.1.30	They would not accept my counsel,
PRO.1.30	And they spurned all my rebuke.
PRO.1.31	Therefore they shall eat of the fruit of their own [wicked] way

PRO.1.33	But whoever listens to me (Wisdom) will live securely 
PRO.1.33	And will be at ease, without fear 
PRO.2.1	My son, if you will receive my words
PRO.2.1	And treasure my commandments within you,
PRO.2.2	So that your ear is attentive to [skillful and godly] wisdom,
PRO.2.2	And apply your heart to understanding [seeking it conscientiously and striving for it eagerly];
PRO.2.3	Yes, if you cry out for insight,
PRO.2.3	And lift up your voice for understanding;
PRO.2.4	If you seek skillful 
PRO.2.4	And search for her as you would hidden treasures;
PRO.2.5	Then you will understand the [reverent] fear of the L
PRO.2.5	And discover the knowledge of God.
PRO.2.6	For the L
PRO.2.6	From His mouth come knowledge and understanding.
PRO.2.7	He stores away sound wisdom for the righteous [those who are in right standing with Him];
PRO.2.8	He guards the paths of justice;
PRO.2.8	And He preserves the way of His saints (believers).
PRO.2.9	Then you will understand righteousness and justice [in every circumstance]
PRO.2.9	And integrity and every good path.
PRO.2.10	For [skillful and godly] wisdom will enter your heart
PRO.2.10	And knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.
PRO.2.11	Discretion will watch over you,
PRO.2.11	Understanding 
PRO.2.12	To keep you from the way of evil 
PRO.2.12	From the man who speaks perverse things;
PRO.2.13	From those who leave the paths of uprightness
PRO.2.13	To walk in the ways of darkness;
PRO.2.14	Who find joy in doing evil
PRO.2.14	And delight in the perversity of evil,
PRO.2.15	Whose paths are crooked,
PRO.2.15	And who are devious in their ways;
PRO.2.16	To keep you from the immoral woman;
PRO.2.16	From the seductress with her flattering words,
PRO.2.17	Who leaves the companion (husband) of her youth,
PRO.2.17	And forgets the covenant of her God.
PRO.2.18	For her house leads down to death
PRO.2.18	And her paths lead to the dead;
PRO.2.19	None who go to her return again,
PRO.2.19	Nor do they regain the paths of life—
PRO.2.20	So you will walk in the way of good men [that is, those of personal integrity, moral courage and honorable character],
PRO.2.20	And keep to the paths of the righteous.
PRO.2.21	For the upright [those who are in right standing with God] will live in the land
PRO.2.21	And those [of integrity] who are blameless [in God’s sight] will remain in it;
PRO.2.22	But the wicked will be cut off from the land
PRO.2.22	And the treacherous shall be [forcibly] uprooted 
PRO.3.1	My son, do not forget my 
PRO.3.1	But let your heart keep my commandments;
PRO.3.2	For length of days and years of life [worth living]

PRO.3.10	And your vats will overflow with new wine.
PRO.3.11	My son, do not reject 
PRO.3.11	Nor despise His rebuke,
PRO.3.12	For those whom the L
PRO.3.12	Even as a father 
PRO.3.13	Happy [blessed, considered fortunate, to be admired] is the man who finds [skillful and godly] wisdom,
PRO.3.13	And the man who gains understanding 
PRO.3.14	For wisdom’s profit is better than the profit of silver,
PRO.3.14	And her gain is better than fine gold.
PRO.3.15	She is more precious than rubies;
PRO.3.15	And nothing you can wish for compares with her [in value].
PRO.3.16	Long life is in her right hand;
PRO.3.16	In her left hand are riches and honor.
PRO.3.17	Her ways are highways of pleasantness 
PRO.3.17	And all her paths are peace.
PRO.3.18	She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her,

PRO.3.20	And the clouds drip with dew.
PRO.3.21	My son, let them not escape from your sight,
PRO.3.21	But keep sound wisdom and discretion,
PRO.3.22	And they will be life to your soul (your inner self)
PRO.3.22	And a gracious adornment to your neck (your outer self).
PRO.3.23	Then you will walk on your way [of life] securely
PRO.3.23	And your foot will not stumble.
PRO.3.24	When you lie down, you will not be afraid;
PRO.3.24	When you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.
PRO.3.25	Do not be afraid of sudden fear
PRO.3.25	Nor of the storm of the wicked when it comes [since you will be blameless];
PRO.3.26	For the L
PRO.3.26	And will keep your foot from being caught [in a trap].
PRO.3.27	When it is in your power to do it.
PRO.3.28	Do not say to your neighbor, “Go, and come back,
PRO.3.28	And tomorrow I will give it,”
PRO.3.28	When you have it with you.
PRO.3.29	Do not devise evil against your neighbor,
PRO.3.29	Who lives securely beside you.
PRO.3.30	Do not quarrel with a man without cause,
PRO.3.30	If he has done you no harm.
PRO.3.31	Do not envy a man of violence
PRO.3.31	And do not choose any of his ways.
PRO.3.32	For the devious are repulsive to the L
PRO.3.32	But His private counsel is with the upright [those with spiritual integrity and moral courage].
PRO.3.33	The curse of the L
PRO.3.33	But He blesses the home of the just 
PRO.3.34	Though He scoffs at the scoffers 
PRO.3.34	Yet He gives His grace [His undeserved favor] to the humble [those who give up self-importance].
PRO.3.35	The wise will inherit honor 
PRO.3.35	But dishonor 
PRO.4.1	Hear, O children, the instruction of a father,
PRO.4.1	And pay attention [and be willing to learn] so that you may gain understanding 
PRO.4.2	For I give you good doctrine;
PRO.4.2	Do not 
PRO.4.3	When I was a son with my father (David),
PRO.4.3	Tender and the only son in the sight of my mother (Bathsheba),
PRO.4.4	He taught me and said to me,
PRO.4.4	“Let your heart hold fast my words;
PRO.4.4	Keep my commandments and live.
PRO.4.5	Get [skillful and godly] wisdom! Acquire understanding [actively seek spiritual discernment, mature comprehension, and logical interpretation]!
PRO.4.5	Do not forget nor turn away from the words of my mouth.
PRO.4.6	Do not 
PRO.4.6	Love her, and she will watch over you.
PRO.4.7	The beginning of wisdom is: Get [skillful and godly] wisdom [it is preeminent]!
PRO.4.7	And with all your acquiring, get understanding [actively seek spiritual discernment, mature comprehension, and logical interpretation].
PRO.4.8	Prize wisdom [and exalt her], and she will exalt you;
PRO.4.8	She will honor you if you embrace her.
PRO.4.9	She will place on your head a garland of grace;
PRO.4.9	She will present you with a crown of beauty 
PRO.4.10	Hear, my son, and accept my sayings,
PRO.4.10	And the years of your life will be many.
PRO.4.11	I have instructed you in the way of [skillful and godly] wisdom;
PRO.4.11	I have led you in upright paths.
PRO.4.12	When you walk, your steps will not be impeded [for your path will be clear and open];
PRO.4.12	And when you run, you will not stumble.
PRO.4.13	Take hold of instruction; [actively seek it, grip it firmly and] do not let go.
PRO.4.13	Guard her, for she is your life.
PRO.4.14	Do not enter the path of the wicked,
PRO.4.14	And do not go the way of evil men.
PRO.4.15	Avoid it, do not travel on it;
PRO.4.15	Turn away from it and pass on.
PRO.4.16	For the wicked cannot sleep unless they do evil;
PRO.4.16	And they are deprived of sleep unless they make someone stumble 
PRO.4.17	For they eat the bread of wickedness
PRO.4.17	And drink the wine of violence.
PRO.4.18	But the path of the just (righteous) is like the light of dawn,
PRO.4.18	That shines brighter and brighter until [it reaches its full strength and glory in] the perfect day.
PRO.4.19	The way of the wicked is like [deep] darkness;
PRO.4.19	They do not know over what they stumble.
PRO.4.20	My son, pay attention to my words 
PRO.4.20	Open your ears to my sayings.
PRO.4.21	Do not let them escape from your sight;
PRO.4.21	Keep them in the center of your heart.
PRO.4.22	For they are life to those who find them,
PRO.4.22	And healing 
PRO.4.23	Watch over your heart with all diligence,
PRO.4.23	For from it 
PRO.4.24	Put away from you a deceitful (lying, misleading) mouth,
PRO.4.24	And put devious lips far from you.
PRO.4.25	Let your eyes look directly ahead [toward the path of moral courage]
PRO.4.25	And let your gaze be fixed straight in front of you [toward the path of integrity].
PRO.4.26	Consider well 
PRO.4.26	And all your ways will be steadfast 
PRO.4.27	Do not turn away to the right nor to the left [where evil may lurk];
PRO.4.27	Turn your foot from [the path of] evil.
PRO.5.1	My son, be attentive to my wisdom [godly wisdom learned by costly experience],
PRO.5.1	Incline your ear to my understanding;
PRO.5.2	That you may exercise discrimination 
PRO.5.2	And your lips may reserve knowledge 
PRO.5.3	For the lips of an immoral woman drip honey [like a honeycomb]
PRO.5.3	And her speech is smoother than oil;
PRO.5.4	But in the end she is bitter like [the extract of] wormwood,
PRO.5.4	Sharp as a two-edged sword.
PRO.5.5	Her feet go down to death;
PRO.5.5	Her steps take hold of Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead),
PRO.5.6	So that she does not think [seriously] about the path of life;
PRO.5.6	Her ways are aimless 
PRO.5.7	Now then, my sons, listen to me
PRO.5.7	And do not depart from (forget) the words of my mouth.
PRO.5.8	Let your way [in life] be far from her,
PRO.5.8	And do not go near the door of her house [avoid even being near the places of temptation],
PRO.5.9	Or you will give your honor to others,
PRO.5.9	And your years to the cruel one,
PRO.5.10	And strangers will be filled with your strength
PRO.5.10	And your hard-earned wealth will go to the house of a foreigner [who does not know God];
PRO.5.11	And you will groan when your 
PRO.5.11	When your flesh and your body are consumed;
PRO.5.12	And you say, “How I hated instruction 
PRO.5.12	And my heart despised correction 
PRO.5.13	I have not listened to the voice of my teachers,
PRO.5.13	Nor have I inclined my ear to those who instructed me.
PRO.5.14	I was almost in total ruin
PRO.5.14	In the midst of the assembly and congregation.”
PRO.5.15	And fresh running water from your own well.
PRO.5.16	Should your 
PRO.5.16	As streams of water in the streets?
PRO.5.17	[Confine yourself to your own wife.] Let 
PRO.5.17	And not 
PRO.5.18	Let your fountain (wife) be blessed [with the rewards of fidelity],
PRO.5.18	And rejoice in the wife of your youth.
PRO.5.19	Let her breasts refresh 
PRO.5.19	Always be 
PRO.5.20	Why should you, my son, be exhilarated with an immoral woman
PRO.5.20	And embrace the bosom of an outsider (pagan)?
PRO.5.21	For the ways of man are directly before the eyes of the L
PRO.5.21	And He carefully watches all of his paths [all of his comings and goings].
PRO.5.22	The iniquities done by a wicked man will trap him,
PRO.5.22	And he will be held with the cords of his sin.
PRO.5.23	He will die for lack of instruction (discipline),
PRO.5.23	And in the greatness of his foolishness he will go astray 
PRO.6.1	My son, if you have become surety (guaranteed a debt or obligation) for your neighbor,
PRO.6.1	If you have given your pledge for [the debt of] a stranger 
PRO.6.2	If you have been snared with the words of your lips,
PRO.6.2	If you have been trapped by the speech of your mouth,
PRO.6.3	Do this now, my son, and release yourself [from the obligation];
PRO.6.3	Go humble yourself, and plead with your neighbor [to pay his debt and release you].
PRO.6.4	Give no [unnecessary] sleep to your eyes,
PRO.6.4	Nor slumber to your eyelids;
PRO.6.5	Tear yourself away like a gazelle from the hand of 
PRO.6.5	And like a bird from the hand of the fowler.
PRO.6.6	Go to the ant, O lazy one;
PRO.6.6	Observe her ways and be wise,
PRO.6.7	Which, having no chief,
PRO.6.7	Overseer or ruler,
PRO.6.8	She prepares her food in the summer
PRO.6.8	And brings in her provisions [of food for the winter] in the harvest.
PRO.6.9	How long will you lie down, O lazy one?
PRO.6.9	When will you arise from your sleep [and learn self-discipline]?
PRO.6.10	“Yet a little sleep, a little slumber,
PRO.6.10	A little folding of the hands to lie down 
PRO.6.11	So your poverty will come like an 
PRO.6.11	And your need [will come] like an armed man [making you helpless].
PRO.6.12	A worthless person, a wicked man,
PRO.6.12	Is one who walks with a perverse (corrupt, vulgar) mouth.
PRO.6.13	Who winks with his eyes [in mockery], who shuffles his feet [to signal],
PRO.6.13	Who points with his fingers [to give subversive instruction];
PRO.6.14	Who perversely in his heart plots trouble 
PRO.6.14	Who spreads discord 
PRO.6.15	Therefore [the crushing weight of] his disaster will come suddenly 
PRO.6.15	Instantly he will be broken, and there will be no healing 
PRO.6.16	These six things the L
PRO.6.16	Indeed, seven are repulsive to Him:
PRO.6.17	A proud look [the attitude that makes one overestimate oneself and discount others], a lying tongue,
PRO.6.17	And hands that shed innocent blood,
PRO.6.18	A heart that creates wicked plans,
PRO.6.18	Feet that run swiftly to evil,
PRO.6.19	A false witness who breathes out lies [even half-truths],
PRO.6.19	And one who spreads discord (rumors) among brothers.
PRO.6.20	My son, be guided by your father’s [God-given] commandment (instruction)
PRO.6.20	And do not 
PRO.6.21	Bind them continually upon your heart (in your thoughts),
PRO.6.21	And tie them around your neck.
PRO.6.22	When you walk about, they (the godly teachings of your parents) will guide you;
PRO.6.22	When you sleep, they will keep watch over you;
PRO.6.22	And when you awake, they will talk to you.
PRO.6.23	For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching [of the law] is light,
PRO.6.23	And reproofs (rebukes) for discipline are the way of life,
PRO.6.24	To keep you from the evil woman,
PRO.6.24	From [the flattery of] the smooth tongue of an immoral woman.
PRO.6.25	Do not desire (lust after) her beauty in your heart,
PRO.6.25	Nor let her capture you with her eyelashes.
PRO.6.26	For on account of a prostitute one is reduced to a piece of bread [to be eaten up],
PRO.6.26	And the immoral woman hunts [with a hook] the precious life [of a man].
PRO.6.27	Can a man take fire to his chest
PRO.6.27	And his clothes not be burned?
PRO.6.28	Or can a man walk on hot coals
PRO.6.28	And his feet not be scorched?
PRO.6.29	So is the one who goes in to his neighbor’s wife;
PRO.6.29	Whoever touches her will not be found innocent 
PRO.6.30	People do not despise a thief if he steals
PRO.6.30	To satisfy himself when he is hungry;
PRO.6.31	But when he is found, he must repay seven times [what he stole];
PRO.6.31	He must give all the property of his house [if necessary to meet his fine].
PRO.6.32	But whoever commits adultery with a woman lacks common sense 
PRO.6.32	He who would destroy his soul does it.
PRO.6.33	Wounds and disgrace he will find,
PRO.6.33	And his reproach (blame) will not be blotted out.
PRO.6.34	For jealousy enrages the [wronged] husband;
PRO.6.34	He will not spare [the guilty one] on the day of vengeance.
PRO.6.35	He will not accept any ransom [offered to buy him off from demanding full punishment];
PRO.6.35	Nor will he be satisfied though you offer him many gifts (bribes).
PRO.7.1	My son, keep my words
PRO.7.1	And treasure my commandments within you [so they are readily available to guide you].
PRO.7.2	Keep my commandments and live,
PRO.7.2	And keep my teaching 
PRO.7.3	Bind them [securely] on your fingers;
PRO.7.3	Write them on the tablet of your heart.
PRO.7.4	Say to [skillful and godly] wisdom, “You are my sister,”
PRO.7.4	And regard understanding 
PRO.7.5	That they may keep you from the immoral woman,
PRO.7.5	From the foreigner [who does not observe God’s laws and] who flatters with her [smooth] words.
PRO.7.6	For at the window of my house
PRO.7.6	I looked out through my lattice.
PRO.7.7	And among the naive [the inexperienced and gullible],
PRO.7.7	I saw among the youths
PRO.7.7	A young man lacking [good] sense,
PRO.7.8	Passing through the street near her corner;
PRO.7.8	And he took the path to her house
PRO.7.9	In the twilight, in the evening;
PRO.7.9	In the black and dark night.
PRO.7.10	And there a woman met him,
PRO.7.10	Dressed as a prostitute and sly 
PRO.7.11	She was boisterous and rebellious;
PRO.7.12	At times 
PRO.7.12	Lurking 
PRO.7.13	So she caught him and kissed him
PRO.7.13	And with a brazen 
PRO.7.14	“I have peace offerings with me;
PRO.7.14	Today I have paid my vows.
PRO.7.15	So I came out to meet you [that you might share with me the feast of my offering],
PRO.7.15	Diligently I sought your face and I have found you.
PRO.7.16	I have spread my couch with coverings 
PRO.7.16	With colored fine linen of Egypt.
PRO.7.17	I have perfumed my bed
PRO.7.17	With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
PRO.7.18	Come, let us drink our fill of love until morning;
PRO.7.18	Let us console 
PRO.7.19	For my husband is not at home.
PRO.7.19	He has gone on a long journey;
PRO.7.20	He has taken a bag of money with him,
PRO.7.20	And he will come home on the appointed day.”
PRO.7.21	With her many persuasions she caused him to yield;
PRO.7.21	With her flattering lips she seduced him.
PRO.7.22	Suddenly he went after her, as an ox goes to the slaughter [not knowing the outcome],
PRO.7.22	Or as one in stocks going to the correction [to be given] to a fool,
PRO.7.23	Until an arrow pierced his liver [with a mortal wound];
PRO.7.23	Like a bird fluttering straight into the net,
PRO.7.23	He did not know that it 
PRO.7.24	Now therefore, my sons, listen to me,
PRO.7.24	And pay attention to the words of my mouth.
PRO.7.25	Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways,
PRO.7.25	Do not stray into her [evil, immoral] paths.
PRO.7.26	For she has cast down many [mortally] wounded;
PRO.7.26	Indeed, all who were killed by her were strong.
PRO.7.27	Her house is the way to 
PRO.7.27	Descending to the chambers of death.
PRO.8.1	Does not wisdom call,
PRO.8.1	And understanding lift up her voice?
PRO.8.2	On the top of the heights beside the way,
PRO.8.2	Where the paths meet, wisdom takes her stand;
PRO.8.3	Beside the gates, at the entrance to the city,
PRO.8.3	At the entrance of the doors, she cries out:
PRO.8.4	“To you, O men, I call,
PRO.8.4	And my voice is directed to the sons of men.
PRO.8.5	O you naive 
PRO.8.5	And, O you [closed-minded, self-confident] fools, understand wisdom [seek the insight and self-discipline that leads to godly living].
PRO.8.6	Listen, for I will speak excellent 
PRO.8.6	And the opening of my lips 
PRO.8.7	For my mouth will utter truth,
PRO.8.7	And wickedness is repulsive 
PRO.8.8	All the words of my mouth are in righteousness (upright, in right standing with God);
PRO.8.8	There is nothing contrary to truth or perverted (crooked) in them.
PRO.8.9	They are all straightforward to him who understands [with an open and willing mind],
PRO.8.9	And right to those who find knowledge 
PRO.8.10	Take my instruction rather than [seeking] silver,
PRO.8.10	And take knowledge rather than choicest gold,
PRO.8.11	For wisdom is better than rubies;
PRO.8.11	And all desirable things cannot compare with her.
PRO.8.12	“I, [godly] wisdom, reside with prudence [good judgment, moral courage and astute common sense],
PRO.8.12	And I find knowledge and discretion.
PRO.8.13	The [reverent] fear 
PRO.8.13	Pride and arrogance and the evil way,
PRO.8.13	And the perverted mouth, I hate.
PRO.8.14	Counsel is mine and sound wisdom;
PRO.8.14	I am understanding, power 
PRO.8.15	By me kings reign
PRO.8.15	And rulers decide 
PRO.8.16	By me princes rule, and nobles,
PRO.8.16	All who judge 
PRO.8.17	I love those who love me;
PRO.8.17	And those who seek me early 
PRO.8.18	Riches and honor are with me,
PRO.8.18	Enduring wealth and righteousness (right standing with God).
PRO.8.19	My fruit is better than gold, even pure gold,
PRO.8.19	And my yield is better than choicest silver.
PRO.8.20	I, [Wisdom, continuously] walk in the way of righteousness,
PRO.8.20	In the midst of the paths of justice,
PRO.8.21	That I may cause those who love me to inherit wealth 
PRO.8.21	And that I may fill their treasuries.

PRO.8.22	Before His works of old [were accomplished].
PRO.8.23	From everlasting I was established 
PRO.8.23	From the beginning, before the earth existed, [I, godly wisdom, existed].
PRO.8.24	When there were no ocean depths I was born,
PRO.8.24	When there were no fountains 
PRO.8.25	Before the mountains were settled,
PRO.8.25	Before the hills, I was born;
PRO.8.26	While He had not yet made the earth and the fields,
PRO.8.26	Or the first of the dust of the earth.
PRO.8.27	When He established the heavens, I [Wisdom] was there;
PRO.8.27	When He drew a circle upon the face of the deep,
PRO.8.28	When He made firm the skies above,
PRO.8.28	When the fountains and springs of the deep became fixed 
PRO.8.29	When He set for the sea its boundary
PRO.8.29	So that the waters would not transgress [the boundaries set by] His command,
PRO.8.29	When He marked out the foundations of the earth—
PRO.8.30	Then I was beside Him, as a master craftsman;
PRO.8.30	And I was daily His delight;
PRO.8.30	Rejoicing before Him always,
PRO.8.31	Rejoicing in the world, His inhabited earth,
PRO.8.31	And having my delight in the sons of men.
PRO.8.32	“Now therefore, O sons, listen to me,
PRO.8.32	For blessed [happy, prosperous, to be admired] are they who keep my ways.
PRO.8.33	Heed (pay attention to) instruction and be wise,
PRO.8.33	And do not ignore 
PRO.8.34	Blessed [happy, prosperous, to be admired] is the man who listens to me,
PRO.8.34	Watching daily at my gates,
PRO.8.34	Waiting at my doorposts.
PRO.8.35	For whoever finds me (Wisdom) finds life
PRO.8.35	And obtains favor 
PRO.8.36	But he who fails to find me 
PRO.8.36	All those who hate me love 
PRO.9.1	Wisdom has built her [spacious and sufficient] house;

PRO.9.12	If you scoff [thoughtlessly ridicule and disdain], you alone will pay the penalty.
PRO.9.13	The foolish woman is restless 
PRO.9.13	She is naive 
PRO.9.14	She sits at the doorway of her house,
PRO.9.14	On a seat by the high

PRO.10.9	He who walks in integrity 
PRO.10.9	But he who takes a crooked way will be discovered 
PRO.10.10	He who [maliciously] winks the eye [of evil intent] causes trouble;
PRO.10.10	And the babbling fool [who is arrogant and thinks himself wise] will come to ruin.
PRO.10.11	The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life 
PRO.10.11	But the mouth of the wicked conceals violence 
PRO.10.12	Hatred stirs up strife,
PRO.10.12	But love covers 
PRO.10.13	On the lips of the discerning, [skillful and godly] wisdom is found,
PRO.10.13	But discipline 
PRO.10.14	Wise men store up 
PRO.10.14	But with the mouth of the foolish, ruin is at hand.
PRO.10.15	The rich man’s wealth is his fortress;
PRO.10.15	The ruin of the poor is their poverty.
PRO.10.16	The wages of the righteous [the upright, those in right standing with God] is [a worthwhile, meaningful] life,
PRO.10.16	The income of the wicked, punishment.
PRO.10.17	He who learns from instruction 
PRO.10.17	But he who ignores 
PRO.10.18	He who hides hatred has lying lips,
PRO.10.18	And he who spreads slander is a fool.
PRO.10.19	When there are many words, transgression

PRO.10.20	The tongue of the righteous is like precious silver (greatly valued);
PRO.10.20	The heart of the wicked is worth little.

PRO.10.25	When the whirlwind passes, the wicked is no more,

PRO.10.29	But it is ruin to those who do evil.
PRO.10.30	The [consistently] righteous will never be shaken,
PRO.10.30	But the wicked will not inhabit the earth.
PRO.10.31	The mouth of the righteous flows with [skillful and godly] wisdom,
PRO.10.31	But the perverted tongue will be cut out.
PRO.10.32	The lips of the righteous know (speak) what is acceptable,
PRO.10.32	But the mouth of the wicked knows (speaks) what is perverted (twisted).
PRO.11.1	A false balance

PRO.11.6	The righteousness of the upright will rescue them,
PRO.11.6	But the treacherous will be caught by their own greed.
PRO.11.7	When the wicked man dies, his expectation will perish;
PRO.11.7	And the hope of [godless] strong men perishes.
PRO.11.8	And the wicked takes his place.

PRO.11.9	But through knowledge 
PRO.11.10	When it goes well for the righteous, the city rejoices,
PRO.11.10	And when the wicked perish, there are shouts of joy.
PRO.11.11	By the blessing [of the influence] of the upright the city is exalted,
PRO.11.11	But by the mouth of the wicked it is torn down.
PRO.11.12	He who despises his neighbor lacks sense,
PRO.11.12	But a man of understanding keeps silent.
PRO.11.13	He who goes about as a gossip reveals secrets,
PRO.11.13	But he who is trustworthy 
PRO.11.14	Where there is no [wise, intelligent] guidance, the people fall [and go off course like a ship without a helm],
PRO.11.14	But in the abundance of [wise and godly] counselors there is victory.

PRO.11.18	The wicked man earns deceptive wages,
PRO.11.18	But he who sows righteousness 
PRO.11.19	He who is steadfast in righteousness 
PRO.11.19	But he who pursues evil 
PRO.11.20	The perverse in heart are repulsive 
PRO.11.20	But those who are blameless 
PRO.11.21	Assuredly, the evil man will not go unpunished,
PRO.11.21	But the descendants of the righteous will be freed.
PRO.11.22	As a ring of gold in a swine’s snout,
PRO.11.22	So is a beautiful woman who is without discretion [her lack of character mocks her beauty].
PRO.11.23	The desire of the righteous brings only good,
PRO.11.23	But the expectation of the wicked brings wrath.
PRO.11.24	There is the one who [generously] scatters [abroad], and yet increases all the more;
PRO.11.24	And there is the one who withholds what is justly due, 
PRO.11.25	The generous man [is a source of blessing and] shall be prosperous 
PRO.11.25	And he who waters will himself be watered [reaping the generosity he has sown].
PRO.11.26	The people curse him who holds back grain [when the public needs it],
PRO.11.26	But a blessing [from God and man] is upon the head of him who sells it.
PRO.11.27	He who diligently seeks good seeks favor 
PRO.11.27	But he who seeks evil, evil will come to him.
PRO.11.28	He who leans on 
PRO.11.28	But the righteous [who trust in God’s provision] will flourish like a

PRO.11.29	And the foolish will be a servant to the wise-hearted.
PRO.11.30	The fruit of the [consistently] righteous is a tree of life,
PRO.11.30	And he who is wise captures 
PRO.11.31	If the righteous will be rewarded on the earth [with godly blessings],
PRO.11.31	How much more [will] the wicked and the sinner [be repaid with punishment]!
PRO.12.1	Whoever loves instruction 
PRO.12.1	But he who hates reproof 
PRO.12.2	A good man will obtain favor from the L
PRO.12.2	But He will condemn a man who devises evil.
PRO.12.3	A man will not be established by wickedness,
PRO.12.3	But the root of the [consistently] righteous will not be moved.
PRO.12.4	A virtuous 
PRO.12.4	But she who shames him [with her foolishness] is like rottenness in his bones.
PRO.12.5	The thoughts 
PRO.12.5	But the counsels 
PRO.12.6	The [malevolent] words of the wicked lie in wait for [innocent] blood [to slander],
PRO.12.6	But the mouth of the upright will rescue 
PRO.12.7	The wicked are overthrown [by their evil] and are no more,
PRO.12.7	But the house of the [consistently] righteous will stand [securely].
PRO.12.8	A man will be commended according to his insight 
PRO.12.8	But the one who is of a perverse mind will be despised.
PRO.12.9	Than he who [boastfully] honors himself [pretending to be what he is not] and lacks bread.
PRO.12.10	A righteous man has kind regard for the life of his animal,
PRO.12.10	But even the compassion of the wicked is cruel.
PRO.12.11	He who tills his land will have plenty of bread,
PRO.12.11	But he who follows worthless 
PRO.12.12	The wicked desire the plunder of evil men,
PRO.12.12	But the root of the righteous yields 
PRO.12.13	An evil man is [dangerously] ensnared by the transgression of his lips,
PRO.12.13	But the righteous will escape from trouble.
PRO.12.14	A man will be satisfied with good from the fruit of his words,
PRO.12.14	And the deeds of a man’s hands will return to him [as a harvest].
PRO.12.15	The way of the [arrogant] fool [who rejects God’s wisdom] is right in his own eyes,
PRO.12.15	But a wise 
PRO.12.16	The [arrogant] fool’s anger is quickly known [because he lacks self-control and common sense],
PRO.12.16	But a prudent man ignores an insult.
PRO.12.17	He who speaks truth [when he testifies] tells what is right,
PRO.12.17	But a false witness utters deceit [in court].
PRO.12.18	There is one who speaks rashly like the thrusts of a sword,
PRO.12.18	But the tongue of the wise brings healing.
PRO.12.19	Truthful lips will be established forever,
PRO.12.19	But a lying tongue is [credited] only for a moment.
PRO.12.20	Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil,
PRO.12.20	But counselors of peace have joy.
PRO.12.21	No harm befalls the righteous,
PRO.12.21	But the wicked are filled with trouble.
PRO.12.22	Lying lips are extremely disgusting to the L
PRO.12.22	But those who deal faithfully are His delight.
PRO.12.23	A shrewd man is reluctant to display his knowledge [until the proper time],
PRO.12.23	But the heart of [over-confident] fools proclaims foolishness.
PRO.12.24	The hand of the diligent will rule,
PRO.12.24	But the negligent 
PRO.12.25	Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down,
PRO.12.25	But a good (encouraging) word makes it glad.
PRO.12.26	The righteous man is a guide to his neighbor,
PRO.12.26	But the way of the wicked leads them astray.
PRO.12.27	The lazy man does not catch 
PRO.12.27	But the precious possession of a [wise] man is diligence [because he recognizes opportunities and seizes them].
PRO.12.28	In the way of righteousness is life,
PRO.12.28	And in its pathway there is no death [but immortality—eternal life].
PRO.13.1	A wise son heeds 
PRO.13.1	But a scoffer does not listen to reprimand 
PRO.13.2	From the fruit of his mouth a [wise] man enjoys good,
PRO.13.2	But the desire of the treacherous is for violence.
PRO.13.3	The one who guards his mouth [thinking before he speaks] protects his life;
PRO.13.3	The one who opens his lips wide [and chatters without thinking] comes to ruin.
PRO.13.4	The soul (appetite) of the lazy person craves and gets nothing [for lethargy overcomes ambition],
PRO.13.4	But the soul (appetite) of the diligent [who works willingly] is rich 
PRO.13.5	A righteous man hates lies,
PRO.13.5	But a wicked man is loathsome, and he acts shamefully.
PRO.13.6	Righteousness (being in right standing with God) guards the one whose way is blameless,
PRO.13.6	But wickedness undermines 
PRO.13.7	There is one who pretends to be rich, yet has nothing at all;
PRO.13.8	The ransom for a man’s life is his wealth,
PRO.13.8	But the poor man does not even have to listen to a rebuke 
PRO.13.9	The light of the righteous [within him—grows brighter and] rejoices,
PRO.13.9	But the lamp of the wicked [is a temporary light and] goes out.

PRO.13.11	Wealth 
PRO.13.11	But he who gathers gradually by [honest] labor will increase [his riches].
PRO.13.12	Hope deferred makes the heart sick,
PRO.13.12	But when desire is fulfilled, it is a tree of life.
PRO.13.13	Whoever despises the word 
PRO.13.13	But he who [reverently] fears 
PRO.13.14	The teaching of the wise is a fountain 
PRO.13.14	So that one may avoid the snares of death.
PRO.13.15	Good understanding wins favor [from others],
PRO.13.15	But the way of the unfaithful is hard [like barren, dry soil].

PRO.13.16	But a [closed-minded] fool [who refuses to learn] displays his foolishness [for all to see].
PRO.13.17	A wicked messenger falls into hardship,
PRO.13.17	But a faithful ambassador brings healing.
PRO.13.18	Poverty and shame will come to him who refuses instruction 
PRO.13.18	But he who accepts 
PRO.13.19	Desire realized is sweet to the soul;
PRO.13.19	But it is detestable to fools to turn away from evil [which they have planned].
PRO.13.20	He who walks [as a companion] with wise men will be wise,
PRO.13.20	But the companions of [conceited, dull-witted] fools [are fools themselves and] will experience harm.
PRO.13.21	Adversity pursues sinners,
PRO.13.21	But the [consistently] upright will be rewarded with prosperity.
PRO.13.22	A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children,
PRO.13.22	And the wealth of the sinner is stored up for [the hands of] the righteous.
PRO.13.23	Abundant food is in the fallow (uncultivated) ground of the poor,
PRO.13.23	But [without protection] it is swept away by injustice.
PRO.13.24	He who withholds the rod [of discipline] hates his son,
PRO.13.24	But he who loves him disciplines 
PRO.13.25	The [consistently] righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite,
PRO.13.25	But the stomach of the wicked is in need [of bread].
PRO.14.1	The wise woman builds her house [on a foundation of godly precepts, and her household thrives],
PRO.14.1	But the foolish one [who lacks spiritual insight] tears it down with her own hands [by ignoring godly principles].

PRO.14.2	But he who is devious in his ways despises Him.
PRO.14.3	In the mouth of the [arrogant] 
PRO.14.3	But the lips of the wise [when they speak with godly wisdom] will protect them.
PRO.14.4	Where there are no oxen, the manger is clean,
PRO.14.4	But much revenue [because of good crops] comes by the strength of the ox.
PRO.14.5	A faithful 
PRO.14.5	But a false witness speaks lies.
PRO.14.6	A scoffer seeks wisdom and finds none [for his ears are closed to wisdom],
PRO.14.6	But knowledge is easy for one who understands [because he is willing to learn].
PRO.14.7	Leave the presence of a [shortsighted] fool,
PRO.14.7	For you will not find knowledge 
PRO.14.8	The wisdom of the sensible is to understand his way,
PRO.14.8	But the foolishness of [shortsighted] fools is deceit.
PRO.14.9	Fools mock sin [but sin mocks the fools],
PRO.14.9	But among the upright there is good will 
PRO.14.10	The heart knows its own bitterness,
PRO.14.10	And no stranger shares its joy.
PRO.14.11	The house of the wicked will be overthrown,
PRO.14.11	But the tent of the upright will thrive.
PRO.14.12	There is a way

PRO.17.18	A man lacking common sense gives a pledge
PRO.17.18	And becomes guarantor [for the debt of another] in the presence of his neighbor.
PRO.17.19	He who loves transgression loves strife 
PRO.17.19	He who [proudly] raises his gate seeks destruction [because of his arrogant pride].
PRO.17.20	He who has a crooked mind finds no good,
PRO.17.20	And he who is perverted in his language falls into evil.
PRO.17.21	He who becomes the parent of a fool [who is spiritually blind] does so to his sorrow,

PRO.17.26	Nor to strike the noble for their uprightness.
PRO.17.27	He who has knowledge restrains

PRO.17.28	Even a [callous, arrogant] fool, when he keeps silent, is considered wise;
PRO.17.28	When he closes his lips he is regarded as sensible (prudent, discreet) 
PRO.18.1	He who [willfully] separates himself [from God and man] seeks his own desire,
PRO.18.1	He quarrels against all sound wisdom.
PRO.18.2	A [closed-minded] fool does not delight in understanding,
PRO.18.2	But only in revealing his personal opinions [unwittingly displaying his self-indulgence and his stupidity].
PRO.18.3	When the wicked man comes [to the depth of evil], contempt [of all that is pure and good] also comes,
PRO.18.3	And with inner baseness (dishonor) comes outer shame (scorn).
PRO.18.4	The words of a man’s mouth are like deep waters [copious and difficult to fathom];
PRO.18.4	The fountain of [mature, godly] wisdom is like a bubbling stream [sparkling, fresh, pure, and life-giving].
PRO.18.5	To show respect to the wicked person is not good,
PRO.18.5	Nor to push aside 
PRO.18.6	A fool’s lips bring contention

PRO.18.13	It is folly and shame to him.

PRO.18.19	A brother offended

PRO.19.2	Also it is not good for a person to be without knowledge,

PRO.19.3	The foolishness of man undermines his way [ruining whatever he undertakes];

PRO.21.1	The king’s heart is like channels of water in the hand of the L
PRO.21.1	He turns it whichever way He wishes.
PRO.21.2	Every man’s way is right in his own eyes,
PRO.21.2	But the L
PRO.21.3	To do righteousness and justice
PRO.21.3	Is more acceptable to the L
PRO.21.4	Haughty 
PRO.21.4	The lamp of the wicked [their self-centered pride], is sin [in the eyes of God].
PRO.21.5	The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance 
PRO.21.5	But everyone who acts in haste comes surely to poverty.
PRO.21.6	Acquiring treasures by a lying tongue
PRO.21.6	Is a fleeting vapor, the seeking 
PRO.21.7	The violence of the wicked will [return to them and] drag them away [like fish caught in a net],
PRO.21.7	Because they refuse to act with justice.
PRO.21.8	The way of the guilty is [exceedingly] crooked,
PRO.21.8	But as for the pure, his conduct is upright.
PRO.21.9	It is better to live in a corner of the housetop [on the flat roof, exposed to the weather]
PRO.21.9	Than in a house shared with a quarrelsome (contentious) woman.
PRO.21.10	The soul of the wicked desires evil [like an addictive substance];
PRO.21.10	His neighbor finds no compassion in his eyes.
PRO.21.11	When the scoffer is punished, the naive [observes the lesson and] becomes wise;
PRO.21.11	But when the wise 
PRO.21.12	The righteous one keeps an eye on the house of the wicked—
PRO.21.12	How the wicked are cast down to ruin.
PRO.21.13	Whoever shuts his ears at the cry of the poor
PRO.21.13	Will cry out himself and not be answered.
PRO.21.14	A gift in secret subdues anger,
PRO.21.14	And a bribe [hidden] in the pocket, strong wrath.
PRO.21.15	When justice is done, it is a joy to the righteous (the upright, the one in right standing with God),
PRO.21.15	But to the evildoers it is disaster.
PRO.21.16	A man who wanders from the way of understanding (godly wisdom)
PRO.21.16	Will remain in the assembly of the dead.
PRO.21.17	He who loves [only selfish] pleasure 
PRO.21.17	He who loves 
PRO.21.18	The wicked become a ransom for the righteous,
PRO.21.18	And the treacherous in the place of the upright [for they fall into their own traps].
PRO.21.19	It is better to dwell in a desert land
PRO.21.19	Than with a contentious and troublesome woman.
PRO.21.20	There is precious treasure and oil in the house of the wise [who prepare for the future],
PRO.21.20	But a short-sighted 
PRO.21.21	He who earnestly seeks righteousness and loyalty
PRO.21.21	Finds life, righteousness, and honor.
PRO.21.22	A wise man scales the city [walls] of the mighty
PRO.21.22	And brings down the stronghold in which they trust.
PRO.21.23	He who guards his mouth and his tongue
PRO.21.23	Guards himself from troubles.
PRO.21.24	“Proud,” “Haughty,” “Scoffer,” are his names
PRO.21.24	Who acts with overbearing 
PRO.21.25	The desire of the lazy kills him,
PRO.21.25	For his hands refuse to labor;
PRO.21.26	He craves all the day long [and does no work],
PRO.21.26	But the righteous [willingly] gives and does not withhold [what he has].
PRO.21.27	The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable 
PRO.21.27	How much more [unacceptable and insulting can it be] when he brings it with evil intention?
PRO.21.28	A false witness will perish,
PRO.21.28	But a man who listens 
PRO.21.29	A wicked man puts on a bold face,
PRO.21.29	But as for the upright, he considers, directs, 
PRO.21.30	There is no [human] wisdom or understanding

PRO.22.4	The reward of humility [that is, having a realistic view of one’s importance] and the [reverent, worshipful] fear of the L
PRO.22.4	Is riches, honor, and life.
PRO.22.5	Thorns and snares are in the way of the obstinate [for their lack of honor and their wrong-doing traps them];

PRO.22.6	Train up a child in the way he should go [teaching him to seek God’s wisdom and will for his abilities and talents],
PRO.22.6	Even when he is old he will not depart from it.
PRO.22.7	The rich rules over the poor,
PRO.22.7	And the borrower is servant to the lender.
PRO.22.8	He who sows injustice will reap [a harvest of] trouble,
PRO.22.8	And the rod of his wrath [with which he oppresses others] will fail.
PRO.22.9	He who is generous will be blessed,
PRO.22.9	For he gives some of his food to the poor.
PRO.22.10	Drive out the scoffer, and contention will go away;
PRO.22.10	Even strife and dishonor will cease.
PRO.22.11	He who loves purity of heart

PRO.22.13	The lazy one [manufactures excuses and] says, “There is a lion outside!
PRO.22.13	I will be killed in the streets [if I go out to work]!”
PRO.22.14	The mouth of an immoral woman is a deep pit [deep and inescapable];
PRO.22.14	He who is cursed by the L
PRO.22.15	Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child;

PRO.22.20	In counsels and knowledge,
PRO.22.21	To let you know the certainty of the words of truth,
PRO.22.21	That you may give a correct answer to him who sent you?
PRO.22.22	Do not rob the poor because he is poor [and defenseless],
PRO.22.22	Nor crush the afflicted [by legal proceedings] at the gate [where the city court is held],
PRO.22.23	For the L

PRO.22.24	Do not even associate with a man given to angry outbursts;
PRO.22.24	Or go [along] with a hot-tempered man,
PRO.22.25	Or you will learn his [undisciplined] ways
PRO.22.25	And get yourself trapped [in a situation from which it is hard to escape].
PRO.22.26	Do not be among those who give pledges [involving themselves in others’ finances],

PRO.22.28	Do not move the ancient landmark [at the boundary of the property]
PRO.22.28	Which your fathers have set.
PRO.22.29	Do you see a man skillful 
PRO.22.29	He will stand [in honor] before kings;
PRO.22.29	He will not stand before obscure men.
PRO.23.1	When you sit down to dine with a ruler,

PRO.23.6	Or desire his delicacies;

PRO.23.7	He says to you, “Eat and drink,”
PRO.23.7	Yet his heart is not with you [but it is begrudging the cost].
PRO.23.8	The morsel which you have eaten you will vomit up,
PRO.23.8	And you will waste your compliments.
PRO.23.9	Do not speak in the ears of a fool,

PRO.23.10	Do not move the ancient landmark [at the boundary of the property]

PRO.23.11	He will plead their case against you.

PRO.23.15	My son, if your heart is wise,
PRO.23.15	My heart will also be glad;
PRO.23.16	Yes, my heart will rejoice
PRO.23.16	When your lips speak right things.

PRO.23.17	But [continue to] live in the [reverent, worshipful] fear of the L
PRO.23.18	Surely there is a future [and a reward],

PRO.23.19	And direct your heart in the way [of the L
PRO.23.20	Do not associate with heavy drinkers of wine,
PRO.23.21	For the heavy drinker and the glutton will come to poverty,
PRO.23.21	And the drowsiness [of overindulgence] will clothe one with rags.
PRO.23.22	Listen to your father, who sired you,
PRO.23.22	And do not despise your mother when she is old.
PRO.23.23	Get wisdom and instruction and understanding.
PRO.23.24	The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice,
PRO.23.24	And he who sires a wise child will have joy in him.
PRO.23.25	Let your father and your mother be glad,
PRO.23.25	And let her who gave birth to you rejoice [in your wise and godly choices].
PRO.23.26	My son, give me your heart
PRO.23.26	And let your eyes delight in my ways,
PRO.23.27	For a prostitute is a deep pit,
PRO.23.27	And an immoral woman is a narrow well.
PRO.23.28	She lurks 
PRO.23.28	And she increases the faithless among men.
PRO.23.29	Who has woe? Who has sorrow?
PRO.23.29	Who has strife? Who has complaining?
PRO.23.29	Who has wounds without cause?
PRO.23.29	Whose eyes are red 
PRO.23.30	Those who linger long over wine,
PRO.23.30	Those who go to taste mixed wine.
PRO.23.31	Do not look at wine when it is red,
PRO.23.31	When it sparkles in the glass,
PRO.23.31	When it goes down smoothly.
PRO.23.32	At the last it bites like a serpent
PRO.23.32	And stings like a viper.
PRO.23.33	Your [drunken] eyes will see strange things
PRO.23.33	And your mind will utter perverse things [untrue things, twisted things].
PRO.23.34	And you will be [as unsteady] as one who lies down in the middle of the sea,
PRO.23.34	And [as vulnerable to disaster] as one who lies down on the top of a ship’s mast, 
PRO.23.35	“They struck me, but I was not hurt!
PRO.23.35	They beat me, but I did not feel it!
PRO.23.35	When will I wake up?
PRO.23.35	I will seek more wine.”
PRO.24.1	Do not be envious of evil men,
PRO.24.1	Nor desire to be with them;
PRO.24.2	For their minds plot violence,
PRO.24.2	And their lips talk of trouble [for the innocent].
PRO.24.3	Through [skillful and godly] wisdom a house [a life, a home, a family] is built,
PRO.24.3	And by understanding it is established [on a sound and good foundation],
PRO.24.4	And by knowledge its rooms are filled
PRO.24.4	With all precious and pleasant riches.
PRO.24.5	A wise man is strong,
PRO.24.5	And a man of knowledge strengthens his power;
PRO.24.6	For by wise guidance you can wage your war,
PRO.24.6	And in an abundance of [wise] counselors there is victory 
PRO.24.7	Wisdom is too exalted for a [hardened, arrogant] 
PRO.24.7	He does not open his mouth in the gate [where the city’s rulers sit in judgment].
PRO.24.8	He who plans to do evil
PRO.24.8	Will be called a schemer 
PRO.24.9	The devising of folly is sin,
PRO.24.9	And the scoffer is repulsive to men.
PRO.24.10	If you are slack (careless) in the day of distress,
PRO.24.10	Your strength is limited.
PRO.24.11	Rescue those who are being taken away to death,
PRO.24.11	And those who stagger to the slaughter, Oh hold them back [from their doom]!
PRO.24.12	If you [claim ignorance and] say, “See, we did not know this,”
PRO.24.12	Does He not consider it who weighs 
PRO.24.12	And does He not know it who guards your life 
PRO.24.12	And will He not repay [you and] every man according to his works?
PRO.24.13	My son, eat honey, because it is good,
PRO.24.13	And the drippings of the honeycomb are sweet to your taste.
PRO.24.14	Know that [skillful and godly] wisdom is [so very good] for your life 
PRO.24.14	If you find wisdom, then there will be a future 
PRO.24.14	And your hope 
PRO.24.15	Do not lie in wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous;
PRO.24.15	Do not destroy his resting place;
PRO.24.16	For a righteous man falls seven times, and rises again,
PRO.24.16	But the wicked stumble in 
PRO.24.17	Do not rejoice 
PRO.24.17	And do not let your heart be glad [in self-righteousness] when he stumbles,
PRO.24.18	Or the L
PRO.24.18	And turn His anger away from your enemy.
PRO.24.19	Do not get upset because of evildoers,
PRO.24.19	Or be envious of the wicked,
PRO.24.20	For there will be no future for the evil man;
PRO.24.20	The lamp of the wicked will be put out.
PRO.24.21	My son, fear the L
PRO.24.21	And do not associate with those who are given to change [of allegiance, and are revolutionary],
PRO.24.22	For their tragedy will rise suddenly,
PRO.24.22	And who knows the punishment that both [the L
PRO.24.23	These also are sayings of the wise:
PRO.24.23	To show partiality in judgment is not good.
PRO.24.24	He who says to the wicked, “You are righteous,”
PRO.24.24	Peoples will curse him, nations will denounce him;
PRO.24.25	But to those [honorable judges] who rebuke the 
PRO.24.25	And a good blessing will come upon them.
PRO.24.26	He kisses the lips [and wins the hearts of people]
PRO.24.26	Who gives a right 
PRO.24.27	Prepare your work outside
PRO.24.27	And get it ready for yourself in the field;
PRO.24.28	Do not be a witness against your 
PRO.24.28	And do not deceive with your lips [speak neither lies nor half-truths].
PRO.24.29	Do not say, “I will do to him as he has done to me;
PRO.24.29	I will pay the man back for his deed.”
PRO.24.30	I went by the field of the lazy man,
PRO.24.30	And by the vineyard of the man lacking understanding 
PRO.24.31	And, behold, it was all overgrown with thorns,
PRO.24.31	And nettles were covering its surface,
PRO.24.31	And its stone wall was broken down.
PRO.24.32	When I saw, I considered it well;
PRO.24.32	I looked and received instruction.
PRO.24.33	“Yet a little sleep, a little slumber,
PRO.24.33	A little folding of the hands to rest [and daydream],”
PRO.24.34	Then your poverty will come as a robber,
PRO.24.34	And your want like an armed man.
PRO.25.1	These are also the proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied:
PRO.25.2	It is the glory of God to conceal a matter,
PRO.25.2	But the glory of kings is to search out a matter.
PRO.25.3	As the heavens for height and the earth for depth,
PRO.25.3	So the hearts 
PRO.25.4	Take away the dross from the silver,
PRO.25.4	And there comes out [the pure metal for] a vessel for the silversmith [to shape].
PRO.25.5	Take away the wicked from before the king,
PRO.25.5	And his throne will be established in righteousness.
PRO.25.6	Do not be boastfully ambitious 
PRO.25.6	And do not stand in the place of great men;
PRO.25.7	For it is better that it be said to you, “Come up here,”
PRO.25.7	Than for you to be placed lower in the presence of the prince,
PRO.25.7	Whom your eyes have seen.
PRO.25.8	Do not rush out to argue 
PRO.25.8	Otherwise what will you do in the end [when your case is lost and]
PRO.25.8	When your neighbor (opponent) humiliates you?
PRO.25.9	Argue your case with your neighbor himself [before you go to court];
PRO.25.9	And do not reveal another’s secret,
PRO.25.10	Or he who hears it will shame you
PRO.25.10	And the rumor about you [and your action in court] will have no end.
PRO.25.11	Like apples of gold in settings of silver
PRO.25.11	Is a word spoken at the right time.
PRO.25.12	Like an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold
PRO.25.12	Is a wise reprover to an ear that listens 
PRO.25.13	Like the cold of snow [brought from the mountains] in the time of harvest,
PRO.25.13	So is a faithful messenger to those who send him;
PRO.25.13	For he refreshes the life of his masters.
PRO.25.14	Like clouds and wind without rain
PRO.25.14	Is a man who boasts falsely of gifts [he does not give].
PRO.25.15	By patience 
PRO.25.15	And a soft 
PRO.25.16	Have you found [pleasure sweet like] honey? Eat only as much as you need,
PRO.25.16	Otherwise, being filled excessively, you vomit it.
PRO.25.17	Let your foot seldom be in your neighbor’s house,
PRO.25.17	Or he will become tired of you and hate you.
PRO.25.18	Like a club and a sword and a piercing arrow
PRO.25.18	Is a man who testifies falsely against his neighbor (acquaintance).
PRO.25.19	Like a broken tooth or an unsteady foot
PRO.25.19	Is confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble.
PRO.25.20	Like one who takes off a garment in cold weather, or like [a reactive, useless mixture of] vinegar on soda,
PRO.25.20	Is he who [thoughtlessly] sings [joyful] songs to a heavy heart.
PRO.25.21	If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat;
PRO.25.21	And if he is thirsty, give him water to drink;
PRO.25.22	For in doing so, you will 
PRO.25.22	And the L
PRO.25.23	The north wind brings forth rain;
PRO.25.23	And a backbiting tongue, an angry countenance.
PRO.25.24	It is better to live in a corner of the housetop [on the flat roof, exposed to the weather]
PRO.25.24	Than in a house shared with a quarrelsome (contentious) woman.
PRO.25.25	Like cold water to a thirsty soul,
PRO.25.25	So is good news from a distant land.
PRO.25.26	Like a muddied fountain and a polluted spring
PRO.25.26	Is a righteous man who yields 
PRO.25.27	It is not good to eat much honey,
PRO.25.27	Nor is it glorious to seek one’s own glory.
PRO.25.28	Like a city that is broken down and without walls [leaving it unprotected]
PRO.25.28	Is a man who has no self-control over his spirit [and sets himself up for trouble].
PRO.26.1	Like snow in summer and like rain in harvest,
PRO.26.1	So honor is not fitting for a [shortsighted] 
PRO.26.2	Like the sparrow in her wandering, like the swallow in her flying,
PRO.26.2	So the curse without cause does not come 
PRO.26.3	A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey,
PRO.26.3	And a rod for the backs of fools [who refuse to learn].
PRO.26.4	Do not answer [nor pretend to agree with the frivolous comments of] a [closed-minded] fool according to his folly,
PRO.26.4	Otherwise you, even you, will be like him.
PRO.26.5	Answer [and correct the erroneous concepts of] a fool according to his folly,
PRO.26.5	Otherwise he will be wise in his own eyes [if he thinks you agree with him].
PRO.26.6	He who sends a message by the hand of a fool
PRO.26.6	Cuts off 
PRO.26.7	Like the legs which are useless to the lame,
PRO.26.7	So is a proverb in the mouth of a fool [who cannot learn from its wisdom].
PRO.26.8	Like one who [absurdly] binds a stone in a sling [making it impossible to throw],
PRO.26.8	So is he who [absurdly] gives honor to a fool.
PRO.26.9	Like a thorn that goes [without being felt] into the hand of a drunken man,
PRO.26.9	So is a proverb in the mouth of a fool [who remains unaffected by its wisdom].
PRO.26.10	Like a [careless] archer who [shoots arrows wildly and] wounds everyone,
PRO.26.10	So is he who hires a fool or those who [by chance just] pass by.
PRO.26.11	Like a dog that returns to his vomit
PRO.26.11	Is a fool who repeats his foolishness.
PRO.26.12	Do you see a man [who is unteachable and] wise in his own eyes 
PRO.26.12	There is more hope for a fool than for him.
PRO.26.13	The lazy person [who is self-indulgent and relies on lame excuses] says, “There is a lion in the road!
PRO.26.13	A lion is in the open square [and if I go outside to work I will be killed]!”
PRO.26.14	As the door turns on its hinges,
PRO.26.14	So does the lazy person on his bed [never getting out of it].
PRO.26.15	The lazy person buries his hand in the dish [losing opportunity after opportunity];
PRO.26.15	It wearies him to bring it back to his mouth.
PRO.26.16	The lazy person is wiser in his own eyes
PRO.26.16	Than seven [sensible] men who can give a discreet answer.
PRO.26.17	Like one who grabs a dog by the ears [and is likely to be bitten]
PRO.26.17	Is he who, passing by, stops to meddle with a dispute that is none of his business.
PRO.26.18	Like a madman who throws
PRO.26.18	Firebrands, arrows, and death,
PRO.26.19	So is the man who deceives his neighbor (acquaintance, friend)
PRO.26.19	And then says, “Was I not joking?”
PRO.26.20	For lack of wood the fire goes out,
PRO.26.20	And where there is no whisperer [who gossips], contention quiets down.
PRO.26.21	Like charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire,
PRO.26.21	So is a contentious man to kindle strife.
PRO.26.22	The words of a whisperer (gossip) are like dainty morsels [to be greedily eaten];
PRO.26.22	They go down into the innermost chambers of the body [to be remembered and mused upon].
PRO.26.23	Like a [common] clay vessel covered with the silver dross [making it appear silver when it has no real value]
PRO.26.23	Are burning lips [murmuring manipulative words] and a wicked heart.
PRO.26.24	He who hates, disguises it with his lips,
PRO.26.24	But he stores up deceit in his heart.
PRO.26.25	When he speaks graciously 
PRO.26.25	For seven abominations are in his heart.
PRO.26.26	His malevolence will be revealed openly before the assembly.
PRO.26.27	Whoever digs a pit [for another man’s feet] will fall into it,
PRO.26.27	And he who rolls a stone [up a hill to do mischief], it will come back on him.
PRO.26.28	A lying tongue hates those it wounds 
PRO.26.28	And a flattering mouth works ruin.
PRO.27.1	Do not boast about tomorrow,
PRO.27.1	For you do not know what a day may bring.
PRO.27.2	Let another praise you, and not your own mouth;
PRO.27.2	A stranger, and not your own lips.
PRO.27.3	Stone is heavy and the sand weighty,
PRO.27.3	But a fool’s [unreasonable] wrath is heavier 
PRO.27.4	Wrath is cruel and anger is an overwhelming flood,
PRO.27.4	But who is able to endure 
PRO.27.5	Better is an open reprimand [of loving correction]
PRO.27.5	Than love that is hidden.
PRO.27.6	Faithful are the wounds of a friend [who corrects out of love and concern],
PRO.27.6	But the kisses of an enemy are deceitful [because they serve his hidden agenda].
PRO.27.7	He who is satisfied loathes honey,
PRO.27.7	But to the hungry soul any bitter thing is sweet.
PRO.27.8	Like a bird that wanders from her nest [with its comfort and safety],
PRO.27.8	So is a man who wanders from his home.
PRO.27.9	Oil and perfume make the heart glad;
PRO.27.9	So does the sweetness of a friend’s counsel that comes from the heart.
PRO.27.10	Do not abandon your own friend and your father’s friend,
PRO.27.10	And do not go to your brother’s house in the day of your disaster.
PRO.27.10	Better is a neighbor who is near than a brother who is far away.
PRO.27.11	My son, be wise, and make my heart glad,
PRO.27.11	That I may reply to him who reproaches (reprimands, criticizes) me.
PRO.27.12	A prudent man sees evil and hides himself 
PRO.27.12	But the naive [who are easily misled] continue on and are punished [by suffering the consequences of sin].
PRO.27.13	[The judge tells the creditor,] “Take the garment of one who is surety (guarantees a loan) for a stranger;
PRO.27.13	And hold him in pledge when he is surety for an immoral woman [for it is unlikely the debt will be repaid].”
PRO.27.14	He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning,
PRO.27.14	It will be counted as a curse to him [for it will either be annoying or his purpose will be suspect].
PRO.27.15	A constant dripping on a day of steady rain
PRO.27.15	And a contentious (quarrelsome) woman are alike;
PRO.27.16	Whoever attempts to restrain her [criticism] might as well try to stop the wind,
PRO.27.16	And grasps oil with his right hand.
PRO.27.17	As iron sharpens iron,
PRO.27.17	So one man sharpens [and influences] another [through discussion].
PRO.27.18	He who tends the fig tree will eat its fruit,
PRO.27.18	And he who faithfully protects 
PRO.27.19	As in water face 
PRO.27.19	So the heart of man reflects man.
PRO.27.20	Sheol (the place of the dead) and Abaddon (the underworld) are never satisfied;
PRO.27.20	Nor are the eyes of man ever satisfied.
PRO.27.21	The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold [to separate the impurities of the metal],
PRO.27.21	And each is tested by the praise given to him [and his response to it, whether humble or proud].
PRO.27.22	Even though you pound a [hardened, arrogant] fool [who rejects wisdom] in a mortar with a pestle like grain,
PRO.27.22	Yet his foolishness will not leave him.
PRO.27.23	Be diligent to know the condition of your flocks,
PRO.27.23	And pay attention to your herds;
PRO.27.24	For riches are not forever,
PRO.27.24	Nor does a crown 
PRO.27.25	When the grass is gone, the new growth is seen,
PRO.27.25	And herbs of the mountain are gathered in,
PRO.27.26	The lambs will 
PRO.27.26	And the goats will bring the price of a field.
PRO.27.27	And 
PRO.27.27	For the food of your household,
PRO.27.27	And for the maintenance of your maids.
PRO.28.1	The wicked flee when no one pursues them,
PRO.28.1	But the righteous are as bold as a lion.
PRO.28.2	When a land does wrong, it has many princes,
PRO.28.2	But when the ruler is a man of understanding and knowledge, its stability endures.
PRO.28.3	A poor man who oppresses 
PRO.28.3	Is like a sweeping rain which leaves no food.
PRO.28.4	Those who 
PRO.28.4	But those who keep the law [of God and man] struggle with them.
PRO.28.5	Evil men do not understand justice,
PRO.28.5	But they who long for 
PRO.28.6	Better is the poor who walks in his integrity
PRO.28.6	Than he who is crooked 
PRO.28.7	He who keeps the law [of God and man] is a wise 
PRO.28.7	But he who is a companion of gluttons humiliates his father [and himself].
PRO.28.8	He who increases his wealth by interest and usury (excessive interest)
PRO.28.8	Gathers it for him who is gracious to the poor.
PRO.28.9	He who turns his ear away from listening to the law [of God and man],
PRO.28.9	Even his prayer is repulsive [to God].
PRO.28.10	He who leads the upright astray on an evil path
PRO.28.10	Will himself fall into his own pit,
PRO.28.10	But the blameless will inherit good.
PRO.28.11	The rich man [who is conceited and relies on his wealth instead of God] is wise in his own eyes,
PRO.28.11	But the poor man who has understanding [because he relies on God] is able to see through him.
PRO.28.12	When the righteous triumph, there is great glory 
PRO.28.12	But when the wicked rise [to prominence], men hide themselves.
PRO.28.13	He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper,
PRO.28.13	But whoever confesses and 
PRO.28.14	Blessed 
PRO.28.14	But he who hardens his heart [and is determined to sin] will fall into disaster.
PRO.28.15	Like a roaring lion and a charging bear
PRO.28.15	Is a wicked ruler over a poor people.
PRO.28.16	A leader who is a great oppressor lacks understanding 
PRO.28.16	But he who hates unjust gain will [be blessed and] prolong his days.
PRO.28.17	A man who is burdened with the guilt of human blood (murder)
PRO.28.17	Will be a fugitive until death; let no one support him 
PRO.28.18	He who walks blamelessly 
PRO.28.18	But he who is crooked (perverse) will suddenly fall.
PRO.28.19	He who cultivates his land will have plenty of bread,
PRO.28.19	But he who follows worthless people 
PRO.28.20	A faithful (right-minded) man will abound with blessings,
PRO.28.20	But he who hurries to be rich will not go unpunished.
PRO.28.21	To have regard for one person over another 
PRO.28.21	Because for a piece of bread a man will transgress.
PRO.28.22	He who has an evil 
PRO.28.22	And does not know that poverty will come upon him.
PRO.28.23	He who [appropriately] reprimands a [wise] man will afterward find more favor
PRO.28.23	Than he who flatters with the tongue.
PRO.28.24	He who robs his father or his mother
PRO.28.24	And says, “This is no sin,”
PRO.28.24	Is [not only a thief but also] the companion of a man who destroys.
PRO.28.25	An arrogant 
PRO.28.25	But he who trusts in the L
PRO.28.26	He who trusts confidently in his own heart is a [dull, thickheaded] fool,
PRO.28.26	But he who walks in [skillful and godly] wisdom will be rescued.
PRO.28.27	He who gives to the poor will never want,
PRO.28.27	But he who shuts his eyes [from their need] will have many curses.
PRO.28.28	When the wicked rise [to power], men hide themselves;
PRO.28.28	But when the wicked perish, the [consistently] righteous increase 
PRO.29.1	He who hardens his neck 
PRO.29.1	Will suddenly be broken beyond repair.
PRO.29.2	When the righteous are in authority 
PRO.29.2	But when the wicked man rules, the people groan 
PRO.29.3	A man who loves [skillful and godly] wisdom makes his father joyful,
PRO.29.3	But he who associates with prostitutes wastes his wealth.
PRO.29.4	The king establishes (stabilizes) the land by justice,
PRO.29.4	But a man who takes bribes overthrows it.
PRO.29.5	A man who flatters his neighbor [with smooth words intending to do harm]
PRO.29.5	Is spreading a net for his own feet.
PRO.29.6	By his wicked plan an evil man is trapped,
PRO.29.6	But the righteous man sings and rejoices [for his plan brings good things to him].
PRO.29.7	The righteous man cares for the rights of the poor,
PRO.29.7	But the wicked man has no interest in such knowledge.
PRO.29.8	Scoffers set a city afire [by stirring up trouble],
PRO.29.8	But wise men turn away anger [and restore order with their good judgment].
PRO.29.9	If a wise man has a controversy with a foolish 
PRO.29.9	The foolish man [ignores logic and fairness and] only rages or laughs, and there is no peace (rest, agreement).
PRO.29.10	The bloodthirsty hate the blameless [because of his integrity],
PRO.29.10	But the upright are concerned for his life.
PRO.29.11	A [shortsighted] fool always loses his temper 
PRO.29.11	But a wise man [uses self-control and] holds it back.
PRO.29.12	If a ruler pays attention to lies [and encourages corruption],
PRO.29.12	All his officials 
PRO.29.13	The poor man and the oppressor have this in common:
PRO.29.13	The L
PRO.29.14	If a king faithfully 
PRO.29.14	His throne shall be established forever.
PRO.29.15	The rod and reproof (godly instruction) give wisdom,
PRO.29.15	But a child who gets his own way brings shame to his mother.
PRO.29.16	When the wicked are in authority, transgression increases,
PRO.29.16	But the righteous will see the downfall of the wicked.
PRO.29.17	Correct your son, and he will give you comfort;
PRO.29.17	Yes, he will delight your soul.
PRO.29.18	Where there is no vision [no revelation of God and His word], the people are unrestrained;
PRO.29.18	But happy 
PRO.29.19	A servant will not be corrected by words 
PRO.29.19	For though he understands, he will not respond [nor pay attention].
PRO.29.20	Do you see a [conceited] man who speaks quickly [offering his opinions or answering without thinking]?
PRO.29.20	There is more hope for a [thickheaded] 
PRO.29.21	He who pampers his slave from childhood
PRO.29.21	Will find him to be a son in the end.
PRO.29.22	An angry man stirs up strife,
PRO.29.22	And a hot-tempered 
PRO.29.23	A man’s pride 
PRO.29.23	But he who has a humble spirit will obtain honor.
PRO.29.24	Whoever is partner with a thief hates his own life;
PRO.29.24	He hears the curse [when swearing an oath to testify], but discloses nothing [and commits perjury by omission].
PRO.29.25	The fear of man brings a snare,
PRO.29.25	But whoever trusts in 
PRO.29.26	Many seek the ruler’s favor,
PRO.29.26	But justice for man comes from the L
PRO.29.27	An unjust man is repulsive to the righteous,
PRO.29.27	And he who is upright in the way [of the L
PRO.30.1	The words of 
PRO.30.2	Surely 
PRO.30.2	And I do not have the understanding of a man [for I do not know what I do not know].
PRO.30.3	I have not learned [skillful and godly] wisdom,
PRO.30.3	Nor do I have knowledge of the Holy One [who is the source of wisdom].
PRO.30.4	Who has ascended into heaven and descended?
PRO.30.4	Who has gathered the wind in His fists?
PRO.30.4	Who has bound the waters in His garment?
PRO.30.4	Who has established all the ends of the earth?
PRO.30.4	What is His name, and what is His Son’s name?
PRO.30.4	Certainly you know!
PRO.30.5	Every word of God is tested 
PRO.30.5	He is a shield to those who trust 
PRO.30.6	Do not add to His words,
PRO.30.6	Or He will reprove you, and you will be found a liar.
PRO.30.7	Two things I have asked of You;
PRO.30.7	Do not deny them to me before I die:
PRO.30.8	Keep deception and lies far from me;
PRO.30.8	Give me neither poverty nor riches;
PRO.30.8	Feed me with the food that is my portion,
PRO.30.9	So that I will not be full and deny You and say, “Who is the L
PRO.30.9	Or that I will not be poor and steal,
PRO.30.9	And so profane the name of my God.
PRO.30.10	Do not slander 
PRO.30.10	Or he will curse you [for your interference], and you will be found guilty.
PRO.30.11	There is a generation (class of people) that curses its father
PRO.30.11	And does not bless its mother.
PRO.30.12	There is a generation (class of people) that is pure in its own eyes,
PRO.30.12	Yet is not washed from its filthiness.
PRO.30.13	There is a generation (class of people)—oh, how lofty are their eyes!
PRO.30.13	And their eyelids are raised 
PRO.30.14	There is a generation (class of people) whose teeth are like swords
PRO.30.14	And whose jaw teeth are like knives,
PRO.30.14	To devour the afflicted from the earth
PRO.30.14	And the needy from among men.
PRO.30.15	The leech has two daughters,
PRO.30.15	“Give, give!”
PRO.30.15	There are three things that are never satisfied,
PRO.30.15	Four that do not say, “It is enough”:
PRO.30.16	Earth that is never satisfied with water,
PRO.30.16	And fire that never says, “It is enough.”
PRO.30.17	The eye that mocks a father
PRO.30.17	And scorns a mother,
PRO.30.17	The ravens of the valley will pick it out,
PRO.30.17	And the young vultures will devour it.
PRO.30.18	There are three things which are too astounding 
PRO.30.18	Four which I do not understand:
PRO.30.19	The way of an eagle in the air,
PRO.30.19	The way of a serpent on a rock,
PRO.30.19	The way of a ship in the middle of the sea,
PRO.30.19	And the way of a man with a maid.
PRO.30.20	This is the way of an adulterous woman:
PRO.30.20	She eats and wipes her mouth
PRO.30.20	And says, “I have done no wrong.”
PRO.30.21	Under three things the earth is disquieted 
PRO.30.21	And under four it cannot bear up:
PRO.30.22	Under a servant when he reigns,
PRO.30.23	Under an unloved woman when she gets married,
PRO.30.23	And 
PRO.30.24	There are four things that are small on the earth,
PRO.30.24	But they are exceedingly wise:
PRO.30.25	The ants are not a strong people,
PRO.30.25	Yet they prepare their food in the summer;
PRO.30.26	The 
PRO.30.26	Yet they make their houses in the rocks;
PRO.30.27	The locusts have no king,
PRO.30.27	Yet all of them go out in groups;
PRO.30.28	You may grasp the lizard with your hands,
PRO.30.28	Yet it is in kings’ palaces.
PRO.30.29	There are three things which are stately in step,
PRO.30.29	Even four which are stately in their stride:
PRO.30.30	The lion, which is mighty among beasts
PRO.30.30	And does not turn back before any;
PRO.30.31	The 
PRO.30.31	And the king 
PRO.30.32	If you have foolishly exalted yourself,
PRO.30.32	Or if you have plotted 
PRO.30.33	Surely the churning of milk produces butter,
PRO.30.33	And wringing the nose produces blood;
PRO.30.33	So the churning of anger produces strife.
PRO.31.1	The words of 
PRO.31.2	What, O my 
PRO.31.2	And what, O son of my womb?
PRO.31.2	And what [shall I advise you], O son of my vows?
PRO.31.3	Do not give your [generative] strength to women [neither foreign wives in marriages of alliances, nor 
PRO.31.3	Nor your ways to that which destroys kings.
PRO.31.4	It is not for kings, O Lemuel,
PRO.31.4	It is not for kings to drink wine,
PRO.31.4	Or for rulers to desire strong drink,
PRO.31.5	Otherwise they drink and forget the law 
PRO.31.5	And pervert the rights 
PRO.31.6	Give strong drink [as medicine] to him who is ready to pass away,
PRO.31.6	And wine to him whose life is bitter.
PRO.31.7	Let him drink and forget his poverty
PRO.31.7	And no longer remember his trouble.
PRO.31.8	Open your mouth for the mute,
PRO.31.8	For the rights of all who are unfortunate 
PRO.31.9	Open your mouth, judge righteously,
PRO.31.9	And administer justice for the afflicted and needy.
PRO.31.10	Her value is more precious than jewels 
PRO.31.11	The heart of her husband trusts in her [with secure confidence],
PRO.31.11	And he will have no lack of gain.
PRO.31.12	She comforts, encourages, 
PRO.31.12	All the days of her life.
PRO.31.13	She looks for wool and flax
PRO.31.13	And works with willing hands in delight.
PRO.31.14	She is like the merchant ships [abounding with treasure];
PRO.31.14	She brings her [household’s] food from far away.
PRO.31.15	She rises also while it is still night
PRO.31.15	And gives food to her household
PRO.31.15	And assigns tasks to her maids.
PRO.31.16	She considers a field before she buys 
PRO.31.16	With her profits she plants fruitful vines in her vineyard.
PRO.31.17	She equips herself with strength [spiritual, mental, and physical fitness for her God-given task]
PRO.31.17	And makes her arms strong.
PRO.31.18	She sees that her gain is good;
PRO.31.18	Her lamp does not go out, but it burns continually through the night [she is prepared for whatever lies ahead].
PRO.31.19	She stretches out her hands to the 
PRO.31.19	And her hands hold the spindle [as she spins wool into thread for clothing].
PRO.31.20	She opens 
PRO.31.20	And she reaches out her filled hands to the needy.
PRO.31.21	She does not fear the snow for her household,
PRO.31.21	For all in her household are clothed in [expensive] scarlet [wool].
PRO.31.22	She makes for herself coverlets, cushions, 
PRO.31.22	Her clothing is linen, pure 
PRO.31.23	Her husband is known in the [city’s] gates,
PRO.31.23	When he sits among the elders of the land.
PRO.31.24	She makes [fine] linen garments and sells them;
PRO.31.24	And supplies sashes to the merchants.
PRO.31.25	Strength and dignity are her clothing 
PRO.31.25	And she smiles at the future [knowing that she and her family are prepared].
PRO.31.26	She opens her mouth in [skillful and godly] wisdom,
PRO.31.26	And the teaching of kindness is on her tongue [giving counsel and instruction].
PRO.31.27	She looks well to how things go in her household,
PRO.31.27	And does not eat the bread of idleness.
PRO.31.28	Her children rise up and call her blessed (happy, prosperous, to be admired);
PRO.31.28	Her husband also, and he praises her, 
PRO.31.29	“Many daughters have done nobly,

PRO.31.30	But a woman who fears the L

ECC.1.1	The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
ECC.1.2	“Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher.
ECC.1.2	“Vanity of vanities! All [that is done without God’s guidance] is vanity [futile, meaningless—a wisp of smoke, a vapor that vanishes, merely chasing the wind].”
ECC.1.3	What advantage does man have from all his work
ECC.1.3	Which he does 
ECC.1.4	One generation goes and another generation comes,
ECC.1.4	But the earth remains forever.
ECC.1.5	Also, the sun rises and the sun sets;
ECC.1.5	And hurries to the place where it rises again.
ECC.1.6	The wind blows toward the south,
ECC.1.6	Then circles toward the north;
ECC.1.6	The wind circles 
ECC.1.6	And on its circular course the wind returns.
ECC.1.7	All the rivers flow into the sea,
ECC.1.7	Yet the sea is not full.
ECC.1.7	To the place where the rivers flow,
ECC.1.7	There they flow again.
ECC.1.8	All things are wearisome 
ECC.1.8	Man cannot express it.
ECC.1.8	The eye is not satisfied with seeing,
ECC.1.8	Nor is the ear filled with hearing.
ECC.1.9	That which has been is that which will be [again],
ECC.1.9	And that which has been done is that which will be done again.
ECC.1.9	So there is nothing new under the sun.
ECC.1.10	Is there anything of which it can be said,
ECC.1.10	“See this, it is new”?
ECC.1.10	It has already existed for [the vast] ages [of time recorded or unrecorded]
ECC.1.10	Which were before us.
ECC.1.11	There is no remembrance of earlier things,
ECC.1.11	Nor also of the later things that are to come;
ECC.1.11	There will be for them no remembrance
ECC.1.11	By generations who will come after them.
ECC.1.12	I, the Preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. 
ECC.1.13	And I set my mind to seek and explore by [man’s] 
ECC.1.14	I have seen all the works which have been done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity, a futile grasping 
ECC.1.15	What is crooked cannot be straightened and what is defective 
ECC.1.16	I spoke with my heart, saying, “Behold, I have acquired great [human] wisdom 
ECC.1.17	And I set my mind to know [practical] wisdom and to discern [the character of] madness and folly [in which men seem to find satisfaction]; I realized that this too is a futile grasping 
ECC.1.18	For in much [human] wisdom there is much displeasure 
ECC.2.1	I said to myself, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure 
ECC.2.2	I said of laughter, “It is madness,” and of pleasure, “What does it accomplish?” 
ECC.2.3	I explored with my mind how to gratify myself with wine while [at the same time] having my mind remain steady 
ECC.2.4	I made great works: I built houses for myself; I planted vineyards for myself; 
ECC.2.5	I made gardens and orchards for myself and I planted in them all kinds of fruit trees; 
ECC.2.6	I made pools of water for myself from which to water the forest 
ECC.2.7	I bought male and female slaves and had slaves born in my house. I also possessed herds and flocks larger than any who preceded me in Jerusalem. 
ECC.2.8	Also, I collected for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces. I provided for myself male singers and female singers, and the delights 
ECC.2.9	So I became great and excelled more than all who preceded me in Jerusalem. My wisdom also remained with me. 
ECC.2.10	Whatever my eyes looked at with desire I did not refuse them. I did not withhold from my heart any pleasure, for my heart was pleased because of all my labor; and this was my reward for all my labor. 
ECC.2.11	Then I considered all which my hands had done and labored to do, and behold, all was vanity and chasing after the wind and there was no profit (nothing of lasting value) under the sun.
ECC.2.12	So I turned to consider [secular] wisdom, madness, and folly; for what will the man do who succeeds the king? Nothing 
ECC.2.13	Then I saw that [even secular] wisdom [that brings sorrow] is better than [the pleasures of] folly 
ECC.2.14	The wise man’s eyes are in his head, but the fool walks in darkness; and yet I know that [in the end] one fate happens to them both. 
ECC.2.15	Then I said to myself, “As it happens to the fool, so death will also happen to me. What use is it then for me to be extremely wise?” Then I said in my heart, “This too is vanity (meaningless).” 
ECC.2.16	For there is no [more] lasting remembrance of the wise man than of the fool, since in the days to come all will be long forgotten. And how does the wise man die? Even as the fool! 
ECC.2.17	So I hated life, for the work which had been done under the sun caused me only great sorrow; because all is futility and chasing after the wind.
ECC.2.18	So I hated all the fruit (gain) of my labor for which I had labored under the sun, because I must leave it to the man who will succeed me. 
ECC.2.19	And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have control over all the fruit of my labor for which I have labored by acting wisely under the sun. This too is vanity (futility, self-conceit). 
ECC.2.20	So I turned aside and let my heart despair over all the fruit of my labor for which I had labored under the sun. 
ECC.2.21	For there is a man who has labored with wisdom and knowledge and skill, yet gives his legacy to one who has not labored for it. This too is vanity and a great evil. 
ECC.2.22	For what does a man get from all his labor and from the striving 
ECC.2.23	For all his days his work is painful and sorrowful; even at night his mind does not rest. This too is vanity (worthless).
ECC.2.24	There is nothing better for a man than to eat and drink and assure himself that there is good in his labor. Even this, I have seen, is from the hand of God. 
ECC.2.25	For who can eat and who can have enjoyment without Him? 
ECC.2.26	For to the person who pleases Him God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner He gives the work of gathering and collecting so that he may give to one who pleases God. This too is vanity and chasing after the wind.
ECC.3.1	There is a season (a time appointed) for everything and a time for every delight 
ECC.3.2	A time to be born and a time to die;
ECC.3.2	A time to plant and a time to uproot what is planted.
ECC.3.3	A time to kill and a time to heal;
ECC.3.3	A time to tear down and a time to build up.
ECC.3.4	A time to weep and a time to laugh;
ECC.3.4	A time to mourn and a time to dance.
ECC.3.5	A time to throw away stones and a time to gather stones;
ECC.3.5	A time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing.
ECC.3.6	A time to search and a time to give up as lost;
ECC.3.6	A time to keep and a time to throw away.
ECC.3.7	A time to 
ECC.3.7	A time to keep silent and a time to speak.
ECC.3.8	A time to love and a time to hate;
ECC.3.8	A time for war and a time for peace.
ECC.3.9	What profit is there for the worker from that in which he labors? 
ECC.3.10	I have seen the task which God has given to the sons of men with which to occupy themselves.
ECC.3.11	He has made everything beautiful 
ECC.3.12	I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and to do good as long as they live; 
ECC.3.13	and also that every man should eat and drink and see 
ECC.3.14	I know that whatever God does, it endures forever; nothing can be added to it nor can anything be taken from it, for God does it so that men will fear 
ECC.3.15	That which is has already been, and that which will be has already been, for God seeks what has passed by [so that history repeats itself].
ECC.3.16	Moreover, I have seen under the sun that in the place of justice there is wickedness, and in the place of righteousness there is wickedness. 
ECC.3.17	I said to myself, “God will judge both the righteous and the wicked,” for there is a time [appointed] for every matter and for every deed. 
ECC.3.18	I said to myself regarding the sons of men, “God is surely testing them in order for them to see that [by themselves, without God] they are [only] animals.” 
ECC.3.19	For the [earthly] fate of the sons of men and the fate of animals is the same. As one dies, so dies the other; indeed, they all have the same breath and there is no preeminence 
ECC.3.20	All go to the same place. All came from the dust and all return to the dust. 
ECC.3.21	Who knows if the spirit of man ascends upward and the spirit of the animal descends downward to the earth? 
ECC.3.22	So I have seen that there is nothing better than that a man should be happy in his own works 
ECC.4.1	Then I looked again 
ECC.4.2	So I congratulated 
ECC.4.3	But better off than either of them is the one who has not yet been born, who has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun.
ECC.4.4	I have seen that every [effort in] labor and every skill in work 
ECC.4.5	The fool folds his hands [together] and consumes his own flesh [destroying himself by idleness and apathy]. 
ECC.4.6	One hand full of rest 
ECC.4.7	Then I looked again at vanity under the sun [in one of its peculiar forms]. 
ECC.4.8	There was a certain man—without a dependent, having neither a child nor a brother, yet there was no end to all his labor. Indeed, his eyes were not satisfied with riches 
ECC.4.9	Two are better than one because they have a more satisfying return for their labor; 
ECC.4.10	for if 
ECC.4.11	Again, if two lie down together, then they keep warm; but how can one be warm 
ECC.4.12	And though one can overpower him who is alone, two can resist him. A cord of three 
ECC.4.13	A poor yet wise youth is better than an old and foolish king who 
ECC.4.14	for the poor youth has [used his wisdom and] come out of prison to become king, even though he was born poor in his kingdom. 
ECC.4.15	I have seen all the living under the sun join with the second youth (the king’s acknowledged successor) who replaces him. 
ECC.4.16	There is no end to all the people; to all who were before them. Yet those who come later will not be happy with him. Surely this also is vanity (emptiness) and chasing after the wind.
ECC.5.1	Guard your steps 
ECC.5.2	Do not be hasty with your mouth [speaking careless words or vows] or impulsive in thought to bring up a matter before God. For God is in heaven and you are on earth; therefore let your words be few. 
ECC.5.3	For the dream comes through much effort, and the voice of the fool through many words.
ECC.5.4	When you make a vow 
ECC.5.5	It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay. 
ECC.5.6	Do not allow your speech to cause you to sin, and do not say before the messenger (priest) 
ECC.5.7	For in a multitude of dreams and in a flood of words there is worthlessness. Rather [reverently] fear God [and worship Him with awe-filled respect, knowing who He is].
ECC.5.8	If you see the oppression of the poor and the denial of justice and righteousness in the province, do not be shocked at the sight [of corruption]; for a higher official watches over another official, and there are higher ones over them [looking out for one another]. 
ECC.5.9	After all, a king who cultivates the field is an advantage to the land.
ECC.5.10	He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves abundance 
ECC.5.11	When good things increase, those who consume them increase. So what advantage is there to their owners except to see them with their eyes? 
ECC.5.12	The sleep of a working man is sweet, whether he eats little or much; but the full stomach (greed) of the rich [who hungers for even more] will not let him sleep.
ECC.5.13	There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun: riches being kept 
ECC.5.14	For when those riches are lost in bad investments and he becomes the father of a son, then there is nothing in his hand [for the support of the child]. 
ECC.5.15	As he came naked from his mother’s womb, so he will return as he came; and he will take away nothing from all his labor that he can carry in his hand. 
ECC.5.16	This also is a grievous evil—exactly as he was born, so he shall die. So what advantage has he who labors for the wind? 
ECC.5.17	All of his life he also eats in darkness [cheerlessly, without sweetness and light], with great frustration, sickness, and anger.
ECC.5.18	Behold, here is what I have seen to be good and fitting: to eat and drink, and to find enjoyment in all the labor in which he labors under the sun during the few days of his life which God gives him—for this is his [allotted] reward. 
ECC.5.19	Also, every man to whom God has given riches and possessions, He has also given the power 
ECC.5.20	For he will not often consider the [troubled] days of his life, because God keeps him occupied 
ECC.6.1	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it weighs heavily on men: 
ECC.6.2	a man to whom God has given riches and wealth and honor, so that he lacks nothing of all that he desires, yet God has not given him the power 
ECC.6.3	If a man fathers a hundred 
ECC.6.4	for the miscarriage comes in futility (in vain) and passes into obscurity; and its name is covered in obscurity. 
ECC.6.5	It has not seen the sun nor had any knowledge; yet it has more rest 
ECC.6.6	Even if the 
ECC.6.7	All the labor of man is for his mouth [for self-preservation and enjoyment], and yet the desire [of his soul] is not satisfied. 
ECC.6.8	For what advantage has the wise man over the fool [for being worldly-wise is not the secret to happiness]? What 
ECC.6.9	What the eyes see [enjoying what is available] is better than [craving] what the soul desires. This too is futility and chasing after the wind.
ECC.6.10	Whatever exists has already been named [long ago], and it is known what [a frail being] man is; for he cannot dispute with Him who is mightier than he. 
ECC.6.11	For there are many other words that increase futility. What then is the advantage for a man? 
ECC.6.12	For who [
ECC.7.1	A good name is better than precious perfume,
ECC.7.1	And the day of one’s death better than the day of one’s birth.
ECC.7.2	It is better to go to the house of mourning
ECC.7.2	Than to go to the house of feasting,
ECC.7.2	For that [day of death] is the end of every man,
ECC.7.2	And the living will take it to heart 
ECC.7.3	Sorrow is better than laughter,
ECC.7.3	For when a face is sad (deep in thought) the heart may be happy [because it is growing in wisdom].
ECC.7.4	The heart of the wise [learns when it] is in the house of mourning,
ECC.7.4	But the heart of fools is [senseless] in the house of pleasure.
ECC.7.5	It is better to listen to the rebuke of the wise man 
ECC.7.5	Than for one to listen to the song of fools 
ECC.7.6	For like the crackling of [burning] thorn bushes under a pot,
ECC.7.6	So is the laughter of the fool;
ECC.7.6	And this too is vanity (futility).
ECC.7.7	For oppression makes a wise man foolish,
ECC.7.7	And a bribe corrupts the [good judgment of the] heart.
ECC.7.8	The end of a matter is better than its beginning;
ECC.7.8	Patience of spirit is better than haughtiness of spirit (pride).
ECC.7.9	Do not be eager in your heart to be angry,
ECC.7.9	For anger dwells in the heart of fools.
ECC.7.10	Do not say, “Why were the old days better than these?”
ECC.7.10	For it is not from wisdom that you ask about this.
ECC.7.11	Wisdom along with an inheritance is good
ECC.7.11	And an [excellent] advantage for those who see the sun.
ECC.7.12	For wisdom is a protection 
ECC.7.12	But the [excellent] advantage of knowledge is that wisdom shields 
ECC.7.13	Consider the work of God:
ECC.7.13	Who can make straight what He has bent?
ECC.7.14	In the day of prosperity be joyful,
ECC.7.14	But in the day of adversity consider that
ECC.7.14	God has made the one as well as the other,
ECC.7.14	So that man will not find out anything 
ECC.7.15	I have seen everything during my [fleeting] days of futility; there is a righteous man who perishes in [spite of] his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who 
ECC.7.16	Do not be excessively righteous [like those given to self-conceit], and do not be overly wise (pretentious)—why should you bring yourself to ruin? 
ECC.7.17	Do not be excessively 
ECC.7.18	It is good that you take hold of one thing (righteousness) and also not let go of the other (wisdom); for the one who fears 
ECC.7.19	Wisdom strengthens the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city. 
ECC.7.20	Indeed, there is not a righteous man on earth who 
ECC.7.21	Also, do not take seriously everything that is said, so that you will not hear your servant cursing you, 
ECC.7.22	for you also know that you too have cursed others many times.
ECC.7.23	I have tested all this with wisdom. I said, “I will be wise [independently of God],” but true wisdom was far from me. 
ECC.7.24	Whatever has been is far off, deeply remote and exceedingly mysterious. Who can discover it [for it is beyond the grasp of man]? 
ECC.7.25	I turned around 
ECC.7.26	And I discovered that [of all irrational sins none has been so destructive in beguiling one away from God as immoral women for] more bitter than death is the woman whose heart is [composed of] snares and nets, and whose hands are chains. Whoever pleases God will escape from her, but the sinner will be taken captive by her [evil].
ECC.7.27	“Behold, I have discovered this,” says the Preacher, “while 
ECC.7.28	which I am still seeking but have not found. I have found one 
ECC.7.29	Behold, I have found only this [as a reason]: God made man upright 
ECC.8.1	Who is like the wise man?
ECC.8.1	And who knows the interpretation of a matter?
ECC.8.1	A man’s wisdom illumines his face,
ECC.8.1	And causes his stern face to beam.
ECC.8.2	I counsel you to keep the command of the king because of the oath before God [by which you swore loyalty to him]. 
ECC.8.3	Do not be in a hurry to get out of his presence. Do not join in a malevolent matter, for the king will do whatever he pleases.
ECC.8.4	For the word of a king is authoritative 
ECC.8.4	And who will say to him, “What are you doing?”
ECC.8.5	Whoever keeps 
ECC.8.5	For a wise heart will know the 
ECC.8.6	For there is a 
ECC.8.6	Though mankind’s misery 
ECC.8.7	For no one knows what will happen;
ECC.8.7	So who can tell him how 
ECC.8.8	There is no man who has power 
ECC.8.8	Nor does he have authority over the day of death;
ECC.8.8	There is no discharge [from service] during time of war,
ECC.8.8	And evil will not rescue those who [actively seek to] practice it.
ECC.8.9	All this I have seen while applying my mind to every deed that is done under the sun. There is a time in which one man has exercised power over others to their detriment.
ECC.8.10	So then, I have seen the wicked buried, those who used to go in and out of the holy place [but did not thereby escape their doom], and they are [praised in spite of their evil and] soon forgotten in the city where they did such things. This too is futility (vanity, emptiness). 
ECC.8.11	Because the sentence against an evil act is not executed quickly, the hearts of the sons of men are fully set to do evil. 
ECC.8.12	Though a sinner does evil a hundred 
ECC.8.13	But it will not be well for the evil man, nor will he lengthen his days like a shadow, because he does not fear God.
ECC.8.14	There is a meaningless 
ECC.8.15	Then I commended pleasure 
ECC.8.16	When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to see the activities [of mankind] that take place upon the earth—how some men seem to sleep neither day nor night— 
ECC.8.17	and I saw all the work of God, I 
ECC.9.1	For I have taken all this to heart, exploring 
ECC.9.2	It is the same for all. There is one fate for the righteous and for the wicked; for the good, for the clean and for the unclean; for the man who offers sacrifices and for the one who does not sacrifice. As the good man is, so is the sinner; as he who swears 
ECC.9.3	This evil is in all that is done under the sun, that one fate comes to all. Also, the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live, and afterwards they go to the dead. 
ECC.9.4	[There is no exemption,] but whoever is joined with all the living, has hope; surely a live dog is better than a dead lion. 
ECC.9.5	For the living know that they will die; but the dead know nothing, and they no longer have a reward [here], for the memory of them is forgotten. 
ECC.9.6	Indeed their love, their hatred and their zeal have already perished, and they will no longer have a share [in this age] in anything that is done under the sun.
ECC.9.7	Go 
ECC.9.8	Let your clothes always be white [with purity], and do not let the oil [of gladness] be lacking on your head. 
ECC.9.9	Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of your fleeting life which He has given you under the sun—all the days of vanity 
ECC.9.10	Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might; for there is no activity or planning or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead) where you are going.
ECC.9.11	I again saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift and the battle is not to the strong, and neither is bread to the wise nor riches to those of intelligence 
ECC.9.12	For man also does not know his time [of death]; like fish caught in a treacherous net, and birds caught in the snare, so the sons of men are ensnared in an evil time when a dark cloud suddenly falls on them.
ECC.9.13	This [illustration of] wisdom I have also seen under the sun, and great it was to me: 
ECC.9.14	There was a little city with few men in it and a great king came against it and besieged it and built great battlements against it. 
ECC.9.15	But there was found in it a poor wise man, and by his wisdom he rescued the city. Yet no man [seriously] remembered that poor man. 
ECC.9.16	But I say that wisdom is better than strength, though the poor man’s wisdom is despised and his words are not heeded. 
ECC.9.17	The words of wise men heard in quietness are 
ECC.9.18	Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.
ECC.10.1	Dead flies make the oil of the perfumer give off a foul odor; so a little foolishness [in one who is esteemed] outweighs wisdom and honor. 
ECC.10.2	A wise man’s heart 
ECC.10.3	Even when a fool walks along the road, his [common] sense 
ECC.10.4	If the temper of the ruler rises against you, do not leave your post [showing resistance], because composure 
ECC.10.5	There is an evil I have seen under the sun, like an error which proceeds from the ruler— 
ECC.10.6	folly is set in many exalted places 
ECC.10.7	I have seen slaves 
ECC.10.8	He who digs a pit [for others] may fall into it, and a serpent may bite him who breaks through a [stone] wall. 
ECC.10.9	He who quarries stones may be hurt with them, and he who splits logs may be endangered by them. 
ECC.10.10	If the axe is dull and he does not sharpen its edge, then he must exert more strength; but wisdom [to sharpen the axe] helps him succeed [with less effort]. 
ECC.10.11	If the serpent bites before being charmed, then there is no profit for the charmer. 
ECC.10.12	The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious 
ECC.10.13	the beginning of 
ECC.10.14	Yet the fool multiplies words, though no man knows what will happen, and who can tell him what will come after he is gone? 
ECC.10.15	The labor of a fool so wearies him [because he is ignorant] that he does not even know how to go to a city. 
ECC.10.16	Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child and when your [incompetent] officials 
ECC.10.17	Blessed [prosperous and admired] are you, O land, when your king is a man of noble birth, and your princes 
ECC.10.18	Through laziness the rafters [of state affairs] decay 
ECC.10.19	 make a feast for enjoyment [instead of repairing what is broken], and serve wine to make life merry, and money is the answer to everything. 
ECC.10.20	Moreover, do not curse the king, even in your bedroom, and in your sleeping rooms do not curse the rich, for a bird of the air will carry the sound and a winged creature will make the matter known.
ECC.11.1	Cast your bread on the surface of the waters, [be diligently active, make thoughtful decisions], for you will 
ECC.11.2	Give a portion to seven, or even [divide it] to eight, for you do not know what misfortune may occur on the earth. 
ECC.11.3	If the clouds are full [of rain], they empty themselves on the earth; and if a tree falls toward the south or toward the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it lies. 
ECC.11.4	He who watches the wind [waiting for all conditions to be perfect] will not sow [seed], and he who looks at the clouds will not reap [a harvest]. 
ECC.11.5	Just as you do not know the way 
ECC.11.6	Sow your seed in the morning and do not be idle with your hands in the evening, for you do not know whether morning or evening planting will succeed, whether this or that, or whether both alike will be good.
ECC.11.7	The light is sweet 
ECC.11.8	Yes, if a man should live many years, let him rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness, for they will be many. All that is to come will be futility.
ECC.11.9	Rejoice, young man, in your childhood, and let your heart be pleasant in the days of your young manhood. And walk in the ways of your heart and in the desires of your eyes, but know that God will bring you into judgment for all these things. 
ECC.11.10	Therefore, remove sorrow and anger from your heart and put away pain from your body, for childhood and the prime of life are fleeting.
ECC.12.1	Remember [thoughtfully] also your Creator in the days of your youth [for you are not your own, but His], before the evil days come or the years draw near when you will say [of physical pleasures], “I have no enjoyment 
ECC.12.2	before the sun and the light, and the moon and the stars are darkened [by impaired vision], and the clouds [of depression] return after the rain [of tears]; 
ECC.12.3	in the day when the keepers of the house (hands, arms) tremble, and the strong men (feet, knees) bow themselves, and the grinders (molar teeth) cease because they are few, and those (eyes) who look through the windows grow dim; 
ECC.12.4	when the doors (lips) are shut in the streets and the sound of the grinding [of the teeth] is low, and one rises at the sound of a bird 
ECC.12.5	Furthermore, they are afraid of a high place and of dangers on the road; the almond tree (hair) blossoms [white], and the grasshopper (a little thing) is a burden, and the 
ECC.12.6	 before the silver cord [of life] is broken, or the golden bowl is crushed, or the pitcher at the fountain is shattered and the wheel at the cistern is crushed; 
ECC.12.7	then the dust [out of which God made man’s body] will return to the earth as it was, and the spirit will return to God who gave it. 
ECC.12.8	“Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher. “All [that is done without God’s guidance] is vanity (futility).”
ECC.12.9	Furthermore, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; and he pondered and searched out and arranged many proverbs. 
ECC.12.10	The Preacher sought to find delightful words, even to write correctly words of truth.
ECC.12.11	The words of the wise are like [prodding] goads, and 
ECC.12.12	But beyond this my son, [about going further than the words given by one Shepherd], be warned: the writing of many books is endless [so do not believe everything you read], and excessive study 
ECC.12.13	When all has been heard, the end of the matter is: fear God [worship Him with awe-filled reverence, knowing that He is almighty God] and keep His commandments, for this applies to every person. 
ECC.12.14	For God will bring every act to judgment, every hidden

SNG.3.4	When I found him whom my soul loves.
SNG.3.4	I held on to him and would not let him go
SNG.3.4	Until I had brought him to my mother’s house,
SNG.3.4	And into the chamber of her who conceived me.”
SNG.3.5	“I command that you take an oath, O daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.3.5	By the gazelles or by the does of the field,
SNG.3.5	That you do not rouse nor awaken my love
SNG.3.5	Until she pleases.”
SNG.3.6	“What is this coming up from the wilderness
SNG.3.6	Like [stately] pillars of smoke
SNG.3.6	Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,
SNG.3.6	With all the fragrant powders of the merchant?”
SNG.3.7	“Behold, it is the couch (
SNG.3.7	Sixty mighty men around it,
SNG.3.7	Of the mighty men of Israel.
SNG.3.8	All of them handle the sword,
SNG.3.8	All expert in war;
SNG.3.8	Each man has his sword at his thigh,
SNG.3.9	King Solomon has made for himself a palanquin
SNG.3.9	From the [cedar] wood of Lebanon.
SNG.3.10	He made its posts of silver,
SNG.3.10	Its back of gold,
SNG.3.10	Its seat of purple cloth,
SNG.3.10	The interior lovingly 
SNG.3.10	By the daughters of Jerusalem.
SNG.3.11	Go forth, O daughters of Zion,
SNG.3.11	And gaze on King Solomon wearing the crown
SNG.3.11	With which his mother [Bathsheba] has crowned him
SNG.3.11	On the day of his wedding,
SNG.3.11	On the day of his gladness of heart.”
SNG.4.1	“How fair 
SNG.4.1	How very beautiful!
SNG.4.1	Your eyes behind your veil are like those of a dove;
SNG.4.1	Your hair is like [the shimmering black fleece of] a flock of [Arabian] goats
SNG.4.1	That have descended from Mount Gilead [beyond the Jordan].
SNG.4.2	Your teeth are like a flock of 
SNG.4.2	Which have come up from washing,
SNG.4.2	All of which bear twins,
SNG.4.2	And not one among them has lost her young.
SNG.4.3	Your lips are like a ribbon of scarlet,
SNG.4.3	And your mouth is lovely.
SNG.4.3	Your temples are like a slice of the pomegranate
SNG.4.3	Behind your veil.
SNG.4.4	Your neck is like the tower of David,
SNG.4.4	Built with rows of [glistening] stones,
SNG.4.4	Whereon hang a thousand shields,
SNG.4.4	All of them shields of warriors.
SNG.4.5	Your two breasts are like two fawns,
SNG.4.5	Twins of a gazelle
SNG.4.5	Which feed among the lilies.
SNG.4.6	Until the day breaks
SNG.4.6	And the shadows flee away,
SNG.4.6	[In my thoughts] I will go my way to the mountain of myrrh
SNG.4.6	And to the hill of frankincense.
SNG.4.7	“O my love, you are altogether beautiful 
SNG.4.7	There is no flaw 
SNG.4.8	May you come with me from Lebanon.
SNG.4.8	Journey down from the top of Amana,
SNG.4.8	From the summit of Senir and Hermon,
SNG.4.8	From the dens of lions,
SNG.4.8	From the mountains of leopards.
SNG.4.9	You have ravished my heart 
SNG.4.9	You have ravished my heart 
SNG.4.9	With one jewel of your necklace.
SNG.4.10	How beautiful is your love, my sister, my [promised] bride!
SNG.4.10	How much better is your love than wine,
SNG.4.10	And the fragrance of your oils
SNG.4.10	Than all 
SNG.4.11	Your lips, my [promised] bride, drip honey [as the honeycomb];
SNG.4.11	Honey and milk are under your tongue,
SNG.4.11	And the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
SNG.4.12	A garden enclosed is my sister, my [promised] bride—
SNG.4.12	A rock garden locked, a spring sealed up.
SNG.4.13	Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates,
SNG.4.13	[A paradise] with precious fruits, henna with fragrant plants,
SNG.4.14	Fragrant plants and saffron, calamus and cinnamon,
SNG.4.14	With all trees of frankincense,
SNG.4.14	Myrrh and aloes, along with all the finest spices.
SNG.4.15	A well of fresh 
SNG.4.15	And streams 
SNG.4.16	“Awake, O north 
SNG.4.16	And come, south 
SNG.4.16	Make my garden breathe out 
SNG.4.16	Let its spices flow forth.
SNG.4.16	Let my beloved come into his garden
SNG.4.16	And eat its choicest fruits.”
SNG.5.1	“I have come into my garden, my sister, my [promised] bride;
SNG.5.1	I have gathered my myrrh along with my balsam 
SNG.5.1	I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey;
SNG.5.1	I have drunk my wine with my milk.
SNG.5.1	Eat, friends;
SNG.5.1	Drink and drink deeply, O lovers.”
SNG.5.2	“I was asleep, but my heart was awake.
SNG.5.2	A voice [in my dream]! My beloved was knocking:
SNG.5.2	‘Open to me, my sister, my darling,
SNG.5.2	My dove, my perfect one!
SNG.5.2	For my head is drenched with the [heavy night] dew;
SNG.5.2	My hair [is covered] with the dampness of the night.’
SNG.5.3	I had taken off my dress,
SNG.5.3	How can I put it on 
SNG.5.3	I had washed my feet,
SNG.5.3	How could I get them dirty 
SNG.5.4	My beloved extended his hand through the opening [of the door],
SNG.5.4	And my feelings were aroused for him.
SNG.5.5	I arose to open for my beloved;
SNG.5.5	And my hands dripped with myrrh,
SNG.5.5	And my fingers with liquid [sweet-scented] myrrh,
SNG.5.5	On the handles of the bolt.
SNG.5.6	I opened for my beloved,
SNG.5.6	But my beloved had turned away and was gone.
SNG.5.6	My heart went out 
SNG.5.6	I searched for him, but I could not find him;
SNG.5.6	I called him, but he did not answer me.
SNG.5.7	The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me.
SNG.5.7	They struck me, they wounded me;
SNG.5.7	The guardsmen of the walls took my shawl from me.
SNG.5.8	I command that you take an oath, O daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.5.8	If you find my beloved,
SNG.5.8	As to what you tell him—
SNG.5.8	[Say that] I am sick from love [sick from being without him].”
SNG.5.9	“What is your beloved more than another beloved,
SNG.5.9	O most beautiful among women?
SNG.5.9	What is your beloved more than another beloved,
SNG.5.9	That you should so command us to take an oath?”
SNG.5.10	“My beloved is exquisitely handsome and ruddy,
SNG.5.10	Outstanding among ten thousand.
SNG.5.11	His head is 
SNG.5.11	His hair is [curly] 
SNG.5.11	And black as a raven.
SNG.5.12	His eyes are like doves
SNG.5.12	Beside streams of water,
SNG.5.12	Bathed in milk
SNG.5.12	And reposed in their setting.
SNG.5.13	His cheeks are like a bed of balsam,
SNG.5.13	Banks of sweet, fragrant herbs.
SNG.5.13	His lips are lilies
SNG.5.13	Dripping 
SNG.5.14	His hands are rods of gold
SNG.5.14	Set with beryl;
SNG.5.14	His abdomen is a figure of carved ivory
SNG.5.14	Inlaid with sapphires.
SNG.5.15	His legs are [strong and steady] pillars of alabaster
SNG.5.15	Set upon pedestals of fine gold.
SNG.5.15	His appearance is like Lebanon,
SNG.5.15	Stately 
SNG.5.16	His mouth is 
SNG.5.16	Yes, he is altogether lovely 
SNG.5.16	This is my beloved and this is my friend,
SNG.5.16	O daughters of Jerusalem.”
SNG.6.1	“Where has your beloved gone,
SNG.6.1	O most beautiful among women?
SNG.6.1	Where is your beloved hiding himself,
SNG.6.1	That we may seek him with you?”
SNG.6.2	“My beloved has gone down to his garden,
SNG.6.2	To the beds of balsam,
SNG.6.2	To feed 
SNG.6.2	And gather lilies.
SNG.6.3	I am my beloved’s and my beloved is mine,
SNG.6.3	He who feeds 
SNG.6.4	“You are as beautiful as 
SNG.6.4	As lovely as Jerusalem,
SNG.6.4	As majestic as an army with banners!
SNG.6.5	Turn your [flashing] eyes away from me,
SNG.6.5	For they have confused 
SNG.6.5	Your hair is like [the shimmering black fleece of] a flock of [Arabian] goats
SNG.6.5	That have descended from Mount Gilead.
SNG.6.6	Your teeth are like a flock of ewes
SNG.6.6	Which have come up from their washing,
SNG.6.6	All of which bear twins,
SNG.6.6	And not one among them has lost her young.
SNG.6.7	Your temples are like a slice of the pomegranate
SNG.6.7	Behind your veil.
SNG.6.8	There are sixty queens and eighty 
SNG.6.8	And maidens without number;
SNG.6.9	But my dove, my perfect one, stands alone [above them all];
SNG.6.9	She is her mother’s only 
SNG.6.9	She is the pure 
SNG.6.9	The maidens saw her and called her blessed 
SNG.6.9	The queens and the concubines also, and they praised her, 
SNG.6.10	‘Who is this that looks down like the dawn,
SNG.6.10	Fair 
SNG.6.10	Clear 
SNG.6.10	As majestic as an army with banners?’
SNG.6.11	I went down to the orchard of nut trees
SNG.6.11	To see the flowers of the valley,
SNG.6.11	To see whether the grapevine had budded
SNG.6.11	And the pomegranates were in flower.
SNG.6.12	Before I was aware [of what was happening], my desire had brought me
SNG.6.12	Into the area of the princes of my people [the king’s retinue].”
SNG.6.13	“Return, return, O Shulammite;
SNG.6.13	Return, return, that we may gaze at you.”
SNG.6.13	“
SNG.6.13	As at the dance of the two armies?
SNG.7.1	“How beautiful are your feet in sandals,
SNG.7.1	O prince’s daughter!
SNG.7.1	The curves of your hips are like jewels,
SNG.7.1	The work of the hands of an artist.
SNG.7.2	Your navel is a round goblet
SNG.7.2	Which never lacks mixed wine.
SNG.7.2	Your belly is like a heap of wheat
SNG.7.2	Surrounded with lilies.
SNG.7.3	Your two breasts are like two fawns,
SNG.7.3	The twins of a gazelle.
SNG.7.4	Your neck is like a tower of ivory,
SNG.7.4	Your eyes the [sparkling] pools of Heshbon
SNG.7.4	By the gate of Bath-rabbim.
SNG.7.4	Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon
SNG.7.4	Which looks toward Damascus.
SNG.7.5	Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel,
SNG.7.5	And the flowing hair of your head like purple threads;
SNG.7.5	I, the king, am held captive by your 
SNG.7.6	How beautiful and how delightful you are,
SNG.7.6	My love, with all your delights!
SNG.7.7	Your stature is like that of a palm tree
SNG.7.7	And your breasts 
SNG.7.8	I said, ‘I will climb the palm tree;
SNG.7.8	I will grasp its branches.
SNG.7.8	Let your breasts be like clusters of the grapevine,
SNG.7.8	And the fragrance of your breath like apples,
SNG.7.9	And your kisses like the best wine!’ ”
SNG.7.9	“
SNG.7.9	Gliding gently over his lips while he sleeps.
SNG.7.10	“I am my beloved’s,
SNG.7.10	And his desire is for me.
SNG.7.11	Come, my beloved, let us go out into the country,
SNG.7.11	Let us spend the night in the villages.
SNG.7.12	Let us go out early to the vineyards;
SNG.7.12	Let us see whether the vine has budded
SNG.7.12	There I will give you my love.
SNG.7.13	The mandrakes give forth fragrance,
SNG.7.13	And over our doors are all [kinds of] choice 
SNG.7.13	Both new and old,
SNG.7.13	Which I have saved up for you, my beloved.
SNG.8.1	“Oh, that you were like a brother to me,
SNG.8.1	Who nursed at the breasts of my mother.
SNG.8.1	If I found you out of doors, I would kiss you;
SNG.8.1	No one would blame me 
SNG.8.2	I would lead you and bring you
SNG.8.2	Into the house of my mother, who used to instruct me;
SNG.8.2	I would give you spiced wine to drink from the juice of my pomegranates.
SNG.8.3	Let his left hand be under my head
SNG.8.3	And his right hand embrace me.”
SNG.8.4	“I command you to take an oath, O daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.8.4	That you do not rouse nor awaken my love
SNG.8.4	Until she pleases.”
SNG.8.5	“Who is this coming up from the wilderness
SNG.8.5	Leaning upon her beloved?”
SNG.8.5	“
SNG.8.5	There your mother was in labor with you,
SNG.8.5	There she was in labor and gave you birth.
SNG.8.6	Put me like a seal on your heart,
SNG.8.6	Like a seal on your arm;
SNG.8.6	For love is as strong as death,
SNG.8.6	Jealousy is as severe 
SNG.8.6	Its flashes are flashes of fire,
SNG.8.6	[A most vehement flame] the very flame of the 
SNG.8.7	Many waters cannot quench love,
SNG.8.7	Nor can rivers drown it.
SNG.8.7	If a man would offer all the riches of his house for love,
SNG.8.7	It would be utterly scorned 
SNG.8.8	“We have a little sister
SNG.8.8	And she has no breasts.
SNG.8.8	What shall we do for our sister
SNG.8.8	On the day when she is spoken for [in marriage]?
SNG.8.9	If she is a wall (discreet, womanly),
SNG.8.9	We will build on her a turret (dowry) of silver;
SNG.8.9	But if she is a door (bold, flirtatious),
SNG.8.9	We will enclose her with planks of cedar.”
SNG.8.10	“I was a wall, and my breasts were like the towers.
SNG.8.10	Then I became in the king’s eyes
SNG.8.10	As one [to be respected and allowed] to find peace.
SNG.8.11	Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon;
SNG.8.11	He entrusted the vineyard to caretakers;
SNG.8.11	Each one was to bring him a thousand 
SNG.8.12	My very own vineyard is at my disposal;
SNG.8.12	The thousand [shekels of silver] are for you, O Solomon,
SNG.8.12	And two hundred are for those who tend the fruit.”
SNG.8.13	“O you who sit in the gardens,
SNG.8.13	My companions are listening for your voice—
SNG.8.13	Let me hear it.”
SNG.8.14	“Hurry, my beloved 
SNG.8.14	Like a gazelle or a young stag [taking me home]
SNG.8.14	On the mountains of spices.”
ISA.1.1	The vision of [the prophet] Isaiah the son of Amoz concerning [the kingdom of] Judah and [its capital] Jerusalem, which he saw [as revealed by God] during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
ISA.1.2	Hear, O heavens, and listen, O earth;
ISA.1.2	For the L
ISA.1.2	“I have reared and brought up sons,
ISA.1.2	But they have rebelled against Me 
ISA.1.3	The ox [instinctively] knows its owner,
ISA.1.3	And the donkey its master’s feeding trough,
ISA.1.3	But Israel does not know [Me as L
ISA.1.3	My people do not understand.”
ISA.1.4	Ah, sinful nation,
ISA.1.4	A people loaded down with wickedness [with sin, with injustice, with wrongdoing],
ISA.1.4	Offspring of evildoers,
ISA.1.4	Sons who behave corruptly!
ISA.1.4	They have abandoned (rejected) the L
ISA.1.4	They have despised the Holy One of Israel [provoking Him to anger],
ISA.1.4	They have turned away from Him.
ISA.1.5	Why should you be stricken 
ISA.1.5	You [only] continue to rebel.
ISA.1.5	The whole head is sick
ISA.1.5	And the whole heart is faint 
ISA.1.6	From the sole of the foot even to the head
ISA.1.6	There is nothing healthy in the nation’s body,
ISA.1.6	Only bruises, welts, and raw wounds,
ISA.1.6	Not pressed out or bandaged,
ISA.1.6	Nor softened with oil [as a remedy].
ISA.1.7	Your land lies desolate [because of your disobedience],
ISA.1.7	Your cities are burned with fire,
ISA.1.7	Your fields—strangers are devouring them in your very presence;
ISA.1.7	It is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
ISA.1.8	The Daughter of Zion (Jerusalem) is left like a [deserted] shelter in a vineyard,
ISA.1.8	Like a watchman’s hut in a cucumber field, like a besieged city [isolated, surrounded by devastation].
ISA.1.9	If the L
ISA.1.9	Had not left us a few survivors,
ISA.1.9	We would be like Sodom,
ISA.1.9	We would be like Gomorrah.
ISA.1.10	Hear the word of the L
ISA.1.10	You rulers of [another] Sodom,
ISA.1.10	Listen to the law 
ISA.1.10	You people of [another] Gomorrah.
ISA.1.11	“What are your multiplied sacrifices to Me [without your repentance]?”
ISA.1.11	Says the L
ISA.1.11	“I have had enough of [your] burnt offerings of rams
ISA.1.11	And the fat of well-fed cattle [without your obedience];
ISA.1.11	And I take no pleasure in the blood of bulls or lambs or goats [offered without repentance].
ISA.1.12	When you come to appear before Me,
ISA.1.12	Who requires this of you, this trampling of My [temple] courts [by your sinful feet]?
ISA.1.13	Do not bring worthless offerings again,
ISA.1.13	[Your] incense is repulsive to Me;
ISA.1.13	[Your] New Moon and Sabbath [observances], the calling of assemblies—
ISA.1.13	I cannot endure wickedness [your sin, your injustice, your wrongdoing] and [the squalor of] the festive assembly.
ISA.1.14	I hate [the hypocrisy of] your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts.
ISA.1.14	They have become a burden to Me;
ISA.1.14	I am weary of bearing them.
ISA.1.15	So when you spread out your hands [in prayer, pleading for My help],
ISA.1.15	I will hide My eyes from you;
ISA.1.15	Yes, even though you offer many prayers,
ISA.1.15	I will not be listening.
ISA.1.15	Your hands are full of blood!
ISA.1.16	“Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean;
ISA.1.16	Get your evil deeds out of My sight.
ISA.1.16	Stop doing evil,
ISA.1.17	Learn to do good.
ISA.1.17	Seek justice,
ISA.1.17	Rebuke the ruthless,
ISA.1.17	Defend the fatherless,
ISA.1.17	Plead for the [rights of the] widow [in court].
ISA.1.18	“Come now, and let us reason together,”
ISA.1.18	Says the L
ISA.1.18	“
ISA.1.18	They shall be as white as snow;
ISA.1.18	Though they are red like crimson,
ISA.1.18	They shall be like wool.
ISA.1.19	If you are willing and obedient,
ISA.1.19	You shall eat the best of the land;
ISA.1.20	But if you refuse and rebel,
ISA.1.20	You shall be devoured by the sword.”
ISA.1.20	For the mouth of the L
ISA.1.21	How the faithful city has become a prostitute [idolatrous, despicable],
ISA.1.21	She who was full of justice!
ISA.1.21	Right standing with God once lodged in her,
ISA.1.21	But now murderers.
ISA.1.22	Your silver has turned to 
ISA.1.22	Your wine is diluted with water.
ISA.1.23	Your rulers are rebels
ISA.1.23	And companions of thieves;
ISA.1.23	Everyone loves bribes
ISA.1.23	And chases after gifts.
ISA.1.23	They do not defend the fatherless,
ISA.1.23	Nor does the widow’s cause come before them [instead they delay or turn a deaf ear].
ISA.1.24	Therefore the Lord G
ISA.1.24	The Mighty One of Israel, declares:
ISA.1.24	“Ah, I will be freed of My adversaries
ISA.1.24	And avenge Myself on My enemies.
ISA.1.25	And I will turn My hand against you,
ISA.1.25	And will [thoroughly] purge away your dross as with lye
ISA.1.25	And remove all your tin (impurity).
ISA.1.26	Then I will restore your judges as at the first,
ISA.1.26	And your counselors as at the beginning;
ISA.1.26	Afterward you will be called the city of righteousness,
ISA.1.26	The faithful city.”
ISA.1.27	Zion will be redeemed with justice
ISA.1.27	And her repentant ones with righteousness.
ISA.1.28	But rebels and sinners will be crushed 
ISA.1.28	And those who abandon (turn away from) the L
ISA.1.29	For you will be ashamed [of the degradation] of the oaks in which you took [idolatrous] pleasure,
ISA.1.29	And you will be ashamed of the gardens [of passion] which you have chosen [for pagan worship].
ISA.1.30	For you will be like an oak whose leaf withers 
ISA.1.30	And like a garden that has no water.
ISA.1.31	The strong man will become tinder,
ISA.1.31	And his work a spark.
ISA.1.31	So both will burn together
ISA.1.31	And there will be none to quench them.
ISA.2.1	The word [from God] which Isaiah son of Amoz saw [in a vision] concerning [the nation of] Judah and [its capital city] Jerusalem.
ISA.2.2	Now it will come to pass that
ISA.2.2	In the last days
ISA.2.2	The mountain of the house of the L
ISA.2.2	Will be [firmly] established as the 
ISA.2.2	And will be exalted above the hills;
ISA.2.2	And all the nations will stream to it.
ISA.2.3	And many peoples shall come and say,
ISA.2.3	“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the L
ISA.2.3	To the house (temple) of the God of Jacob;
ISA.2.3	That He may teach us His ways
ISA.2.3	And that we may walk in His paths.”
ISA.2.3	For the law will go out from Zion
ISA.2.3	And the word of the L
ISA.2.4	And He will judge between the nations,
ISA.2.4	And will mediate [disputes] for many peoples;
ISA.2.4	And they will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks.
ISA.2.4	Nation will not lift up the sword against nation,
ISA.2.4	And never again will they learn war.
ISA.2.5	O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the L
ISA.2.6	Most certainly [L
ISA.2.6	Because they are filled 
ISA.2.6	And they are soothsayers [who foretell] like the Philistines;
ISA.2.6	Also they strike 
ISA.2.7	Their land has also been filled with silver and gold
ISA.2.7	And there is no end to their treasures;
ISA.2.7	Their land has also been filled with horses
ISA.2.7	And there is no end to their chariots.
ISA.2.8	Their land has also been filled with idols;
ISA.2.8	They worship the work of their hands,
ISA.2.8	That which their own fingers have made.
ISA.2.9	So the

ISA.2.9	Therefore do not forgive them [O L
ISA.2.10	Go among the rocks and hide in the dust
ISA.2.10	From the terror of the L
ISA.2.11	The proud look of man will be degraded
ISA.2.11	And the arrogance of men will be humbled,

ISA.2.12	For the L
ISA.2.12	Against all who are proud and arrogant
ISA.2.12	And against all who are lifted up,
ISA.2.12	That they may be degraded.
ISA.2.13	And the wrath of God will be against all the cedars of Lebanon [west of the Jordan] that are high and lifted up,
ISA.2.13	Against all the oaks of Bashan [east of the Jordan],
ISA.2.14	Against all the high mountains,
ISA.2.14	Against all the hills that are lifted up,
ISA.2.15	Against every high tower,
ISA.2.15	Against every fortified wall,
ISA.2.16	Against all the ships of Tarshish
ISA.2.16	And against all the beautiful craft.
ISA.2.17	Then the pride of man will be humbled
ISA.2.17	And the arrogance of men will be degraded;
ISA.2.17	The L
ISA.2.18	And the idols will completely vanish (be abolished).
ISA.2.19	They [the stricken, deprived of all in which they had trusted] will go into the caves of the rocks
ISA.2.19	And into the holes of the ground [fleeing]
ISA.2.19	From the terror 
ISA.2.19	And from the splendor of His majesty,

ISA.2.20	In that day men will throw away to the moles and to the bats
ISA.2.20	Their idols of silver and their idols of gold,
ISA.2.20	Which they made for themselves [as objects] to worship,
ISA.2.21	To go into the caverns of the rocks and into the clefts of the [ragged] cliffs [as they flee]
ISA.2.21	From the terror 
ISA.2.21	When He arises to terrify the earth.
ISA.2.22	Stop regarding man, whose breath [of life] is in his nostrils [for so little time];
ISA.2.22	For why should he be esteemed?
ISA.3.1	Listen carefully, the Lord G

ISA.3.1	And the whole supply of water;

ISA.3.5	And the vulgar (common) toward the honorable [person of rank].
ISA.3.6	When a man takes hold of his brother in the house of his father, 
ISA.3.6	“You have a robe, you shall be our judge 
ISA.3.6	And this pile of ruins will be under your control,”
ISA.3.7	He will protest on that day, saying,

ISA.3.24	Now it will come to pass that instead of the sweet fragrance of spices there will be [the stench of] rottenness;
ISA.3.24	Instead of a belt, a rope;
ISA.3.24	Instead of well-set hair, baldness;
ISA.3.24	Instead of fine clothes, a robe of sackcloth;
ISA.3.24	And branding [of captives by the scorching heat] instead of beauty.
ISA.3.25	Your men will fall by the sword

ISA.4.3	It will come to pass that he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy (set apart for God)—everyone who is recorded for [eternal] life in Jerusalem.

ISA.4.5	then the L

ISA.5.1	Now let me sing for my greatly Beloved [L
ISA.5.1	A song of my Beloved about His vineyard (His chosen people).
ISA.5.1	My greatly Beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile slope (the promised land, Canaan).
ISA.5.2	He dug it all around and cleared away its stones,
ISA.5.2	And planted it with 
ISA.5.2	And He built a tower in the center of it;
ISA.5.2	And also hewed out a 
ISA.5.2	Then He expected it to produce [the choicest] grapes,
ISA.5.2	But it produced 
ISA.5.3	“And now, 
ISA.5.3	Judge between Me and My vineyard (My people).
ISA.5.4	What more could have been done for My vineyard that I have not done in it?
ISA.5.4	When I expected it to produce 
ISA.5.5	So now let me tell you what I am going to do to My vineyard:
ISA.5.5	I will take away its thorn-hedge, and it will be burned up;
ISA.5.5	I will break down its 
ISA.5.6	I will turn it into a wasteland;
ISA.5.6	It will not be pruned or cultivated,
ISA.5.6	But briars and thorns will come up.
ISA.5.6	I will also command the clouds not to rain on it.”
ISA.5.7	For the vineyard of the L
ISA.5.7	And the men of Judah are His delightful planting [which He loves].
ISA.5.7	So He looked for justice, but in fact, [He saw] bloodshed 
ISA.5.7	[He looked] for righteousness, but in fact, [He heard] a cry of distress 
ISA.5.8	Woe (judgment is coming) to those who join house to house and join field to field [to increase their holdings by depriving others],
ISA.5.8	Until there is no more room [for others],
ISA.5.8	So that you have to live alone in the midst of the land!
ISA.5.9	In my ears the L
ISA.5.10	For ten 
ISA.5.10	And a homer (
ISA.5.11	Woe (judgment is coming) to those who rise early in the morning to pursue intoxicating drink,
ISA.5.11	Who stay up late in the night till wine inflames them!
ISA.5.12	They have lyre and harp, tambourine and flute, and wine at their feasts;
ISA.5.12	But they do not regard 
ISA.5.12	Nor do they consider the work of His hands.
ISA.5.13	Therefore My people go into exile because they lack knowledge [of God];
ISA.5.13	And their honorable men are famished,
ISA.5.13	And their common people are parched with thirst.
ISA.5.14	Therefore Sheol (the realm of the dead) has increased its appetite and opened its mouth beyond measure;
ISA.5.14	And 
ISA.5.15	So the 
ISA.5.15	And the eyes of the proud (arrogant) will be degraded.
ISA.5.16	But the L
ISA.5.16	And God, the Holy One, will show Himself holy in righteousness [through His righteous judgments].
ISA.5.17	Then the lambs will graze [among the ruins] as in their own pasture,
ISA.5.17	And strangers will eat in the desolate places of the [exiled] wealthy.
ISA.5.18	Woe (judgment is coming) to those who drag along wickedness with cords of falsehood,
ISA.5.18	And sin as if with cart ropes [towing their own punishment];
ISA.5.19	Who say, “Let Him move speedily, let Him expedite His work [His promised vengeance], so that we may see it;
ISA.5.19	And let the purpose of the Holy One of Israel approach
ISA.5.19	And come to pass, so that we may know it!”
ISA.5.20	Woe (judgment is coming) to those who call evil good, and good evil;
ISA.5.20	Who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness;
ISA.5.20	Who substitute bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!
ISA.5.21	Woe (judgment is coming) to those who are wise in their own eyes
ISA.5.21	And clever 
ISA.5.22	Woe (judgment is coming) to those who are heroes at drinking wine
ISA.5.22	And men of strength in mixing intoxicating drinks,
ISA.5.23	Who justify the wicked 
ISA.5.23	And take away the rights of those who are in the right!
ISA.5.24	Therefore, as the tongue of fire consumes the stubble [from straw]
ISA.5.24	And the dry grass collapses into the flame,
ISA.5.24	So their root will become like rot and their blossom blow away like fine dust;
ISA.5.24	Because they have rejected the law of the L
ISA.5.24	And despised 
ISA.5.25	Therefore the anger of the L
ISA.5.25	And He has stretched out His hand against them and has struck them down.
ISA.5.25	And the mountains trembled, and their dead bodies lay like rubbish in the middle of the streets.
ISA.5.25	In 
ISA.5.25	But His hand is still stretched out [in judgment].
ISA.5.26	He will lift up a flag to [call] the distant nations [to bring His judgment on Judah],
ISA.5.26	And will whistle for them from the ends of the earth;
ISA.5.26	And indeed, they will come with great speed swiftly.
ISA.5.27	No one among them is weary or stumbles,
ISA.5.27	No one slumbers or sleeps;
ISA.5.27	Nor is the belt at their waist undone [as if unprepared for action],
ISA.5.27	Nor is the strap of their sandal broken.
ISA.5.28	Their arrows are sharp and all their bows are strung 
ISA.5.28	Their horses’ hoofs seem like flint and their 
ISA.5.29	Their roaring is like a lioness, they roar like young lions;
ISA.5.29	They growl and seize their prey
ISA.5.29	And carry it off and there is no one to save it.
ISA.5.30	And in that day they will roar against them (Judah) like the roaring of the sea.
ISA.5.30	And if one looks to the land, in fact, there is darkness and distress;
ISA.5.30	Even the light will be darkened by its clouds.
ISA.6.1	In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw [in a vision] the Lord sitting on a throne, high and exalted, with the train of His royal robe filling the [most holy part of the] temple. 
ISA.6.2	Above Him seraphim (heavenly beings) stood; each one had six wings: with two 
ISA.6.3	And one called out to another, saying,
ISA.6.3	“Holy, Holy, Holy is the L
ISA.6.3	The whole earth is filled with His glory.”
ISA.6.4	And the foundations of the thresholds trembled at the voice of him who called out, and the temple was filling with smoke. 
ISA.6.5	Then I said,
ISA.6.5	“Woe is me! For I am ruined,
ISA.6.5	Because I am a man of [ceremonially] unclean lips,
ISA.6.5	And I live among a people of unclean lips;
ISA.6.5	For my eyes have seen the King, the L
ISA.6.6	Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a burning coal in his hand, which he had taken from the altar with tongs. 
ISA.6.7	He touched my mouth 
ISA.6.8	Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us?” Then I said, “Here am I. Send me!” 
ISA.6.9	And He said, “Go, and tell this people:
ISA.6.9	‘Keep on listening, but do not understand;
ISA.6.9	Keep on looking, but do not comprehend.’
ISA.6.10	Make the heart of this people insensitive,
ISA.6.10	Their ears dull,
ISA.6.10	And their eyes dim,
ISA.6.10	Otherwise they might see with their eyes,
ISA.6.10	Hear with their ears,
ISA.6.10	Understand with their hearts,
ISA.6.10	And return and be healed.”
ISA.6.11	Then I said, “Lord, how long?” And He answered,
ISA.6.11	“Until cities are devastated and without inhabitant,
ISA.6.11	And houses are without people
ISA.6.11	And the land is utterly desolate,
ISA.6.12	The L
ISA.6.12	And there are many deserted places in the midst of the land.
ISA.6.13	And though a tenth [of the people] remain in the land,
ISA.6.13	It will again be 
ISA.6.13	Like a massive terebinth tree or like an oak
ISA.6.13	Whose stump remains when it is chopped down.
ISA.6.13	The holy seed [the elect remnant] is its stump [the substance of Israel].”
ISA.7.1	Now it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin king of 
ISA.7.2	When the house of David (Judah) was told, “Aram is allied with Ephraim (Israel),” the hearts of Ahaz and his people trembled as the trees of the forest tremble in the wind.
ISA.7.3	Then the L
ISA.7.4	and say to him, ‘Take care and be calm, do not fear and be weak-hearted because of these two stumps of smoldering logs, on account of the fierce anger of [King] Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah (Pekah, usurper of the throne of Israel). 
ISA.7.5	Because Aram, 
ISA.7.6	“Let us go up against Judah and terrorize it; and let us breach its wall 
ISA.7.7	for this is what the Lord G
ISA.7.8	For the head (capital) of Aram is Damascus and the head of Damascus is [King] Rezin (now within sixty-five years Ephraim will be broken to pieces and will no longer be a people). 
ISA.7.9	And the head (capital) of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son [King Pekah]. If you will not 
ISA.7.10	Then the L
ISA.7.11	“Ask a sign for yourself from the L
ISA.7.12	But Ahaz said, “
ISA.7.13	Then Isaiah said, “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too small a thing for you to try the patience of men, but will you try the patience of my God as well? 
ISA.7.14	Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Listen carefully, the 
ISA.7.15	He will eat curds and honey when he knows 
ISA.7.16	For before the child will know 
ISA.7.17	The L
ISA.7.18	In that day the L
ISA.7.19	These [armies, like flies and bees] will all come and settle on the steep 
ISA.7.20	In that day [when foreign armies swarm the land] the Lord will shave with a razor, hired from the regions beyond the Euphrates (
ISA.7.21	Now in that day [because of the poverty caused by the invaders] a man will keep alive only a young milk cow and two sheep; 
ISA.7.22	and because of the abundance of milk produced he will eat curds, for everyone that is left in the land will eat [only] curds and [wild] honey.
ISA.7.23	And it will come to pass in that day, in every place where there used to be a thousand vines, 
ISA.7.24	People will come there [to hunt] with arrows and with bows because all the land will be briars and thorns. 
ISA.7.25	As for all the hills which used to be cultivated with the pick 
ISA.8.1	Then the L
ISA.8.2	And I will get faithful witnesses to attest [to this prophecy] for me, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.” 
ISA.8.3	So I approached [my wife] the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. Then the L
ISA.8.4	for before the boy knows how to say, ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the riches of Damascus (Aram’s capital) and the spoil of Samaria (Israel’s capital) 
ISA.8.5	Again the L
ISA.8.6	“Because these people (Judah) have refused the gently flowing waters of 
ISA.8.6	And rejoice in Rezin [the king of Aram] and Remaliah’s son [Pekah the king of Israel],
ISA.8.7	Now therefore, listen carefully, the Lord is about to bring on them the waters of the [Euphrates] River, strong and abundant—
ISA.8.7	The king of Assyria and all his glory;
ISA.8.7	And it will rise over all its channels 
ISA.8.8	Then it will

ISA.8.8	And its outstretched wings (the armies of Assyria) will fill the width of Your land, O Immanuel.

ISA.8.9	Listen, all you [our enemies from the] far countries.
ISA.8.9	Prepare yourselves [for war], and be shattered;
ISA.8.9	Prepare yourselves [for war], and be shattered.
ISA.8.10	Take counsel together [against Judah], but it will come to nothing;
ISA.8.10	Speak the word, but it will not stand,
ISA.8.10	For God is with us (Immanuel).”
ISA.8.11	For in this way the L
ISA.8.12	“You are not to say, ‘It is a conspiracy!’
ISA.8.12	In regard to all that this people call a conspiracy,

ISA.8.13	He shall be your [source of] fear,
ISA.8.13	He shall be your [source of] dread [not man].
ISA.8.14	Then He shall be a sanctuary [a sacred, indestructible shelter for those who fear and trust Him];
ISA.8.14	But to both the houses of Israel [both the northern and southern kingdoms—Israel and Judah, He will be] a stone on which to stumble and a rock on which to trip,
ISA.8.14	A trap and a snare for the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
ISA.8.15	Many [among them] will stumble over them;
ISA.8.15	Then they will fall and be broken,
ISA.8.15	They will even be snared and trapped.”
ISA.8.16	Bind up the testimony, seal the law 
ISA.8.17	And I will wait for the L
ISA.8.18	Listen carefully, I and the children whom the L
ISA.8.19	When the people [instead of trusting God] say to you, “Consult the mediums [who try to talk to the dead] and the soothsayers who chirp 
ISA.8.20	[Direct those people] to the law and to the testimony! If their teachings are not in accord with this word, it is because they have no dawn. 
ISA.8.21	They [who consult mediums and soothsayers] will pass through the land deeply distressed and hungry, and when they are hungry, they will become enraged and will curse their king and their God as they look upward. 
ISA.8.22	Then they will look to the earth, they will see only distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish; and 
ISA.9.1	But there will be no 
ISA.9.2	The people who walk in [spiritual] darkness
ISA.9.2	Those who live in the dark land,
ISA.9.2	The Light will shine on them.
ISA.9.3	You [O God] will increase the nation,
ISA.9.3	You will multiply their joy;
ISA.9.3	They will rejoice before You
ISA.9.3	Like the joy 
ISA.9.3	As men rejoice when they divide the spoil [of victory].
ISA.9.4	For You will break the yoke of Israel’s burden and the staff (goad) on their shoulders,
ISA.9.4	The rod of their oppressor, as at the 
ISA.9.5	For every boot of the marching warrior in the 
ISA.9.5	And [every soldier’s] garment rolled in blood, will be 
ISA.9.6	For to us a Child shall be born, to us a Son shall be given;
ISA.9.6	And the government shall be upon His shoulder,
ISA.9.6	And His name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
ISA.9.6	Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
ISA.9.7	There shall be no end to the increase of His government and of peace,
ISA.9.7	[He shall rule] on the throne of David and over his kingdom,
ISA.9.7	To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness
ISA.9.7	From that time forward and forevermore.
ISA.9.7	The zeal of the L
ISA.9.8	The Lord sends a word (message) against Jacob,
ISA.9.8	And it falls on Israel [the ten northern tribes, the kingdom of Ephraim].
ISA.9.9	And all the people know it,
ISA.9.9	Who say in pride and arrogance of heart:
ISA.9.10	“The bricks have fallen down,
ISA.9.10	But we will rebuild [all the better] with ashlar (hewed stones);
ISA.9.10	The sycamores have been cut down,
ISA.9.10	But we will replace them with [expensive] cedars.”
ISA.9.11	Therefore the L
ISA.9.11	And spurs their enemies on,
ISA.9.12	The Arameans on the east and the Philistines on the west;
ISA.9.12	And they devour Israel with gaping jaws.
ISA.9.12	In 
ISA.9.12	But His hand is still stretched out [in judgment].
ISA.9.13	Yet the people do not turn back [in repentance] to Him who struck them,
ISA.9.13	Nor do they seek the L
ISA.9.14	Therefore the L
ISA.9.15	The elderly and honorable man, he is the head;
ISA.9.15	And the prophet who teaches lies, he is the tail.
ISA.9.16	For those who lead this people are causing 
ISA.9.16	And those who are led [astray] by them are swallowed up.
ISA.9.17	Therefore the Lord does not rejoice over their young men,
ISA.9.17	Nor does He have compassion on their fatherless or their widows;
ISA.9.17	For every one of them is godless and an evildoer,
ISA.9.17	And every mouth is speaking foolishness.
ISA.9.17	In 
ISA.9.17	But His hand is still stretched out [in judgment].
ISA.9.18	For wickedness burns like a fire;
ISA.9.18	It consumes briars and thorns,
ISA.9.18	It even sets the forest thickets ablaze;
ISA.9.18	And it swirls upward in a column of smoke.
ISA.9.19	By the wrath of the L
ISA.9.19	And the people are like fuel for the fire;
ISA.9.19	No man spares his brother.
ISA.9.20	They slice off [in discord] 
ISA.9.20	And they eat 
ISA.9.20	Each eats the flesh of his own arm.
ISA.9.21	[The tribe of] Manasseh 
ISA.9.21	And together they are against Judah (the southern kingdom, the house of David).
ISA.9.21	In 
ISA.9.21	But His hand is still stretched out [in judgment].
ISA.10.1	Woe (judgment is coming) to those [judges] who issue evil statutes,
ISA.10.1	And to those [magistrates] who constantly record unjust 
ISA.10.2	So as to deprive the needy of justice
ISA.10.2	And rob the poor of My people of rightful claims,
ISA.10.2	So that widows may be their spoil
ISA.10.2	And that they may plunder the fatherless.
ISA.10.3	Now what will you do in the day of [God’s] punishment,
ISA.10.3	And in the storm of devastation which will come from far away?
ISA.10.3	To whom will you flee for help?
ISA.10.3	And where will you leave your wealth [for safekeeping]?
ISA.10.4	Nothing 
ISA.10.4	Or fall [dead] among the slain [on the battlefield].
ISA.10.4	In 
ISA.10.4	But His hand is still stretched out [in judgment].
ISA.10.5	Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger [against Israel],
ISA.10.5	The staff in whose hand is My indignation 
ISA.10.6	I send Assyria against a godless nation
ISA.10.6	And commission it against the people of My wrath
ISA.10.6	To take the spoil and to seize the plunder,
ISA.10.6	And to trample them down like mud in the streets.
ISA.10.7	Yet it is not Assyria’s intention [to do My will],
ISA.10.7	Nor does it plan so in its heart,
ISA.10.7	But instead it is its purpose to destroy
ISA.10.7	And to cut off many nations.
ISA.10.8	For Assyria says, “Are not my princes all kings?
ISA.10.9	Is not Calno [conquered] like Carchemish [on the Euphrates]?
ISA.10.9	Is not Hamath [subdued] like Arpad [her neighbor]?
ISA.10.9	Is not Samaria [in Israel] like Damascus [in Aram]?
ISA.10.10	As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols,
ISA.10.10	Whose carved images were greater 
ISA.10.11	Shall I not do to Jerusalem and her images
ISA.10.11	Just as I have done to Samaria and her idols?” [declares Assyria].
ISA.10.12	So when the Lord has completed all His work [of judgment] on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, 
ISA.10.13	For the Assyrian king has said,
ISA.10.13	“I have done this by the power of my [own] hand and by my wisdom,
ISA.10.13	For I have understanding 
ISA.10.13	I have removed the boundaries of the peoples
ISA.10.13	And have plundered their treasures;
ISA.10.13	Like a bull I have brought down those who sat on thrones.
ISA.10.14	My hand has found the wealth of the people like a nest,
ISA.10.14	And as one gathers eggs that are abandoned, so I have gathered all the earth;
ISA.10.14	And there was not one that flapped its wing, or that opened its beak and chirped.”
ISA.10.15	Is the axe able to lift itself over the one who chops with it?
ISA.10.15	Is the saw able to magnify itself over the one who wields it?
ISA.10.15	Or like a staff raising 
ISA.10.16	Therefore the Lord, the G
ISA.10.16	And under his glory a fire will be kindled like a burning flame.
ISA.10.17	And the Light of Israel will become a fire and His Holy One a flame,
ISA.10.17	And it will 
ISA.10.18	The Lord will consume the glory of Assyria’s forest and of its fruitful garden, both soul and body,
ISA.10.18	And it will be as when a sick man wastes away.
ISA.10.19	And the remaining trees of Assyria’s forest will be so few in number
ISA.10.19	That a child could write them down.
ISA.10.20	Now in that day the remnant of Israel, and those of the house of Jacob who have escaped, will never again rely on the one who struck them, but will truly rely on the L
ISA.10.21	A 
ISA.10.22	For though your people, O Israel, may be as the sand of the sea,
ISA.10.22	The destruction is determined [it is decided and destined for completion], overflowing with justice (righteous punishment).
ISA.10.23	For the Lord, the G
ISA.10.24	Therefore, the Lord G
ISA.10.25	For yet a very little while and My indignation [against you] will be fulfilled and My anger 
ISA.10.26	The L
ISA.10.27	So it will be in that day, that the burden of the Assyrian will be removed from your shoulders and his yoke from your neck. The yoke will be broken because of the fat.
ISA.10.28	The Assyrian has come against Aiath [in Judah],
ISA.10.28	He has passed through Migron [with his army];
ISA.10.28	At Michmash he stored his equipment.
ISA.10.29	They have gone through the pass, 
ISA.10.29	“Geba will be our lodging place for the night.”
ISA.10.29	Ramah trembles, and Gibeah [the city] of Saul has fled.
ISA.10.30	Cry aloud with your voice [in consternation], O Daughter of Gallim!
ISA.10.30	Pay attention, Laishah! Answer her, Anathoth!
ISA.10.31	Madmenah has fled;
ISA.10.31	The inhabitants of Gebim have fled [with their belongings] to safety.
ISA.10.32	Yet today the Assyrian will halt at Nob [the city of priests];
ISA.10.32	He shakes his fist at the mountain of the Daughter of Zion, at the hill of Jerusalem.
ISA.10.33	Listen carefully, the Lord, the G
ISA.10.33	The tall in stature will be cut down
ISA.10.33	And the lofty will be abased 
ISA.10.34	He will cut down the thickets of the forest with an iron 
ISA.10.34	And Lebanon (the Assyrian) will fall by the Mighty One.
ISA.11.1	Then a Shoot (the Messiah) will spring from the stock of Jesse [David’s father],
ISA.11.1	And a Branch from his roots will bear fruit.
ISA.11.2	And the Spirit of the L
ISA.11.2	The Spirit of wisdom and understanding,
ISA.11.2	The Spirit of counsel and strength,
ISA.11.2	The Spirit of knowledge and of the [reverential and obedient] fear of the L
ISA.11.3	And He will delight in the fear of the L
ISA.11.3	And He will not judge by what His eyes see,
ISA.11.3	Nor make decisions by what His ears hear;
ISA.11.4	But with righteousness 
ISA.11.4	And decide with fairness for the downtrodden of the earth;
ISA.11.4	And He shall strike the earth with the rod of His mouth,
ISA.11.4	And with the breath of His lips He shall slay the wicked.
ISA.11.5	And righteousness will be the belt around His loins,
ISA.11.5	And faithfulness the belt around His waist.
ISA.11.6	And the wolf will dwell with the lamb,
ISA.11.6	And the leopard will lie down with the young goat,
ISA.11.6	And the calf and the young lion and the fatted steer together;
ISA.11.6	And a little child will lead them.
ISA.11.7	And the cow and the bear will graze [together],
ISA.11.7	Their young will lie down together,
ISA.11.7	And the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
ISA.11.8	And the nursing child will [safely] play over the hole of the cobra,
ISA.11.8	And the weaned child will put his hand on the viper’s den [and not be hurt].
ISA.11.9	They will not hurt or destroy in all My holy mountain,
ISA.11.9	For the earth will be full of the knowledge of the L
ISA.11.9	As the waters cover the sea.
ISA.11.10	Then in that day
ISA.11.10	The nations will make supplications to the Root of Jesse
ISA.11.10	Who will stand as a signal for the peoples;
ISA.11.10	And His resting place will be glorious.
ISA.11.11	Then it will happen on that day that the Lord
ISA.11.11	Will again acquire with His hand a second time
ISA.11.11	The remnant of His people, who will remain,
ISA.11.11	From Assyria, from [Lower] Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush (Ethiopia), from Elam [in Persia], from Shinar [Babylonia], from Hamath [in Aram],
ISA.11.11	And from the coastlands 
ISA.11.12	And He will lift up a signal for the nations
ISA.11.12	And assemble the 
ISA.11.12	And will gather the dispersed of Judah
ISA.11.12	From the four corners of the earth.
ISA.11.13	Then the jealousy of 
ISA.11.13	And those who harass 
ISA.11.13	Ephraim will not be jealous of Judah,
ISA.11.13	And Judah will not harass Ephraim.
ISA.11.14	Ephraim and Judah will [unite and] swoop down on the slopes of the Philistines toward the west;
ISA.11.14	Together they will plunder the sons (Arabs) of the east.
ISA.11.14	They will possess Edom and Moab,
ISA.11.14	And the sons of Ammon will be subject to them.
ISA.11.15	And the L
ISA.11.15	The tongue of the 
ISA.11.15	And with His scorching wind
ISA.11.15	He will wave His hand over the River;
ISA.11.15	He will strike 
ISA.11.15	And make [it possible for] people [to] walk over in sandals.
ISA.11.16	And there will be a highway from Assyria
ISA.11.16	For the remnant of His people who will be left,
ISA.11.16	Just as there was for Israel
ISA.11.16	In the day when they came up out of the land of Egypt.
ISA.12.1	And on that day you will say,
ISA.12.1	“I will give thanks to You, O L
ISA.12.1	For though You were angry with me,
ISA.12.1	Your anger has turned away,
ISA.12.1	And You comfort me.
ISA.12.2	Behold, God, my salvation!
ISA.12.2	I will trust and not be afraid,
ISA.12.2	For the L
ISA.12.2	Yes, He has become my salvation.”
ISA.12.3	Therefore with joy you will draw water
ISA.12.3	From the springs of salvation.
ISA.12.4	And in that day you will say,
ISA.12.4	“Give thanks to the L
ISA.12.4	Make His deeds known among the peoples [of the earth];
ISA.12.4	Proclaim [to them] that His name is exalted!”
ISA.12.5	Sing praises to the L
ISA.12.5	Let this be known throughout the earth.
ISA.12.6	Rejoice and shout for joy, O inhabitant of Zion,
ISA.12.6	For great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.13.1	The [mournful, inspired] oracle (
ISA.13.2	Lift up a signal banner on the bare mountain,
ISA.13.2	Summon them [the Medes and Persians] with a loud voice,
ISA.13.2	Wave the [beckoning] hand so that they may enter the doorways of the [Babylonian] nobles.
ISA.13.3	I [the L
ISA.13.3	I have even called My great warriors,
ISA.13.3	My proudly exulting ones [the Medes and the Persians who triumph for My honor]—
ISA.13.3	To 
ISA.13.4	A sound of tumult on the mountains,
ISA.13.4	Like that of many people!
ISA.13.4	A sound of the uproar of the kingdoms,
ISA.13.4	Of nations gathered together!
ISA.13.4	The L
ISA.13.5	They are coming from a distant country,
ISA.13.5	From the end of heaven [the farthest horizon]—
ISA.13.5	The L
ISA.13.5	To destroy the whole land.
ISA.13.6	Wail, for the day of the L
ISA.13.6	It will come as 
ISA.13.7	Therefore 
ISA.13.7	And every man’s heart will melt.
ISA.13.8	They [of Babylon] will be shocked 
ISA.13.8	Pains and anguish will grip them;
ISA.13.8	They will be in pain like a woman in childbirth.
ISA.13.8	They will stare aghast 
ISA.13.8	Their faces aflame [from the effects of the unprecedented warfare].
ISA.13.9	Listen carefully, the day of the L
ISA.13.9	Cruel, with wrath and raging anger,
ISA.13.9	To make the land a horror [of devastation];
ISA.13.9	And He shall exterminate its sinners from it.
ISA.13.10	For the stars of heaven and their constellations
ISA.13.10	Will not flash with their light;
ISA.13.10	The sun will be dark when it rises,
ISA.13.10	And the moon will not shed its light.
ISA.13.11	In this way I will punish the world for its evil
ISA.13.11	And the wicked for their wickedness [their sin, their injustice, their wrongdoing];
ISA.13.11	I will also put an end to the arrogance of the proud
ISA.13.11	And will abase the arrogance of the tyrant.
ISA.13.12	I will make mortal man more rare than fine gold,
ISA.13.12	And mankind [scarcer] than the pure gold of Ophir.
ISA.13.13	Therefore I will make the heavens tremble;
ISA.13.13	And the earth will be shaken from its place
ISA.13.13	At the wrath of the L
ISA.13.13	In the day of His burning anger.
ISA.13.14	And like the hunted gazelle,
ISA.13.14	Or like sheep that no man gathers,
ISA.13.14	Each [foreign resident] will turn [and go back] to his own people,
ISA.13.14	And each one flee to his own land.
ISA.13.15	Anyone who is found will be pierced through,
ISA.13.15	And anyone who is captured will fall by the sword.
ISA.13.16	Their children also will be smashed to pieces
ISA.13.16	Before their eyes;
ISA.13.16	Their houses will be looted
ISA.13.16	And their wives ravished.
ISA.13.17	Listen carefully, I will put the Medes [in motion] against them,
ISA.13.17	Who have no regard for silver and do not delight in gold [and therefore cannot be bribed].
ISA.13.18	Their bows will cut down the young men [of Babylon];
ISA.13.18	They will take no pity on the fruit of the womb,
ISA.13.18	Their eyes will not look with compassion on the children.
ISA.13.19	And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the 
ISA.13.19	Will be like Sodom and Gomorrah when God overthrew them.
ISA.13.20	Babylon will never be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation;
ISA.13.20	Nor will the Arab pitch his tent there,
ISA.13.20	Nor will the shepherds let

ISA.13.21	And their houses will be full of owls;
ISA.13.21	Ostriches also will live there, and 
ISA.13.22	And jackals in their luxurious palaces.
ISA.13.22	Babylon’s time has nearly come,
ISA.13.22	And her days will not be prolonged.
ISA.14.1	For the L

ISA.14.10	You have become like us.

ISA.14.11	Along with the music of your harps;
ISA.14.11	The maggots [which prey on the dead] are spread out under you [as a bed]
ISA.14.11	And worms are your covering [Babylonian rulers].’
ISA.14.12	How you have fallen from heaven,
ISA.14.12	O 
ISA.14.12	You have been cut down to the ground,
ISA.14.12	You who have weakened the nations [king of Babylon]!
ISA.14.13	But you said in your heart,
ISA.14.13	‘I will ascend to heaven;
ISA.14.13	I will raise my throne above the stars of God;
ISA.14.13	I will sit on the mount of assembly
ISA.14.13	In the remote parts of the north.
ISA.14.14	I will ascend above the heights of the clouds;
ISA.14.14	I will make myself like the Most High.’
ISA.14.15	But [in fact] you will be brought down to Sheol,
ISA.14.15	To the remote recesses of the pit (the region of the dead).
ISA.14.16	Those who see you will gaze at you,
ISA.14.16	They will consider you, 
ISA.14.16	‘Is this the man who made the earth tremble,
ISA.14.16	Who shook kingdoms,

ISA.14.18	All the kings of the nations, all of them lie [dead] in glorious array,
ISA.14.18	Each one in his own sepulcher.
ISA.14.19	But you [king of Babylon] have been cast out of your tomb (denied burial)
ISA.14.19	Like a rejected branch,
ISA.14.19	Clothed with the slain who are pierced by the sword,
ISA.14.19	Who go down to the stones of the pit [into which carcasses are thrown],
ISA.14.19	Like a dead body trampled [underfoot].
ISA.14.20	You will not be united with them in burial,

ISA.14.32	That the L
ISA.14.32	And the afflicted of His people will seek

ISA.15.1	Because in a night Ar of Moab is devastated and ruined;
ISA.15.1	Because in a night Kir of Moab is devastated and ruined.
ISA.15.2	They have gone up to the temple and to Dibon, to the high places to weep.
ISA.15.2	Moab wails over Nebo and over Medeba;
ISA.15.2	Everyone’s head is shaved, and every beard is cut off [in mourning].
ISA.15.3	In their streets they have wrapped themselves with sackcloth;
ISA.15.3	On their [flat] housetops and in their open squares
ISA.15.3	Everyone is wailing, dissolved in tears.
ISA.15.4	Heshbon and Elealeh [cities claimed by Moab] cry out;
ISA.15.4	Their voice is heard as far as Jahaz.
ISA.15.4	Therefore the armed men of Moab cry out;
ISA.15.4	Moab’s soul trembles within him.
ISA.15.5	My heart cries out for Moab;
ISA.15.5	His fugitives are [fleeing] as far as Zoar and Eglath-shelishiyah.
ISA.15.5	For they go up the ascent of Luhith weeping;
ISA.15.5	For on the road to Horonaim they raise a cry of distress over their destruction.
ISA.15.6	For the waters of Nimrim are desolate.
ISA.15.6	Indeed the grass is withered, the new growth dies;
ISA.15.6	There is no green thing.
ISA.15.7	Therefore the abundance

ISA.15.8	For the cry of distress has echoed around the territory of Moab;
ISA.15.8	The wailing 
ISA.15.9	For the waters of Dimon are full of blood;
ISA.15.9	Yet I will bring even more 
ISA.15.9	A lion upon those of Moab who escape and upon the remnant of the land.
ISA.16.1	Send lambs to the ruler of the land [
ISA.16.1	From Sela [that is, Petra in Edom] through the wilderness to the mountain of the Daughter of Zion (Jerusalem).
ISA.16.2	For like wandering birds or scattered nestlings,

ISA.16.3	[Say to the ruler] “Give us advice, make a decision [for Moab, king of Judah];
ISA.16.3	Cast your shadow [over us] like night in the midst of noon;
ISA.16.3	Hide the outcasts, do not betray the fugitive [to his pursuer].
ISA.16.4	Let our outcasts of Moab live among you;
ISA.16.4	Be a [sheltered] hiding place to them from the destroyer.”
ISA.16.4	For the extortioner has come to an end, destruction has ceased,
ISA.16.4	Oppressors [who trample men] have completely 
ISA.16.5	A throne will be established in lovingkindness,
ISA.16.5	And One will sit on it in faithfulness in the tent (dynasty, family) of David;

ISA.16.5	And being prompt to do righteousness.
ISA.16.6	We have heard of the pride of Moab, an excessive pride—
ISA.16.6	Even of his arrogance, his conceit, his rage,
ISA.16.6	His untruthful boasting.
ISA.16.7	Therefore Moab will wail for Moab; everyone will wail.
ISA.16.7	You will mourn for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth,
ISA.16.7	As those who are utterly stricken 
ISA.16.8	For the fields of Heshbon have languished 
ISA.16.8	The lords of the nations have trampled down [Moab’s] choice vine branches,
ISA.16.8	Which reached as far as Jazer and wandered into the wilderness;
ISA.16.8	Its tendrils stretched out, they passed over [the shores of] the [Dead] Sea.
ISA.16.9	Therefore I (Isaiah) will weep bitterly for Jazer, for the vines of Sibmah.
ISA.16.9	I will drench you with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh;
ISA.16.9	For the war-cry [of the enemy] has fallen on your summer fruits and your harvest.
ISA.16.10	Gladness and joy are taken away from the fruitful field;
ISA.16.10	In the vineyards there will be no singing or joyful sound;
ISA.16.10	No treader treads out wine in the presses,
ISA.16.10	For I (God) put an end to the joyful shouting.
ISA.16.11	Therefore my heart sounds like a harp [in mournful compassion] for Moab,
ISA.16.11	And my inner being 
ISA.16.12	So it will come to pass when Moab presents himself,
ISA.16.12	When he wearies himself [worshiping] on his high place [of idolatry]
ISA.16.12	And comes to his sanctuary [of Chemosh, god of Moab] to pray,
ISA.16.12	That he will not prevail.

ISA.17.3	The fortified city will disappear from Ephraim,

ISA.17.3	And the remnant of Aram (Syria);

ISA.17.5	As his arm harvests the ears of grain;
ISA.17.5	Yes, it will be like one gleaning ears of grain
ISA.17.5	In the [fertile] Valley of Rephaim.
ISA.17.6	Yet gleanings will be left in the land [of Israel] like the shaking of the olive tree,
ISA.17.6	Two or three olives on the topmost branch,
ISA.17.6	Four or five on the [outermost] branches of the fruitful tree,”
ISA.17.6	Declares the L
ISA.17.7	In that day man will have regard for his Maker,

ISA.17.8	And he will not have regard for the [idolatrous] altars, the work of his hands,
ISA.17.8	Nor will he look to that which his fingers have made,
ISA.17.8	Neither the Asherim (symbols of the goddess Asherah) nor the incense altars.
ISA.17.9	In that day the strong cities of Aram and Israel will be like 
ISA.17.9	Or like branches which they abandoned before the children of Israel;
ISA.17.9	And the land will be a desolation.
ISA.17.10	Because you [Judah] have forgotten the God of your salvation
ISA.17.10	And have not remembered the Rock of your Stronghold—
ISA.17.10	Therefore you plant 
ISA.17.10	And set the grounds with vine slips of a strange

ISA.17.11	In the day of sickness and incurable pain.
ISA.17.12	Oh, the uproar of many peoples

ISA.19.7	The meadows by the Nile, by the edge of the Nile,

ISA.19.8	The fishermen will lament (cry out in grief),

ISA.19.9	Moreover, those who make linen from combed flax
ISA.19.9	And those who weave white cloth will be ashamed.
ISA.19.10	[Those who are] the pillars

ISA.19.11	How can you say to Pharaoh,
ISA.19.11	“I am a son of the wise, a son of ancient kings?”
ISA.19.12	Where then are your wise men?
ISA.19.12	Please let them tell you,
ISA.19.12	And let them understand what the L

ISA.19.13	The princes of Zoan have acted like fools,

ISA.19.15	There will be no work for Egypt
ISA.19.15	Which head or tail, [high] palm branch or [low] bulrush, may do.

ISA.22.7	And it came to pass that your choicest valleys were full of chariots,
ISA.22.7	And the horsemen took their fixed positions [in an offensive array] at the gate [of Jerusalem].
ISA.22.8	Then God removed the [protective] covering of Judah;

ISA.22.9	You saw that the breaches
ISA.22.9	In the wall of the City of David [the citadel of Zion] were many;
ISA.22.9	You collected [within the city’s walls] the waters of the Lower Pool (Siloam).
ISA.22.10	Then you counted the houses of Jerusalem
ISA.22.10	And you tore down the houses [to get materials] to fortify the city wall [by extending it].

ISA.23.15	Now in that day Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, like the days of one king. At the end of seventy years it will happen to Tyre as in the prostitute’s song:
ISA.23.16	Take a harp, walk around the city,
ISA.23.16	O forgotten prostitute;
ISA.23.16	Play the strings skillfully, sing many songs,
ISA.23.16	That you may be remembered.

ISA.24.6	Therefore, a curse devours the earth, and those who live on it suffer the punishment of their guilt. Therefore, the inhabitants of the earth are burned [under the curse of God’s wrath], and few people are left.
ISA.24.7	The new wine mourns,
ISA.24.7	The vine decays;

ISA.24.11	There is an outcry in the streets concerning the wine;

ISA.24.11	The joy of the earth is banished.
ISA.24.12	Horrible desolation is left in the city,
ISA.24.12	And the gate is battered into ruins.
ISA.24.13	For so it will be in the midst of the earth among the peoples,
ISA.24.13	As the shaking of an olive tree,
ISA.24.13	As the gleanings when the grape harvest is over [and only a little of the fruit remains].

ISA.26.19	For your dew is a dew of [celestial] light [heavenly, supernatural],

ISA.27.11	And He who created them will not be gracious to them.
ISA.27.12	In that day the L
ISA.27.13	It will come to pass in that day that a great trumpet will be blown, and those who were lost 
ISA.28.1	Woe (judgment is coming) to [Samaria] the splendid crown of the drunkards of 
ISA.28.1	And to the fading flower of its glorious beauty,
ISA.28.1	Which is at the head of the rich valley
ISA.28.1	Of those who are overcome with wine!
ISA.28.2	Listen carefully, the Lord has a strong and mighty 
ISA.28.2	Like a tempest of hail, a disastrous storm,
ISA.28.2	Like a tempest of mighty overflowing waters,
ISA.28.2	He has cast it down to the earth with 
ISA.28.3	The splendid crown of the drunkards of Ephraim is trampled by [the foreigners’] feet.
ISA.28.4	And the fading flower of its glorious beauty,
ISA.28.4	Which is at the head of the rich valley,
ISA.28.4	Will be like the early fig before the summer,
ISA.28.4	Which one sees,
ISA.28.4	And as soon as it is in his hand
ISA.28.4	He [greedily] swallows it [and so will the Assyrians rapidly devour Samaria, Israel’s capital].
ISA.28.5	In that day the L
ISA.28.5	And a glorious diadem to the [converted] remnant of His people,
ISA.28.6	A spirit of justice for him who sits in judgment [administering the law],
ISA.28.6	A strength to those who drive back the battle at the gate.
ISA.28.7	But even these reel with wine and stagger from strong drink:
ISA.28.7	The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink;
ISA.28.7	They are confused by wine, they stagger from strong drink;
ISA.28.7	They reel while seeing visions,
ISA.28.7	They stagger 
ISA.28.8	For all the tables are full of filthy vomit, so that there is no place [that is clean.]
ISA.28.9	And to whom would He explain the message?
ISA.28.9	Those 
ISA.28.9	Those 
ISA.28.10	For 
ISA.28.10	‘Precept upon precept, precept upon precept,
ISA.28.10	Rule upon rule, rule upon rule,
ISA.28.10	Here a little, there a little.’ ”
ISA.28.11	Indeed, the L
ISA.28.11	By [men with] stammering lips and a foreign tongue,
ISA.28.12	He who said to them, “This is the place of quiet, give rest to the weary,”
ISA.28.12	And, “This is the resting place,” yet they would not listen.
ISA.28.13	Therefore the word of the L
ISA.28.13	“Precept upon precept, precept upon precept,
ISA.28.13	Rule upon rule, rule upon rule,
ISA.28.13	Here a little, there a little.”
ISA.28.13	That they may go and stumble backward, and be broken, ensnared, and taken captive.
ISA.28.14	Therefore, hear the word of the L
ISA.28.14	Who rule this people who are in Jerusalem!
ISA.28.15	Because you have said, “We have made a covenant with death,
ISA.28.15	And with Sheol (the place of the dead) we have made an agreement,
ISA.28.15	When the overwhelming scourge passes by, it will not reach us,
ISA.28.15	For we have made lies our refuge and we have concealed ourselves in deception.”
ISA.28.16	Therefore the Lord G
ISA.28.16	“Listen carefully, I am laying in Zion a Stone, a tested Stone,
ISA.28.16	A precious Cornerstone for the [secure] foundation, firmly placed.
ISA.28.16	He who believes [who trusts in, relies on, and adheres to that Stone] will not 
ISA.28.17	I will make justice the measuring line
ISA.28.17	And righteousness the mason’s level;
ISA.28.17	Then hail will sweep away the refuge of lies
ISA.28.17	And waters will flood over the secret [hiding] place.
ISA.28.18	Your covenant with death will be annulled,
ISA.28.18	And your agreement with Sheol (the place of the dead) will not stand;
ISA.28.18	When the overwhelming scourge passes through,
ISA.28.18	Then you will become its trampling ground.
ISA.28.19	As often as it passes through, it will seize you;
ISA.28.19	For morning after morning it will pass through, by day and by night,
ISA.28.19	And it will be sheer terror to understand what it means.”
ISA.28.20	For the bed is too short to stretch out on,
ISA.28.20	And the blanket is too narrow to wrap around oneself [and likewise all their preparations are inadequate].
ISA.28.21	For the L
ISA.28.21	He will be stirred up as in the Valley of Gibeon,
ISA.28.21	To do His work, His unusual 
ISA.28.21	And to accomplish His work, His extraordinary work.
ISA.28.22	Now do not carry on as scoffers,
ISA.28.22	Or the bands which bind you will be made stronger;
ISA.28.22	For I have heard from the Lord G
ISA.28.22	Of decisive destruction on all the earth.
ISA.28.23	Listen and hear my voice;
ISA.28.23	Listen carefully and hear my words.
ISA.28.24	Does the farmer plow all day to plant seed?
ISA.28.24	Does he 
ISA.28.25	When he has leveled its surface,
ISA.28.25	Does he not sow [the seed of] dill and scatter cumin,
ISA.28.25	And plant wheat in rows,
ISA.28.25	And barley in its [intended] place and 
ISA.28.26	For his God instructs [him correctly] and teaches him properly.
ISA.28.27	For dill is not threshed with a sharp threshing sledge,
ISA.28.27	Nor is a cartwheel rolled over cumin;
ISA.28.27	But dill is beaten out with a staff, and cumin with a rod.
ISA.28.28	Bread 
ISA.28.28	Indeed, the farmer does not continue to thresh it forever.
ISA.28.28	Because the wheel of his cart and his horses 
ISA.28.28	He does not thresh it longer.
ISA.28.29	This also comes from the L
ISA.28.29	Who has made His counsel wonderful and His wisdom great.
ISA.29.1	Woe (judgment is coming) to 
ISA.29.1	Add 
ISA.29.2	Then I will harass Ariel,
ISA.29.2	And she will be a 
ISA.29.2	Yet she will be like an 
ISA.29.3	I will camp against you and encircle you,
ISA.29.3	And I will hem you in with siege works,
ISA.29.3	And I will raise fortifications against you.
ISA.29.4	Then you [Jerusalem] will be brought low,
ISA.29.4	You will speak from the earth,
ISA.29.4	And from the dust where you lie face down
ISA.29.4	Your muffled words 
ISA.29.4	Your voice will also be like that of a spirit from the earth [like one produced by a medium],
ISA.29.4	And your speech will whisper 
ISA.29.5	But the multitude of your enemies [that assault you] will become like fine dust,
ISA.29.5	And the multitude of the tyrants like the chaff which 
ISA.29.5	And it will happen in an instant, suddenly [that your enemy is destroyed].
ISA.29.6	You will be punished by the L
ISA.29.6	With whirlwind and tempest and the flame of a consuming fire.
ISA.29.7	And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel (Jerusalem),
ISA.29.7	Even all who fight against her and her stronghold, and who distress her,
ISA.29.7	Will be like a dream, a vision of the night.
ISA.29.8	It will be as when a hungry man dreams
ISA.29.8	That he is eating,
ISA.29.8	But when he awakens, his 
ISA.29.8	Or as when a thirsty man dreams
ISA.29.8	That he is drinking,
ISA.29.8	But when he awakens, in fact, he is faint
ISA.29.8	And his thirst is not quenched.
ISA.29.8	So will the multitude of all the nations be
ISA.29.8	Who fight against Mount Zion.
ISA.29.9	Stop 
ISA.29.9	Blind yourselves and be blinded [at its fulfillment by your spiritual incompetence].
ISA.29.9	They are drunk, but not from wine;
ISA.29.9	They stagger, but not from strong drink.
ISA.29.10	For the L
ISA.29.10	He has closed your eyes, [you who are] the prophets;
ISA.29.10	And He has covered your heads, [you who are] the seers.
ISA.29.11	The entire vision [of all these things] will be to you like the words of a scroll that is sealed, which they give to one who can read, saying, “Read this, please,” he shall say, “I cannot, for it is sealed.” 
ISA.29.12	Then the book will be given to the one who cannot read, saying, “Read this, please.” And he will say, “I cannot read.”
ISA.29.13	Then the Lord said,
ISA.29.13	“Because this nation approaches [Me only] with their words
ISA.29.13	And honors Me [only] with their lip service,
ISA.29.13	But they remove their hearts far from Me,
ISA.29.13	And their reverence for Me is a tradition that is learned 
ISA.29.14	Therefore, listen carefully, I will again do marvelous 
ISA.29.14	And the wisdom of their wise men will perish,
ISA.29.14	And the understanding of their discerning men will be hidden.”
ISA.29.15	Woe (judgment is coming) to those who [try to] deeply hide their plans from the L
ISA.29.15	Whose deeds are 
ISA.29.15	And who say, “Who sees us?” or “Who knows us?”
ISA.29.16	You turn 
ISA.29.16	Shall the potter be considered equal with the clay,
ISA.29.16	That the thing that is made would say to its maker, “He did not make me”;
ISA.29.16	Or the thing that is formed say to him who formed it, “He has no understanding”?
ISA.29.17	Is it not yet a very little while
ISA.29.17	Until Lebanon will be turned into a fertile field,
ISA.29.17	And the fertile field regarded as a forest?
ISA.29.18	On that day the deaf will hear the words of a book,
ISA.29.18	And out of 
ISA.29.19	The afflicted also will increase their joy in the L
ISA.29.19	And the needy of mankind will rejoice 
ISA.29.20	For the tyrant will come to an end and the scorner will be finished,
ISA.29.20	Indeed all who are intent on doing evil will be cut off—
ISA.29.21	Those who cause a person to be condemned with a [false] word,
ISA.29.21	And lay a trap for him who upholds justice at the [city] gate,
ISA.29.21	And defraud the one in the right with meaningless arguments.
ISA.29.22	Therefore, the L
ISA.29.22	“Jacob will not be ashamed, nor will his face turn pale [with disappointment because of his children’s degenerate behavior];
ISA.29.23	For when he sees his children, the work of My hands, in his midst,
ISA.29.23	They will sanctify My Name;
ISA.29.23	They will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob
ISA.29.23	And will stand in awe 
ISA.29.24	Those who err in mind will know the truth,
ISA.29.24	And those who criticize 
ISA.30.1	“Woe (judgment is coming) to the rebellious children,” declares the L
ISA.30.1	“Who carry out a plan, but not Mine,
ISA.30.1	And make an alliance [by pouring out a libation], but not of My Spirit,
ISA.30.1	In order to add sin to sin;
ISA.30.2	Who proceed down to Egypt
ISA.30.2	Without consulting 
ISA.30.2	To take refuge in the stronghold of Pharaoh
ISA.30.2	And to take shelter in the shadow of Egypt!
ISA.30.3	Therefore the safety 
ISA.30.3	And the refuge in the shadow of Egypt, your humiliation 
ISA.30.4	For his princes are at Zoan
ISA.30.4	And his ambassadors arrive at Hanes [in Egypt].
ISA.30.5	All will be ashamed because of a people (the Egyptians) who cannot benefit them,
ISA.30.5	Who are not a help or benefit, but a shame and also a disgrace.”
ISA.30.6	A [mournful, inspired] oracle (
ISA.30.6	Through a land of trouble and anguish,
ISA.30.6	From 
ISA.30.6	They carry their riches on the shoulders of young donkeys
ISA.30.6	And their treasures on the humps of camels,
ISA.30.6	To a people (Egyptians) who cannot benefit them.
ISA.30.7	For Egypt’s help is worthless and good for nothing.
ISA.30.7	Therefore, I have called her
ISA.30.7	“Rahab Who Has Been Exterminated.”
ISA.30.8	Now, go, write it on a tablet before them
ISA.30.8	And inscribe it on a scroll,
ISA.30.8	So that it may serve in the time to come
ISA.30.8	As a witness [against them] forevermore.
ISA.30.9	For this is a rebellious people, lying sons,
ISA.30.9	Sons who refuse to listen to
ISA.30.9	The law 
ISA.30.10	Who say to the seers, “You must not see 
ISA.30.10	And to the prophets, “You must not prophesy to us what is right!
ISA.30.10	Speak to us pleasant things 
ISA.30.10	Prophesy [deceitful] illusions [that we will enjoy].
ISA.30.11	Get out of the [true] way, turn aside from the path [of God],
ISA.30.11	Stop bothering us with the Holy One of Israel.”
ISA.30.12	Therefore, the Holy One of Israel says this,
ISA.30.12	“Because you have refused 
ISA.30.12	And have put your trust in oppression and guile, and have relied on them,
ISA.30.13	Therefore this wickedness [this sin, this injustice, this wrongdoing] will be to you
ISA.30.13	Like a crack [in a wall] about to fall,
ISA.30.13	A bulge in a high wall,
ISA.30.13	Whose collapse comes suddenly in an instant,
ISA.30.14	Whose collapse is like the smashing of a potter’s jar,
ISA.30.14	Crushed so savagely
ISA.30.14	that there cannot be found among its pieces a potsherd [large enough]
ISA.30.14	To take [coals of] fire from a fireplace,
ISA.30.14	Or to scoop water from a cistern.”
ISA.30.15	For the Lord G
ISA.30.15	“In returning [to Me] and rest you shall be saved,
ISA.30.15	In quietness and confident trust is your strength.”
ISA.30.15	But you were not willing,
ISA.30.16	And you said, “No! We will flee on horses!”
ISA.30.16	Therefore you will flee [from your enemies]!
ISA.30.16	And [you said], “We will ride on swift horses!”
ISA.30.16	Therefore those who pursue you shall be swift.
ISA.30.17	A thousand 
ISA.30.17	You will flee at the threat of five,
ISA.30.17	Until you are left like a flag on the top of a mountain,
ISA.30.17	And like a signal on a hill.
ISA.30.18	Therefore the L
ISA.30.18	And therefore He waits on high to have compassion on you.
ISA.30.18	Blessed (happy, fortunate) are all those who long for Him [since He will never fail them].
ISA.30.20	Though the Lord gives you the bread of adversity and the water of oppression, yet your Teacher will no longer hide Himself, but your eyes will [constantly] see your Teacher. 
ISA.30.21	Your ears will hear a word behind you, “This is the way, walk in it,” whenever you turn to the right or to the left. 
ISA.30.22	And you will defile your carved images overlaid with silver, and your cast images plated with gold. You will scatter them like a bloodstained 
ISA.30.23	Then He will give you rain for the seed with which you sow the ground, and bread [grain] from the produce of the ground, and it will be rich and plentiful. In that day your livestock will graze in large 
ISA.30.24	Also the oxen and the young donkeys that work the ground will eat salted fodder, which has been winnowed with shovel and pitchfork. 
ISA.30.25	On every lofty mountain and on every high hill there will be streams of water on the day of the great slaughter (the day of the L
ISA.30.26	The light of the full moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times 
ISA.30.27	Now look, the 
ISA.30.27	Burning with His anger, and heavy with 
ISA.30.27	His lips are full of 
ISA.30.27	And His tongue is like a consuming fire.
ISA.30.28	His breath is like an overflowing river,
ISA.30.28	Which reaches to the neck,
ISA.30.28	To sift the nations back and forth in a sieve [of disaster],
ISA.30.28	And 
ISA.30.29	You will have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept,
ISA.30.29	And joy of heart as when one marches [in procession] with a flute,
ISA.30.29	To go to the [temple on the] mountain of the L
ISA.30.30	And the L
ISA.30.30	And show the descending of His arm [striking] in [His] fierce anger,
ISA.30.30	And in the flame of a devouring fire,
ISA.30.30	In the crashing sound 
ISA.30.31	For at the voice of the L
ISA.30.32	And every blow of the rod of punishment,
ISA.30.32	Which the L
ISA.30.32	Will be to 
ISA.30.32	And in battles, brandishing weapons, He will fight Assyria.
ISA.30.33	For 
ISA.30.33	Indeed, it has been prepared for the [Assyrian] king.
ISA.30.33	He has made it deep and wide,
ISA.30.33	A pit of fire with plenty of wood;
ISA.30.33	The breath of the L
ISA.31.1	Woe (judgment is coming) to those who go down to Egypt for help,
ISA.31.1	Who rely on horses
ISA.31.1	And trust in chariots because they are many,
ISA.31.1	And in horsemen because they are very strong,
ISA.31.1	But they do not look to the Holy One of Israel, nor seek 
ISA.31.2	Yet He is also wise and will bring disaster,
ISA.31.2	And does not retract His words,
ISA.31.2	But will arise against the house of evildoers
ISA.31.2	And against the helpers of those who do evil.
ISA.31.3	Now the Egyptians are men and not God,
ISA.31.3	And their horses are flesh and not spirit;
ISA.31.3	And the L
ISA.31.3	And he (Egypt) who helps will stumble,
ISA.31.3	And he (Judah) who is helped will fall,
ISA.31.3	And all of them will perish together.
ISA.31.4	For so the L
ISA.31.4	“As the lion or the young lion growls over his prey,
ISA.31.4	And though a large group of shepherds is called out against him
ISA.31.4	He will not be terrified at their voice nor cringe at their noise,
ISA.31.4	So the L
ISA.31.5	Like flying birds, so will the L
ISA.31.5	He will protect and save it,
ISA.31.5	He will pass over and rescue it.
ISA.31.6	Return to Him from whom you have so deeply defected, O sons of Israel. 
ISA.31.7	For in that day every man will reject 
ISA.31.8	Then the Assyrian will fall by a sword not of man,
ISA.31.8	And a sword not of man will devour him.
ISA.31.8	And he will flee from the sword [of God],
ISA.31.8	And his young men will become forced labor.
ISA.31.9	“His rock [his stronghold] will pass away because of panic,
ISA.31.9	And his princes will be terrified at the [sight of the battle] standard,”
ISA.31.9	Declares the L
ISA.32.1	Behold, a 
ISA.32.1	And princes will rule with justice.
ISA.32.2	Each [one of them] will be like a hiding place from the wind
ISA.32.2	And a shelter from the storm,
ISA.32.2	Like streams of water in a dry land,
ISA.32.2	Like the shade of a huge rock in a parched 
ISA.32.3	Then the eyes of those who see will not be blinded,
ISA.32.3	And the ears of those who hear will listen attentively.
ISA.32.4	The heart (mind) of those who act impulsively will discern the truth,
ISA.32.4	And the tongue of the stammerers will hurry to speak clearly.
ISA.32.5	The fool (the good-for-nothing) will no longer be called noble,
ISA.32.5	Nor the rogue said to be generous.
ISA.32.6	For the fool speaks nonsense,
ISA.32.6	And his heart (mind) plans wickedness:
ISA.32.6	To practice ungodliness and to speak error concerning the L
ISA.32.6	To keep the craving of the hungry unsatisfied
ISA.32.6	And to deprive the thirsty of drink.
ISA.32.7	As for the rogue, his weapons are evil;
ISA.32.7	He conceives wicked plans
ISA.32.7	To ruin the poor with lies,
ISA.32.7	Even when the plea of the needy one is just 
ISA.32.8	But the noble man conceives noble 
ISA.32.8	And he stands by what is noble 
ISA.32.9	Rise up, you women who are carefree,
ISA.32.9	And hear my voice,
ISA.32.9	You confident 
ISA.32.9	Listen to what I am saying.
ISA.32.10	In little more than a year
ISA.32.10	You will tremble [with anxiety], you unsuspecting 
ISA.32.10	For the vintage has ended,
ISA.32.10	And the harvest will not come.
ISA.32.11	Tremble, you women who are carefree;
ISA.32.11	Tremble with fear, you complacent ones!
ISA.32.11	Strip, undress and wear 
ISA.32.12	Beat your breasts [in mourning] for the beautiful fields, for the fruitful vine,
ISA.32.13	For the land of my people growing over with thorns and briars—
ISA.32.13	Yes, [mourn] for all the houses of joy in the joyous city.
ISA.32.14	For the palace has been abandoned, the populated city deserted;
ISA.32.14	The hill [of the city] and the watchtower have become caves [for wild animals] forever,
ISA.32.14	A delight for wild donkeys, a pasture for flocks,
ISA.32.15	Until the Spirit is poured out upon us from on high,
ISA.32.15	And the wilderness becomes a fertile field,
ISA.32.15	And the fertile field is valued as a forest.
ISA.32.16	Then justice will dwell in the wilderness,
ISA.32.16	And righteousness will live in the fertile field.
ISA.32.17	And the effect of righteousness will be peace,
ISA.32.17	And the result of righteousness will be quietness and confident trust forever.
ISA.32.18	Then my people will live in a peaceful surrounding,
ISA.32.18	And in secure dwellings and in undisturbed resting places.
ISA.32.19	But it will hail, when the forest comes down,
ISA.32.19	And the [capital] city will fall in utter humiliation.
ISA.32.20	Blessed (happy, fortunate) are you who cast your seed upon all waters [
ISA.32.20	You who allow the ox and the donkey to roam freely.
ISA.33.1	Woe (judgment is coming) to you, O destroyer,
ISA.33.1	You who were not destroyed,
ISA.33.1	And he who is treacherous, while 
ISA.33.1	As soon as you finish destroying, you will be destroyed;
ISA.33.1	As soon as you stop dealing treacherously,

ISA.33.2	Our salvation also in the time of trouble.
ISA.33.3	At the sound of the tumult, the peoples flee;
ISA.33.3	At the lifting up of Yourself nations scatter.
ISA.33.4	Your spoil [of Israel’s foe] is gathered [by the people of Jerusalem] as the caterpillar gathers;
ISA.33.4	As locusts swarming so people swarm on it.
ISA.33.5	The L
ISA.33.5	He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.
ISA.33.6	And He will be the security 
ISA.33.6	A treasure of salvation, wisdom and knowledge;
ISA.33.6	The fear of the L
ISA.33.7	Now look, their brave men shout outside;
ISA.33.7	The ambassadors [seeking a treaty] of peace weep bitterly.
ISA.33.8	The highways are deserted, the traveler has ceased [to appear].
ISA.33.8	He has no regard for [any] man.
ISA.33.9	The land mourns and dries out,
ISA.33.9	Lebanon is shamed and [its lush foliage] withers;
ISA.33.9	And

ISA.33.10	“Now I will be exalted; now I will be lifted up.
ISA.33.11	You have conceived dried grass, you will give birth to stubble;
ISA.33.11	My breath is a fire that will consume you.
ISA.33.12	The peoples will be burned to lime,
ISA.33.12	Like thorns cut down which are burned in the fire.
ISA.33.13	“You who are far away, hear what I have done;
ISA.33.13	And you who are near, acknowledge My might.”
ISA.33.14	The sinners in Zion are terrified;
ISA.33.14	Trembling has seized the godless.
ISA.33.14	[They cry] “Who among us can live with the consuming fire?
ISA.33.14	Who among us can live with everlasting burning?”
ISA.33.15	He who walks righteously and speaks with integrity,
ISA.33.15	Who rejects gain from fraud 
ISA.33.15	Who shakes his hand free from the taking of bribes,
ISA.33.15	Who stops his ears from hearing about bloodshed
ISA.33.15	And shuts his eyes to avoid looking upon evil;
ISA.33.16	He will dwell on the heights,
ISA.33.16	His place of defense will be the fortress of rocks,
ISA.33.16	His bread will be given him;
ISA.33.16	His water will be permanent.
ISA.33.17	Your eyes will see the King in His beauty;
ISA.33.17	They will see a far-distant land.
ISA.33.18	Your mind will meditate on the terror [asking]:
ISA.33.18	“Where is he who counts?
ISA.33.18	Where is he who weighs [the tribute]?
ISA.33.18	Where is he who counts the towers?”
ISA.33.19	You will no longer see the fierce 
ISA.33.19	A people of unintelligible speech which no one comprehends,
ISA.33.19	Of a strange 
ISA.33.20	Look upon Zion, the city of our appointed feasts 
ISA.33.20	Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a undisturbed settlement,
ISA.33.20	A tent which will not be taken down;
ISA.33.20	Not one of its stakes will ever be pulled up,
ISA.33.20	Nor any of its ropes be severed.
ISA.33.21	But there the mighty

ISA.33.23	Even the lame will take the plunder.
ISA.33.24	And no inhabitant [of Zion] will say, “I am sick”;

ISA.34.4	All the host of heaven will be dissolved,
ISA.34.4	And the skies will be rolled up like a scroll;

ISA.34.10	The burning will not be quenched night or day;
ISA.34.10	Its smoke will go up forever.
ISA.34.10	From generation to generation it will lie in ruins;
ISA.34.10	No one will ever again pass through it.
ISA.34.11	But the pelican and the porcupine will take possession of it;
ISA.34.11	The owl and the raven will dwell in it.

ISA.34.13	An abode for ostriches.

ISA.35.5	Then the eyes of the blind will be opened
ISA.35.5	And the ears of the deaf will be unstopped.
ISA.35.6	Then the lame will leap like a deer,
ISA.35.6	And the tongue of the mute will shout for joy.

ISA.36.1	Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and conquered them. 
ISA.36.2	And the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh [his military commander] from Lachish [the Judean fortress commanding the road from Egypt] to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem with a large army. And he stood by the canal of the Upper Pool on the highway to the Fuller’s Field. 
ISA.36.3	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the [royal] household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recording historian, came out to [meet] him.
ISA.36.4	Then the Rabshakeh said to them, “Say to Hezekiah, ‘This is what the great king, the king of Assyria says, “What is [the reason for] this confidence that you have? 
ISA.36.5	I say, ‘Your plan and strength for the war are only

ISA.36.11	Then Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, “Please, speak to your servants in Aramaic, because we understand it; and do not speak to us in Judean (Hebrew) in the hearing of the people who are [stationed] on the wall.” 
ISA.36.12	But the Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me to speak these words 
ISA.36.13	Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out with a loud voice in Judean (Hebrew): “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria. 
ISA.36.14	This is what the king says, ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to rescue you; 
ISA.36.15	nor let Hezekiah make you trust in the L
ISA.36.16	Do not listen to Hezekiah,’ for this is what the king of Assyria says, ‘Make peace with me and come out to me, and each one of you will eat from his own vine and each from his own fig tree and each [one of you] drink from the water of his own cistern, 
ISA.36.17	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards. 
ISA.36.18	 that Hezekiah does not mislead you by saying, “The L

ISA.36.20	Who among all the gods of these lands have rescued their land from my hand, that [you should think that] the L
ISA.36.21	But they kept silent and did not say a word to him in reply, for King Hezekiah’s command was, “Do not answer him.” 
ISA.36.22	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the household, and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph, the recording historian, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn [in grief], and told him the words of the Rabshakeh [the Assyrian commander].
ISA.37.1	And when King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the L
ISA.37.2	Then he sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the [royal] household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz. 
ISA.37.3	They said to him, “This is what Hezekiah says, ‘This day is a day of distress, rebuke and disgrace; for children have come to birth, and there is no strength to deliver them. 
ISA.37.4	It may be that the L
ISA.37.5	So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 
ISA.37.6	Isaiah said to them, “You shall say the following to your master: ‘This is what the L
ISA.37.7	Listen carefully, I will put a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own land. And I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.” ’ ”
ISA.37.8	So the Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah [a fortified city of Judah], for he had heard that the king had left Lachish. 
ISA.37.9	And Sennacherib king of Assyria, heard 
ISA.37.10	“You shall say to Hezekiah king of Judah, ‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, “Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.” 
ISA.37.11	Listen carefully, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, utterly destroying them. So will you be rescued? 
ISA.37.12	Did the gods of the nations which my fathers destroyed rescue them—
ISA.37.13	Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad [of northern Syria], the king of the city of Sepharvaim, [the king of] Hena, or [the king of] Ivvah?’ ”
ISA.37.14	Then Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it, and he went up to the house of the L
ISA.37.15	And Hezekiah prayed to the L
ISA.37.16	“O L
ISA.37.17	Incline Your ear, O L
ISA.37.18	It is true, O L
ISA.37.19	and have cast the gods [of those peoples] into the fire, for they were not gods but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone. Therefore they have destroyed them. 
ISA.37.20	Now, O L
ISA.37.21	Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent 
ISA.37.22	this is the word that the L
ISA.37.22	“She has shown contempt for you and mocked you,
ISA.37.22	The Virgin Daughter of Zion (Jerusalem);
ISA.37.22	She has shaken her head behind you,
ISA.37.22	The Daughter of Jerusalem!
ISA.37.23	Whom have you taunted and blasphemed?
ISA.37.23	And against whom have you raised your voice
ISA.37.23	And haughtily lifted up your eyes?
ISA.37.23	Against the Holy One of Israel!
ISA.37.24	Through your servants you have taunted 
ISA.37.24	And you have said, ‘With my many chariots I have gone up to the heights of the mountains,
ISA.37.24	To the remotest parts of Lebanon.
ISA.37.24	I cut down its tallest cedars and its choicest cypress trees;
ISA.37.24	And I will go to its remotest height, its most luxuriant 
ISA.37.25	I dug 
ISA.37.25	And with the sole of my feet I dried up
ISA.37.25	All the canals [of the Nile] of Egypt.’
ISA.37.26	Have you not heard [says the God of Israel]
ISA.37.26	That I did it long ago,
ISA.37.26	That I planned it in ancient times?
ISA.37.26	Now I have brought it to pass,
ISA.37.26	That you [king of Assyria] would [be My instrument to] turn fortified cities into ruinous heaps.
ISA.37.27	Therefore their inhabitants had little power,
ISA.37.27	They were terrorized and shamed;
ISA.37.27	They were like the grass of the field and the green vegetation,
ISA.37.27	Like grass on the housetops 
ISA.37.28	But I know your sitting down
ISA.37.28	And your going out and your coming in [every detail of your life],
ISA.37.28	And your raging against Me.
ISA.37.29	Because your raging against Me
ISA.37.29	And your arrogance has come up to My ears,
ISA.37.29	I will put My hook in your nose
ISA.37.29	And My bridle in your 
ISA.37.29	And I will turn you back by the way you came.
ISA.37.30	“This shall be the sign [of these things] to you [Hezekiah]: you are to eat this year 
ISA.37.31	The surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root downward and bear fruit upward. 
ISA.37.32	For out of Jerusalem will come a remnant and from Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the L

ISA.37.36	And the 
ISA.37.37	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned and lived at Nineveh. 
ISA.37.38	It came to pass as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons killed him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat [in Armenia]. And Esarhaddon his son became king in his place.
ISA.38.1	In those days Hezekiah [king of Judah] became sick and was at the point of death. And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him and said, “For the L
ISA.38.2	Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the L

ISA.38.13	I lay down until morning.

ISA.38.13	From day until night You bring me to an end.
ISA.38.14	Like a swallow, like a crane, so I chirp;

ISA.38.17	Indeed, it was for my own well-being that I had such bitterness;
ISA.38.17	But You have loved back my life from the pit of nothingness (destruction),
ISA.38.17	For You have cast all my sins behind Your back.
ISA.38.18	For Sheol cannot praise

ISA.38.21	Now Isaiah had said, “Have them take a cake of figs and rub it [as an ointment] on the inflamed spot, that he may recover.” 
ISA.38.22	Hezekiah also had said, “What is the sign that I will go up to the house of the L
ISA.39.1	At that time Merodach-baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent [messengers with] letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that he had been sick and had recovered. 
ISA.39.2	Hezekiah was pleased and showed them his treasure house—the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, his entire armory and everything that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his house nor in all his area of dominion that Hezekiah did not show them. 
ISA.39.3	Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and asked, “What did these men say? From where have they come to you?” And Hezekiah said, “They came to me from a far country, from 
ISA.39.4	Then Isaiah said, “What have they seen in your house?” And Hezekiah answered, “They have seen everything that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.”
ISA.39.5	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the L

ISA.40.21	Has it not been told to you from the beginning?

ISA.40.22	It is He who sits above the circle of the earth,
ISA.40.22	And its inhabitants are like grasshoppers;
ISA.40.22	[It is He] who stretches out the heavens like a veil

ISA.44.9	All who make carved idols are nothing. Their precious objects are worthless [to them], and their own witnesses (worshipers) fail to see or know, so that they will be put to shame. 
ISA.44.10	Who has made a god or cast an idol which is profitable for nothing? 
ISA.44.11	In fact, all his companions will be put to shame, for the craftsmen themselves are mere men. Let them all assemble, let them stand up, let them be terrified, let them together be put to shame.
ISA.44.12	The ironsmith shapes iron 
ISA.44.13	The carpenter stretches out a measuring line, he marks out the shape [of the idol] with red chalk; he works it with planes and outlines it with the compass; and he makes it like the form of a man, like the beauty of man, that it may sit in a house. 
ISA.44.14	He cuts cedars for himself, and takes a cypress or an oak and lets it grow strong for himself among the trees of the forest. He plants a fir, and the rain nourishes it. 
ISA.44.15	Then it becomes 
ISA.44.16	He burns half of the wood in the fire; over this half he [cooks and] eats meat, he roasts meat and is satisfied. Also he warms himself and says, “Aha! I am warm, I have seen the fire.” 
ISA.44.17	But from what is left of the wood he makes a god, his carved idol. He falls down before it, he worships it and prays to it and says, “Save me, for you are my god.”
ISA.44.18	They do not know, nor do they understand, for God has muddied their eyes so that they cannot see, and their hearts (minds) 
ISA.44.19	No one remembers, nor has knowledge and understanding [enough] to say [to himself], “I have burned half of this log in the fire, and also baked bread on its coals and have roasted meat and eaten it. Then I make the rest of it into an repulsive thing [to God]; I bow down [to worship] before a block of wood!” 
ISA.44.20	That kind of man (the idolater) feeds on ashes [and is satisfied with ashes]! A deceived mind has led him astray, so that he cannot save himself, or ask, “Is this thing [that I am holding] in my right hand not a lie?”
ISA.44.21	“Remember [the foolishness of] these things, O Jacob
ISA.44.21	And Israel, for you are My servant!
ISA.44.21	I formed you, you are My servant;

ISA.45.19	I, the L
ISA.45.19	Declaring things that are upright.
ISA.45.20	“Assemble yourselves and come;
ISA.45.20	Come together, you survivors of the nations!
ISA.45.20	They are ignorant,
ISA.45.20	Who carry around their wooden idols [in religious processions or into battle]
ISA.45.20	And keep on praying to a god that cannot save them.
ISA.45.21	Declare and present 
ISA.45.21	Indeed, let them consult together.
ISA.45.21	Who announced this [rise of Cyrus and his conquests] long before 
ISA.45.21	Who declared it long ago?
ISA.45.21	Was it not I, the L
ISA.45.21	And there is no other God besides Me,
ISA.45.21	A [consistently and uncompromisingly] just 
ISA.45.21	There is none except Me.
ISA.45.22	Turn to Me and be saved, all the ends of the earth;
ISA.45.22	For I am God, and there is no other.
ISA.45.23	I have sworn [an oath] by Myself,
ISA.45.23	The word is gone out of My mouth in righteousness
ISA.45.23	And shall not return,
ISA.45.23	That to Me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear [allegiance].
ISA.45.24	It shall be said of Me, ‘Only in the L

ISA.45.24	And all who were angry at Him will be put to shame.

ISA.46.1	Bel has bowed down, Nebo stoops over;
ISA.46.1	Their idols are on the beasts [of burden] and on the cattle.
ISA.46.1	Your burdens [of idols] are loaded [on them],
ISA.46.1	Burdens on the weary 
ISA.46.2	They stooped over, they have bowed down together;
ISA.46.2	They could not rescue the burden [of their own idols],
ISA.46.2	But have themselves gone into captivity.
ISA.46.3	“Listen to Me,” [says the L
ISA.46.3	And all the remnant of the house of Israel,
ISA.46.3	You who have been carried 
ISA.46.3	And have been carried [in My arms] from the womb,

ISA.46.5	“To whom would you liken Me
ISA.46.5	And make Me equal and compare Me,
ISA.46.5	That we may be alike?
ISA.46.6	Those who lavish gold from the bag
ISA.46.6	And weigh out silver on the scales
ISA.46.6	Hire a goldsmith, and he makes it 
ISA.46.6	They bow down, indeed they worship it.
ISA.46.7	They lift it on their shoulders [in religious processions or into battle] and carry it;
ISA.46.7	They set it in its place and 
ISA.46.7	It cannot move from its place.
ISA.46.7	Even if one cries to it [for help], the idol cannot answer;
ISA.46.7	It cannot save him from his distress.
ISA.46.8	“Remember this, and take courage;
ISA.46.8	Take it to heart, you rebellious 
ISA.46.9	Remember [carefully] the former things [which I did] from ages past;
ISA.46.9	For I am God, and there is no one else;
ISA.46.10	Declaring the end 
ISA.46.10	And from ancient times the things which have not [yet] been done,
ISA.46.10	Saying, ‘My purpose will be established,
ISA.46.10	And I will do all that pleases Me 
ISA.46.11	Calling a bird of prey from the east,
ISA.46.11	From a far country, the man (Cyrus) of My purpose.
ISA.46.11	Truly I have spoken; truly I will bring it to pass.
ISA.46.11	I have planned it, 
ISA.46.12	“Listen to Me, you stiff-necked 
ISA.46.12	You who are far from righteousness (right standing with God).
ISA.46.13	I bring near My righteousness [in the salvation of Israel], it is not far away;
ISA.46.13	And My salvation will not delay.
ISA.46.13	And I will grant salvation in Zion,
ISA.46.13	And My glory for Israel.
ISA.47.1	“Come down and sit in the dust,
ISA.47.1	O virgin daughter of Babylon;
ISA.47.1	Sit on the ground [in abject humiliation]; there is no throne 
ISA.47.1	O daughter of the

ISA.47.2	Take millstones [as a female slave does] and grind meal;
ISA.47.2	Remove your veil, strip off the skirt,
ISA.47.2	Uncover the leg, cross the rivers [at the command of your captors].
ISA.47.3	Your nakedness will be uncovered,
ISA.47.3	Your shame will also be exposed;
ISA.47.3	I will take vengeance and will spare no man.”
ISA.47.4	Our Redeemer [will do all this], the L
ISA.47.4	The Holy One of Israel.
ISA.47.5	“Sit in silence, and go into darkness,
ISA.47.5	O daughter of the Chaldeans;
ISA.47.5	For you will no longer be called
ISA.47.5	The queen of kingdoms.
ISA.47.6	I was angry with My people,
ISA.47.6	I profaned [Judah] My inheritance
ISA.47.6	And gave them into your hand [Babylon].
ISA.47.6	You showed them no mercy;
ISA.47.6	You made your yoke very heavy on the aged.
ISA.47.7	And you said, ‘I shall be a queen forevermore.’
ISA.47.7	You did not consider these things,
ISA.47.7	Nor did you [seriously] remember the [ultimate] outcome of such conduct.
ISA.47.8	“Now, then, hear this, you who live a luxuriant life,
ISA.47.8	You who dwell safely 
ISA.47.8	Who say in your heart (mind),
ISA.47.8	‘I am [the queen], and there is no one besides me.
ISA.47.8	I shall not sit as a widow,
ISA.47.8	Nor know the loss of children.’
ISA.47.9	But these two things shall come to you abruptly, in one day:
ISA.47.9	Loss of children and widowhood.
ISA.47.9	They will come on you in full measure
ISA.47.9	In spite of your many [claims of power through your] sorceries,
ISA.47.9	In spite of the great power of your enchantments.
ISA.47.10	For you [Babylon] have trusted 
ISA.47.10	‘No one sees me.’
ISA.47.10	Your wisdom and your knowledge have led you astray,
ISA.47.10	And you have said in your heart (mind),
ISA.47.10	‘I am, and there is no one besides me.’
ISA.47.11	Therefore disaster will come on you;
ISA.47.11	You will not know how to make it disappear [with your magic].
ISA.47.11	And disaster will fall on you
ISA.47.11	For which you cannot atone [with all your offerings to your gods];
ISA.47.11	And destruction about which you do not know
ISA.47.11	Will come on you suddenly.
ISA.47.12	“Persist, then, [Babylon] in your enchantments
ISA.47.12	And your many sorceries
ISA.47.12	With which you have labored from your youth;
ISA.47.12	Perhaps you will be able to profit [from them],
ISA.47.12	Perhaps you may prevail 
ISA.47.13	You 
ISA.47.13	Just let the astrologers,
ISA.47.13	The stargazers,
ISA.47.13	Those who predict by the new moons [each month]
ISA.47.13	Stand up and save you from the things that will come upon you [Babylon].
ISA.47.14	In fact, they are like stubble;
ISA.47.14	Fire burns them.
ISA.47.14	They cannot save themselves from the power of the flame [much less save the nation],
ISA.47.14	There is no blazing coal for warming
ISA.47.14	Nor fire before which to sit!
ISA.47.15	This is how they have become to you, those [astrologers and sorcerers] with whom you have labored,
ISA.47.15	Those who have done business with you from your youth;
ISA.47.15	Each has wandered in his own way.
ISA.47.15	There is no one to save you.
ISA.48.1	“Hear this, O house of Jacob, you who are called by the name of Israel
ISA.48.1	And who come from the

ISA.48.2	The L
ISA.48.3	I have declared the former things [which happened to Israel] in times past;
ISA.48.3	They went forth from My mouth and I proclaimed them;
ISA.48.3	Suddenly I acted, and they came to pass.
ISA.48.4	Because I know that you are obstinate,
ISA.48.4	And your neck is an iron tendon
ISA.48.4	And your brow is bronze [both unyielding],
ISA.48.5	I have declared them to you long ago;
ISA.48.5	Before they came to pass I announced them to you,
ISA.48.5	So that you could not say, ‘My idol has done them,
ISA.48.5	And my carved image and my cast image have commanded them.’
ISA.48.6	You have heard [these things foretold]; look at all this [that has been fulfilled].
ISA.48.6	And you, will you not declare it?
ISA.48.6	I proclaim to you [specific] new things from this time,
ISA.48.6	Even 
ISA.48.7	They are created now [called into being by the prophetic word] and not long ago;
ISA.48.7	And before today you have not heard of them,
ISA.48.7	So that you will not say, ‘Oh yes! I knew them.’
ISA.48.8	You have not heard, you have not known;
ISA.48.8	Even from long ago your ear has not been open.
ISA.48.8	For I [the L
ISA.48.8	You have been called a transgressor 
ISA.48.9	For the sake of My Name I refrain from My wrath,
ISA.48.9	And 
ISA.48.9	So that I do not cut you off.
ISA.48.10	Indeed, I have refined you, but not as 
ISA.48.10	I have tested 
ISA.48.11	For My own sake, for My own sake, I will do it [I refrain and do not completely destroy you];
ISA.48.11	For how can 
ISA.48.11	And I will not give My glory to another [by permitting the worshipers of idols to triumph over you].
ISA.48.12	“Listen to Me, O Jacob, and Israel, whom I called;
ISA.48.12	I am He, I am the First, I am the Last.
ISA.48.13	My hand founded 
ISA.48.13	And My right hand spread out the heavens;
ISA.48.13	When I call to them, they stand together [in obedience to carry out My decrees].
ISA.48.14	Assemble, all of you, and listen!
ISA.48.14	Who among them [the idols and Chaldean astrologers] has declared these things?
ISA.48.14	The L
ISA.48.14	And his arm 
ISA.48.15	I, even I, have spoken; indeed, I have called Cyrus;
ISA.48.15	I have brought him, and will make his way successful.
ISA.48.16	Come near to Me, listen to this:
ISA.48.16	From the beginning I have not spoken in secret,
ISA.48.16	From the time that it happened, I was there.
ISA.48.16	And now the Lord G
ISA.48.17	This is what the L
ISA.48.17	“I am the L
ISA.48.17	Who leads you in the way that you should go.
ISA.48.18	Oh, that you had paid attention to My commandments!
ISA.48.18	Then your peace 
ISA.48.18	And your righteousness [the holiness and purity of the nation] like the [abundant] waves of the sea.
ISA.48.19	Your offspring would have been like the sand,
ISA.48.19	And your descendants [in number] like the grains of sand;
ISA.48.19	Their name would never be cut off or destroyed from My presence.”
ISA.48.20	Get out of Babylon! Flee from the Chaldeans [who reign there]!
ISA.48.20	Declare with a voice of jubilation, proclaim this,
ISA.48.20	Send it out to the end of the earth;
ISA.48.20	Say, “The L

ISA.48.21	He made the waters flow out of the rock for them;
ISA.48.21	He split the rock and the waters flowed.
ISA.48.22	“There is no peace for the wicked,” says the L

ISA.49.2	In His quiver He has hidden Me.
ISA.49.3	And [the L

ISA.49.4	Then I said, “I have labored in vain,
ISA.49.4	I have spent My strength for nothing and vanity (pride, uselessness);
ISA.49.4	However My justice is with the L
ISA.49.4	And My reward is with My God.”
ISA.49.5	And now says the L
ISA.49.5	To bring Jacob back to Him and that Israel might be gathered to Him,
ISA.49.5	—For I am honored in the eyes of the L
ISA.49.5	And My God is My strength—
ISA.49.6	He says, “It is too trivial a thing that You should be My Servant
ISA.49.6	To raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the

ISA.49.6	That My salvation may reach to the end of the earth.”
ISA.49.7	This is what the L

ISA.49.7	To the One hated by the nation
ISA.49.7	To the Servant of rulers,

ISA.51.20	Like an antelope in a net,
ISA.51.20	Full [from drinking] of the wrath of the L
ISA.51.20	The rebuke of your God.
ISA.51.21	Therefore, now hear this, you who are afflicted,
ISA.51.21	Who are drunk, but not with wine [but overwhelmed by the wrath of God].
ISA.51.22	So says your Lord, the L
ISA.51.22	Who pleads the cause of His people,
ISA.51.22	“Listen carefully, I have taken from your hand the cup of staggering 
ISA.51.22	The cup of My wrath;
ISA.51.22	You shall never drink it again.
ISA.51.23	I will put it into the hands of your tormentors,
ISA.51.23	Who have said to you, ‘Lie down so that we may walk over you.’
ISA.51.23	You have even made your back like the ground
ISA.51.23	And like the street for those who walk over it.”
ISA.52.1	Awake, awake,
ISA.52.1	Put on your strength, O Zion;
ISA.52.1	Put on your beautiful garments,
ISA.52.1	O Jerusalem, the holy city;
ISA.52.1	For the uncircumcised and the unclean
ISA.52.1	Will no longer come into you.
ISA.52.2	Shake yourself from the dust, arise,
ISA.52.2	O captive Jerusalem;
ISA.52.2	Rid yourself of the chains around your neck,
ISA.52.2	O captive Daughter of Zion.
ISA.52.3	For the L
ISA.52.4	For the Lord G
ISA.52.5	But now, what do I have here,” declares the L
ISA.52.6	Therefore My people shall know My Name 
ISA.52.7	How beautiful 
ISA.52.7	Are the feet of him who brings good news,
ISA.52.7	Who announces peace,
ISA.52.7	Who brings good news of good [things],
ISA.52.7	Who announces salvation,
ISA.52.7	Who says to Zion, “Your God reigns!”
ISA.52.8	Listen! Your watchmen lift up their voices,
ISA.52.8	Together they shout for joy;
ISA.52.8	For they will see face to face
ISA.52.8	The return of the L
ISA.52.9	Break forth, shout joyfully together,
ISA.52.9	You ruins of Jerusalem;
ISA.52.9	For the L
ISA.52.9	He has redeemed Jerusalem.
ISA.52.10	The L
ISA.52.10	Before the eyes of all the nations [revealing Himself as the One by Whom Israel is redeemed from captivity],
ISA.52.10	That all the ends of the earth may see
ISA.52.10	The salvation of our God.
ISA.52.11	Depart, depart, go out from there (the lands of exile),
ISA.52.11	Touch no unclean thing;
ISA.52.11	Go out of the midst of her (Babylon), purify yourselves,
ISA.52.11	You who carry the articles of the L
ISA.52.12	For you will not go out in a hurry [as when you left Egypt],
ISA.52.12	Nor will you go in flight [fleeing, as you did from the Egyptians];
ISA.52.12	For the L
ISA.52.12	And the God of Israel will be your rear guard.
ISA.52.13	Indeed, My Servant (the Messiah) will act wisely 
ISA.52.13	He will be raised and lifted up and greatly exalted.
ISA.52.14	Just as many were astonished 
ISA.52.14	So His appearance was marred more than any man
ISA.52.14	And His form [marred] more than the sons of men.
ISA.52.15	So He will sprinkle many nations [with His blood, providing salvation],
ISA.52.15	Kings will shut their mouths because of Him;
ISA.52.15	For what they had not been told they will see,
ISA.52.15	And what they had not heard they will understand.
ISA.53.1	Who has believed [confidently trusted in, relied on, and adhered to] our message [of salvation]?
ISA.53.1	And to whom [if not us] has the arm 
ISA.53.2	For He [the Servant of God] grew up before Him like a tender shoot (plant),
ISA.53.2	And like a root out of dry ground;
ISA.53.2	He has no 
ISA.53.2	That we would look at Him,
ISA.53.2	Nor [handsome] appearance that we would 
ISA.53.3	He was despised and rejected by men,
ISA.53.3	A Man of sorrows 
ISA.53.3	And like One from whom men hide their faces
ISA.53.3	He was despised, and we did not appreciate His worth 
ISA.53.4	But [in fact] He has borne our griefs,
ISA.53.4	And He has carried our sorrows 
ISA.53.4	Yet we [ignorantly] assumed that He was stricken,
ISA.53.4	Struck down by God and degraded 
ISA.53.5	But He was wounded for our transgressions,
ISA.53.5	He was crushed for our wickedness [our sin, our injustice, our wrongdoing];
ISA.53.5	The punishment [required] for our well-being 
ISA.53.5	And by His stripes (wounds) we are healed.
ISA.53.6	All of us like sheep have gone astray,
ISA.53.6	We have turned, each one, to his own way;
ISA.53.6	But the L
ISA.53.6	To fall on Him [instead of us].
ISA.53.7	He was oppressed and He was afflicted,
ISA.53.7	Yet He did not open His mouth [to complain or defend Himself];
ISA.53.7	Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,
ISA.53.7	And like a sheep that is silent before her shearers,
ISA.53.7	So He did not open His mouth.
ISA.53.8	And 
ISA.53.8	That He was cut off from the land of the living [by His death]
ISA.53.8	For the transgression of my people, to whom the stroke [of death] 
ISA.53.9	His grave was assigned with the wicked,
ISA.53.9	But He was with a rich man in His death,
ISA.53.9	Because He had done no violence,
ISA.53.9	Nor was there any deceit in His mouth.
ISA.53.10	Yet the L
ISA.53.10	To crush Him, 
ISA.53.10	If 
ISA.53.10	He shall see 
ISA.53.10	He shall prolong 
ISA.53.10	And the will (good pleasure) of the L
ISA.53.11	As a result of the 
ISA.53.11	He shall see it and be satisfied;
ISA.53.11	By His knowledge [of what He has accomplished] the Righteous One,
ISA.53.11	My Servant, shall justify the many [making them righteous—upright before God, in right standing with Him],
ISA.53.11	For He shall bear [the responsibility for] their sins.
ISA.53.12	Therefore, I will divide 
ISA.53.12	And He shall divide the spoils with the mighty,
ISA.53.12	Because He [willingly] poured out His life to death,
ISA.53.12	And was counted among the transgressors;
ISA.53.12	Yet He Himself bore 
ISA.53.12	And interceded [with the Father] for the transgressors.
ISA.54.1	“Shout for joy, O barren one, she who has not given birth;
ISA.54.1	Break forth into joyful shouting and rejoice, she who has not gone into labor [with child]!
ISA.54.1	For the [spiritual] sons of the desolate one 
ISA.54.1	Than the sons of the married woman,” says the L

ISA.54.2	Lengthen your tent ropes

ISA.54.3	For you will spread out to the right and to the left;
ISA.54.3	And your descendants will take possession of nations
ISA.54.3	And will inhabit deserted cities.
ISA.54.4	“Do not fear, for you will not be put to shame,
ISA.54.4	And do not feel humiliated 
ISA.54.4	For you will forget the shame of your youth,
ISA.54.4	And you will no longer remember the disgrace of your widowhood.
ISA.54.5	For your husband is your Maker,
ISA.54.5	The L
ISA.54.5	And your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel,
ISA.54.5	Who is called the God of the whole earth.
ISA.54.6	For the L
ISA.54.6	Like a wife who has been abandoned, grieved in spirit,

ISA.54.7	“For a brief moment I abandoned you,
ISA.54.7	But with great compassion 
ISA.54.8	In an outburst of wrath
ISA.54.8	I hid My face from you for a moment,
ISA.54.8	But with everlasting kindness I will have compassion on you,”
ISA.54.8	Says the L
ISA.54.9	“For this is 
ISA.54.9	As I swore [an oath] that the waters of Noah
ISA.54.9	Would not flood the earth again;
ISA.54.9	In the same way I have sworn that I will not be angry with you
ISA.54.9	Nor will I rebuke you.

ISA.54.15	If anyone fiercely attacks you it will not be from Me.

ISA.58.4	The facts are that you fast 
ISA.58.4	You do not fast as 
ISA.58.5	Is a fast such as this what I have chosen, a day for a man to humble himself [with sorrow in his soul]?
ISA.58.5	Is it 
ISA.58.5	And to make sackcloth and ashes as a bed [pretending to have a repentant heart]?
ISA.58.5	Do you call this a fast and a day pleasing to the L
ISA.58.6	[Rather] is this not the fast which I choose,
ISA.58.6	To undo the bonds of wickedness,
ISA.58.6	To tear to pieces the ropes of the yoke,
ISA.58.6	To let the oppressed go free
ISA.58.6	And break apart every [enslaving] yoke?

ISA.58.12	And your people will rebuild the ancient ruins;
ISA.58.12	You will raise up

ISA.58.12	Restorer of Streets 
ISA.58.13	“If you turn back your foot from [

ISA.59.4	No one sues righteously [but for the sake of doing injury to others—to take some undue advantage], and no one pleads [his case] in truth; [but rather]
ISA.59.4	They trust in empty

ISA.59.6	Nor will they cover themselves with what they make;
ISA.59.6	Their works are works of wickedness [of sin, of injustice, of wrongdoing],
ISA.59.6	And the act of violence is in their hands.
ISA.59.7	Their feet run to evil,
ISA.59.7	And they rush to shed innocent blood.
ISA.59.7	Their thoughts are thoughts of wickedness [of sin, of injustice, of wrongdoing];
ISA.59.7	Devastation and destruction are in their highways.
ISA.59.8	They do not know the way of peace,
ISA.59.8	And there is no justice in their tracks.
ISA.59.8	They have made them into crooked paths;

ISA.59.9	We [expectantly] hope for light, but only see darkness;
ISA.59.10	We grope for a wall like the blind,
ISA.59.10	We grope like those who have no eyes.
ISA.59.10	We stumble at midday as in the twilight;
ISA.59.10	Among those who are healthy 
ISA.59.11	We all groan 
ISA.59.11	And coo sadly like doves;
ISA.59.11	We hope for justice, but there is none,
ISA.59.11	For salvation, but it is far from us.
ISA.59.12	For our transgressions are multiplied before You [O L

ISA.59.13	Speaking oppression and revolt,
ISA.59.13	Conceiving and muttering from the heart lying words.
ISA.59.14	Justice is pushed back,
ISA.59.14	And righteous behavior stands far away;
ISA.59.14	For truth has fallen in the city square,
ISA.59.14	And 
ISA.59.15	Yes, truth is missing;
ISA.59.15	And he who turns away from evil makes himself a prey.
ISA.59.15	And it 
ISA.59.16	He saw that there was no man,
ISA.59.16	And was amazed that there was no one to intercede [on behalf of truth and right];
ISA.59.16	Therefore His own arm brought salvation to Him,
ISA.59.16	And His own righteousness sustained Him.
ISA.59.17	For He [the L
ISA.59.17	And salvation like a helmet on His head;
ISA.59.17	He put on garments of vengeance for clothing
ISA.59.17	And covered Himself with zeal [and great love for His people] as a cloak.
ISA.59.18	As their deeds deserve, so He will repay:
ISA.59.18	Wrath to His adversaries, retribution to His enemies;
ISA.59.18	To the islands 
ISA.59.19	So they will fear the name of the L

ISA.63.1	“It is I, [the One] who speaks in righteousness [proclaiming vindication], mighty to save.”
ISA.63.2	Why is Your apparel red,
ISA.63.2	And Your garments like the one who treads in the wine press?
ISA.63.3	“I have trodden the wine trough alone,
ISA.63.3	And of the peoples there was no one with Me.

ISA.63.3	And I stained all My clothes.
ISA.63.4	For the day of vengeance [against ungodliness] was in My heart,
ISA.63.4	And My year of redemption [of those who put their trust in Me—the year of My redeemed] has come.
ISA.63.5	I looked, but there was no one to help,
ISA.63.5	And I was amazed 
ISA.63.5	So My own arm brought salvation to Me,
ISA.63.5	And My wrath sustained Me.
ISA.63.6	I trampled the peoples in My anger
ISA.63.6	And made them drunk with [the cup of] My wrath,
ISA.63.6	And I spilled their lifeblood on the earth.”
ISA.63.7	I will tell of the lovingkindnesses of the L

ISA.63.7	And 
ISA.63.7	Which He has shown them according to His compassion
ISA.63.7	And according to the abundance of His lovingkindnesses.
ISA.63.8	For He said, “Be assured, they are My people,
ISA.63.8	Sons who will not be faithless.”
ISA.63.8	So He became their Savior [in all their distresses].
ISA.63.9	In all their distress He was distressed,
ISA.63.9	And the 
ISA.63.9	In His love and in His compassion He redeemed them;
ISA.63.9	And He lifted them up and carried them all the days of old.
ISA.63.10	But they rebelled
ISA.63.10	And grieved His Holy Spirit;
ISA.63.10	Therefore He changed into their enemy,
ISA.63.10	And He fought against them.
ISA.63.11	Then His people remembered the days of old, of Moses [and they said],
ISA.63.11	Where is He who brought our fathers up out of the [Red] Sea, with the shepherds of His flock [Moses and Aaron]?
ISA.63.11	Where is He who put His Holy Spirit in their midst,
ISA.63.12	Who caused His glorious arm 
ISA.63.12	Dividing the waters before them to make for Himself an everlasting name,
ISA.63.13	Who led them through the depths [of the Red Sea],
ISA.63.13	Like a horse in the wilderness, [so that] they did not stumble?
ISA.63.14	Like the cattle that go down into the valley [to find better pasture and rest],

ISA.63.15	Look down from heaven and see from Your lofty dwelling place, holy and glorious.
ISA.63.15	Where are Your zeal and Your mighty acts [Your miracles which you did for Your people]?
ISA.63.15	The stirring of Your heart and Your compassion are restrained 
ISA.63.16	For [most certainly] You are our Father, even though Abraham [our ancestor] does not know us
ISA.63.16	And Israel does not acknowledge us.
ISA.63.16	You, O L
ISA.63.16	Our Redeemer from everlasting is Your name.
ISA.63.17	O L
ISA.63.17	And harden our heart from fearing You [with reverence and awe]?
ISA.63.17	Return for Your servants’ sake, the tribes of Your heritage.
ISA.63.18	Your holy people possessed Your sanctuary for [only] a little while;
ISA.63.18	Our adversaries have trampled it down.
ISA.63.19	We have become 
ISA.64.1	Oh, that You would tear open the heavens and come down,
ISA.64.1	That the mountains might quake at Your presence—
ISA.64.2	As [sure as] fire kindles the brushwood, as fire causes water to boil—
ISA.64.2	To make Your name known to Your adversaries,
ISA.64.2	That the nations may tremble at Your presence!
ISA.64.3	When You did awesome 
ISA.64.3	You came down [at Sinai]; the mountains quaked at Your presence.
ISA.64.4	For from days of old no one has heard, nor has ear perceived,
ISA.64.4	Nor has the eye 
ISA.64.4	Who works 
ISA.64.5	You meet him who rejoices in doing that which is morally right,
ISA.64.5	Who remembers You in Your ways.
ISA.64.5	Indeed, You were angry, for we sinned;
ISA.64.5	And shall we be saved [under such circumstances]?
ISA.64.6	For we all have become like one who is [ceremonially] unclean [like a leper],
ISA.64.6	And all our deeds of righteousness are like filthy rags;
ISA.64.6	We all wither 
ISA.64.6	And our wickedness [our sin, our injustice, our wrongdoing], like the wind, takes us away [carrying us far from God’s favor, toward destruction].
ISA.64.7	There is no one who calls on Your name,
ISA.64.7	Who awakens 
ISA.64.7	For You have hidden Your face from us
ISA.64.7	And have handed us over to the [consuming and destructive] power of our wickedness [our sin, our injustice, our wrongdoing].
ISA.64.8	Yet, O L
ISA.64.8	We are the clay, and You our Potter,
ISA.64.8	And we all are the work of Your hand.
ISA.64.9	Do not be angry beyond measure, O L
ISA.64.9	Do not remember our wickedness [our sin, our injustice, our wrongdoing] forever.
ISA.64.9	Now look, consider, for we are all Your people.
ISA.64.10	Zion has become a wilderness,
ISA.64.10	Jerusalem a desolation.
ISA.64.11	Our holy and beautiful house [the temple built by Solomon],
ISA.64.11	Where our fathers praised You,
ISA.64.11	Has been burned by fire;
ISA.64.11	And all our precious objects are in ruins.
ISA.64.12	Considering these [tragedies], will You restrain Yourself, O L
ISA.64.12	Will You keep silent and humiliate 
ISA.65.1	“I let Myself be sought by those who did not ask 
ISA.65.1	I let Myself be found by those who did not seek Me.

JER.1.1	The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, [one] of the priests who were in

JER.1.4	Now the word of the L

JER.1.19	They will fight against you, but they will not [ultimately] prevail over you, for I am with you [always] to protect you

JER.2.21	A completely faithful seed.

JER.2.23	Look at your way in the valley;

JER.2.23	You are a swift

JER.2.24	That sniffs the wind in her passion [for the scent of a mate].
JER.2.24	In her mating season who can restrain her?
JER.2.24	No males seeking her need to weary themselves;

JER.2.33	To seek 
JER.2.33	Even the most wicked of women
JER.2.33	Have learned [indecent] ways from you.

JER.2.34	The lifeblood of the innocent poor;

JER.2.36	Why do you go around 
JER.2.36	Changing your way?
JER.2.36	Also, you will be shamed by Egypt
JER.2.36	As you were shamed by Assyria.

JER.4.19	I cannot be silent,
JER.4.19	For you have heard, O my soul,
JER.4.19	The sound of the trumpet,
JER.4.19	The alarm of war.
JER.4.20	News of one [terrible] disaster comes close after another,
JER.4.20	For the whole land is devastated;

JER.4.22	“For My people are stupid

JER.4.23	I looked at the earth [in my vision], and behold, it was [as at the time of creation] formless and void;

JER.4.24	And all the hills moved back and forth.
JER.4.25	I looked, and behold, there was no man,
JER.4.25	And all the birds of the air had fled.
JER.4.26	I looked, and behold, the fertile land was a wilderness,

JER.4.28	And I will not change my mind (relent), nor will I turn back from it.”
JER.4.29	Every city runs away at the sound of the horsemen and archers.
JER.4.29	They go into the thickets and climb among the rocks;
JER.4.29	Every city is deserted,
JER.4.29	And no man lives in them.
JER.4.30	And you, O desolate one, what will you do?
JER.4.30	Though you clothe yourself in scarlet,
JER.4.30	Though you adorn 
JER.4.30	Though you enlarge your eyes with paint,
JER.4.30	You make yourself beautiful in vain.
JER.4.30	Your lovers (allies) despise you;
JER.4.30	They seek your life.
JER.4.31	For I heard a cry like a woman in labor,
JER.4.31	The anguish as of one giving birth to her first child,
JER.4.31	The cry of the Daughter of Zion (Jerusalem), who gasps for breath,
JER.4.31	Who stretches out her hands, saying,
JER.4.31	“Woe is me [my judgment comes]! I faint [in fear] before the murderers.”
JER.5.1	“Roam back and forth through the streets of Jerusalem,

JER.5.1	Then I will pardon Jerusalem—[for the sake of one uncompromisingly righteous person].
JER.5.2	And though they say, ‘As the L
JER.5.2	Surely they swear [their oaths] falsely.”
JER.5.3	O L
JER.5.3	You [have seen their faithless heart and] have stricken them,
JER.5.3	But they did not weaken;
JER.5.3	You have consumed them,
JER.5.3	But they refused to take correction 
JER.5.3	They have made their faces harder than rock;
JER.5.3	They have refused to repent 
JER.5.4	Then I said, “[Surely] these are only the poor (uneducated);
JER.5.4	They are [sinfully] foolish 
JER.5.4	For they do not know the way of the L
JER.5.4	Or the ordinance of their God [and the requirements of His just and righteous law].
JER.5.5	I will go to the great [men]
JER.5.5	And speak to them,
JER.5.5	For they [must] know the way of the L
JER.5.5	The ordinance of their God.”
JER.5.5	But [I found the reverse to be true, that] they too had all alike broken the yoke [of God’s law]
JER.5.5	And had burst the bonds [of obedience to Him].
JER.5.6	Therefore a lion from the forest will kill them,
JER.5.6	A wolf of the deserts will destroy them,
JER.5.6	A leopard is watching their cities.
JER.5.6	Everyone who goes out of them shall be torn in pieces,
JER.5.6	Because their transgressions are many,
JER.5.6	Their desertions of faith are countless.
JER.5.7	“Why should I [overlook these offenses and] forgive you?
JER.5.7	Your children have abandoned (rejected) Me
JER.5.7	And sworn [their oaths] by those who are not gods.
JER.5.7	When I had fed them until they were full [and bound them to Me by a promise],
JER.5.7	They committed [spiritual] adultery,
JER.5.7	Assembling in troops at the houses of prostitutes (idols).
JER.5.8	They were like well-fed, lusty stallions,
JER.5.8	Each one neighing after his neighbor’s wife.
JER.5.9	Shall I not punish them [for these things]?” says the L
JER.5.9	“Shall I not avenge Myself
JER.5.9	On a nation such as this?”
JER.5.10	“Go up through the rows of Jerusalem’s vineyards and destroy [them],
JER.5.10	But do not completely destroy 
JER.5.10	Strip away her branches 
JER.5.10	For they are not the L
JER.5.11	For the house of Israel and the house of Judah
JER.5.11	Have dealt very treacherously (faithlessly) with Me,” declares the L
JER.5.12	They have lied about 
JER.5.12	By saying, “It is not He [who speaks through His prophets];
JER.5.12	Misfortune 
JER.5.12	Nor will we see war or famine.
JER.5.13	The prophets are like the 
JER.5.13	And the word [of God] is not in them.
JER.5.13	In this manner it will be done to them [as they prophesied, not to us].”
JER.5.14	Therefore, thus says the L
JER.5.14	“Because you [people] have spoken this word,
JER.5.14	Behold, I am making My words a fire in your mouth [Jeremiah]
JER.5.14	And this people wood, and My words will consume them.
JER.5.15	Behold, I am bringing a nation against you from far away, O house of Israel,” says the L
JER.5.15	“It is a mighty 
JER.5.15	It is an ancient nation,
JER.5.15	A nation whose language you do not know,
JER.5.15	Whose words you do not comprehend.
JER.5.16	Their quiver is [filled with the dead] like an open grave;
JER.5.16	They are all mighty men [heroes of their nation].
JER.5.17	They will consume your harvest and [eat up] your bread;
JER.5.17	They will consume your sons and your daughters;
JER.5.17	They will consume your flocks and your herds;
JER.5.17	They will consume your vines and your fig trees.
JER.5.17	With the sword they will break down 
JER.5.18	“But even in those days,” says the L
JER.5.19	It will come about when your people say, ‘Why has the L
JER.5.20	“Declare this in the house of Jacob
JER.5.20	And proclaim it in Judah, saying:
JER.5.21	‘Now hear this, O foolish people without heart,
JER.5.21	Who have eyes but do not see,
JER.5.21	Who have ears but do not hear.
JER.5.22	Do you not fear Me?’ says the L
JER.5.22	‘Do you not tremble [in awe] in My presence?
JER.5.22	For I have placed the sand as a boundary for the sea,
JER.5.22	An eternal decree 
JER.5.22	Though the waves [of the sea] toss 
JER.5.22	Though the waves 
JER.5.22	[Is not such a God to be feared?]
JER.5.23	But this people has a stubborn heart and a rebellious will [that draws them away from Me];
JER.5.23	They have turned away and have gone [into idolatry].
JER.5.24	They do not say in their heart,
JER.5.24	“Let us now fear 
JER.5.24	Who gives rain in its season,
JER.5.24	Both the autumn and the spring rain,
JER.5.24	Who keeps for us
JER.5.24	The appointed weeks of the harvest.”
JER.5.25	Your wickedness has turned these [blessings] away,
JER.5.25	And your sins have withheld good [harvests] from you.
JER.5.26	For wicked men are found among My people,
JER.5.26	They watch like fowlers who lie in wait;
JER.5.26	They set a trap,
JER.5.26	They catch men.
JER.5.27	As a cage is full of birds,
JER.5.27	So are their houses full of deceit 
JER.5.27	Therefore they have become influential and rich.
JER.5.28	They are fat and they are sleek (prosperous),
JER.5.28	They 
JER.5.28	They do not plead the cause,
JER.5.28	The cause of the orphan, so that they [the wicked] may prosper,
JER.5.28	And they do not defend the rights of the poor.
JER.5.29	Shall I not punish them [for these things]?’ says the L
JER.5.29	‘Shall I not avenge Myself
JER.5.29	On such a nation as this?’
JER.5.30	“An appalling and horrible thing [bringing desolation and destruction]
JER.5.30	Has come to pass in the land:
JER.5.31	The prophets prophesy falsely,
JER.5.31	And the priests rule 
JER.5.31	And My people love [to have] it so!
JER.5.31	But what will you do when the end comes?
JER.6.1	“Run for safety, you children of Benjamin,
JER.6.1	Out of the midst of Jerusalem!
JER.6.1	And blow a trumpet in Tekoa [in Judah]
JER.6.1	And raise a signal-fire in Beth-haccherem [near Jerusalem];
JER.6.1	For evil is looking down [with eager anticipation] from the north,
JER.6.1	And great destruction.
JER.6.2	I will destroy the Daughter of Zion (Jerusalem), the lovely and delicate one [so like a luxurious pasture].
JER.6.3	Shepherds with their flocks will come against her;
JER.6.3	They will pitch their tents all around her;
JER.6.3	They will pasture, each one in his place [eating up all her rich grasses].
JER.6.4	[They shout], ‘Prepare for war against her;
JER.6.4	Arise, let us [take her by surprise and] attack her at noon.
JER.6.4	But alas, the daylight pales,
JER.6.4	The evening shadows grow long.
JER.6.5	Arise, let us [awaken to] attack her at night
JER.6.5	And destroy her [fortified] palaces!’ ”
JER.6.6	For the L
JER.6.6	“Cut down her trees
JER.6.6	And build a siege [mound] against Jerusalem.
JER.6.6	This is the city which must be punished;
JER.6.6	There is nothing but oppression inside her [walls].
JER.6.7	As a fountain springs up 
JER.6.7	So she [continually] pours out her fresh wickedness.
JER.6.7	Violence and destruction are heard inside her [walls];
JER.6.7	Sickness and wounds are always before Me.
JER.6.8	Be wise 
JER.6.8	Or I will be alienated from you,
JER.6.8	And make you a desolation,
JER.6.8	An uninhabited land.”
JER.6.9	Thus says the L
JER.6.9	“They will thoroughly gather like [fruit on] a vine what is left of Israel;
JER.6.9	Pass your hand [over the vine] again 
JER.6.9	Over the branches [stripping the tendrils off the vine].”
JER.6.10	To whom shall I (Jeremiah) speak and give warning
JER.6.10	That they may hear?
JER.6.10	Behold, their ears are 
JER.6.10	And they cannot listen.
JER.6.10	Behold, the word of the L
JER.6.10	They have no delight in it.
JER.6.11	But I am full of the wrath (judgment) of the L
JER.6.11	I am tired of restraining it.
JER.6.11	“[I will] pour it out on the children in the street
JER.6.11	And on the young men gathered together;
JER.6.11	For both the husband and wife shall be taken,
JER.6.11	The aged and the very old [though full of days they are not exempt from judgment].
JER.6.12	Their houses shall be turned over to others,
JER.6.12	Their fields and their wives together;
JER.6.12	For I will stretch out My hand
JER.6.12	Against the inhabitants of the land,” says the L
JER.6.13	“For from the least of them even to the greatest of them,
JER.6.13	Everyone is greedy for [unfair] gain;
JER.6.13	And from the prophet even to the priest
JER.6.13	Everyone deals deceitfully.
JER.6.14	They have treated superficially the [bloody] broken wound of My people,
JER.6.14	Saying, ‘Peace, peace,’
JER.6.14	When there is no peace.
JER.6.15	Were they ashamed because they had committed disgusting 
JER.6.15	No, they were not at all ashamed;
JER.6.15	They did not even know how to blush [at their idolatry].
JER.6.15	Therefore they will fall among those who fall;
JER.6.15	At the time that I punish them
JER.6.15	They will be overthrown,” says the L
JER.6.16	Thus says the L
JER.6.16	“Stand by the roads and look; ask for the ancient paths,
JER.6.16	Where the good way is; then walk in it,
JER.6.16	And you will find rest for your souls.
JER.6.16	But they said, ‘We will not walk in it!’
JER.6.17	I have set watchmen (prophets) over you,
JER.6.17	Saying, ‘Listen

JER.6.19	Hear, O earth: behold, I am bringing disaster on this people,
JER.6.19	The fruit of their schemes,
JER.6.19	Because they have not listened 
JER.6.19	And as for My law, they have rejected it also.
JER.6.20	For what purpose does frankincense come to Me from 
JER.6.20	And the sweet cane from a distant land?
JER.6.20	Your burnt offerings are not acceptable
JER.6.20	And your sacrifices are not sweet 
JER.6.21	Therefore, thus says the L
JER.6.21	“Behold, I am laying stumbling blocks before this people.
JER.6.21	The fathers and the sons together
JER.6.21	Will stumble against them;
JER.6.21	The neighbor and his friend will perish.”
JER.6.22	Thus says the L
JER.6.22	“Behold, a people is coming from the north country,
JER.6.22	And a great nation shall be stirred up 
JER.6.23	They seize bow and spear;
JER.6.23	They are cruel 
JER.6.23	Their voice sounds like the roaring sea;
JER.6.23	They ride [in formation] on horses,
JER.6.23	Arrayed as a man for battle
JER.6.23	Against you, O Daughter of Zion (Jerusalem)!”
JER.6.24	We have heard the report of it;
JER.6.24	Our hands become limp 
JER.6.24	Anguish has gripped us,
JER.6.24	Pain like that of a woman in childbirth.
JER.6.25	Do not go out into the field
JER.6.25	Nor walk on the road,
JER.6.25	For the enemy is armed with the sword;
JER.6.25	Terror is on every side.
JER.6.26	O daughter of my people [says Jeremiah],
JER.6.26	Clothe yourself in sackcloth and wallow in ashes;
JER.6.26	Mourn [aloud] as for an only son,
JER.6.26	A most bitter cry [of sorrow and regret],
JER.6.26	For suddenly the destroyer will come upon us [on both prophet and people].
JER.6.27	“I [the L
JER.6.27	That you may know and analyze their acts.”
JER.6.28	They are all the worst [kind] of [stiff-necked, godless] rebels,
JER.6.28	Going around spreading slander.
JER.6.28	They are [not gold and silver ore, but] bronze and iron;
JER.6.28	They are all corrupt.
JER.6.29	The bellows blow fiercely,
JER.6.29	The lead is consumed by the fire;
JER.6.29	In vain they continue refining,
JER.6.29	But the wicked are not separated 
JER.6.30	They call them rejected silver [only dross, without value],
JER.6.30	Because the L

JER.7.4	Do not trust in the deceptive 
JER.7.5	For if you thoroughly change your ways and your behavior, if you thoroughly 
JER.7.6	if you do not oppress the transient 
JER.7.7	then I will let you live in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers [to live in] forever and ever.
JER.7.8	“Behold, you are trusting in deceptive 
JER.7.9	Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear [oaths] falsely, offer sacrifices 
JER.7.10	and [then dare to] come and stand before Me in this house, which is called by My 
JER.7.11	Has this house, which is called by My Name, become a den of robbers in your eyes [a place of retreat for you between acts of violence]? Behold, I Myself have seen it,” says the L
JER.7.12	“But go now to My place which was in Shiloh [in Ephraim], where I first set My Name, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of My people Israel. 
JER.7.13	And now, because you have done all these things,” says the L
JER.7.14	therefore, I will do to this house (the temple) which is called by My Name, in which you trust, and to the place which I gave you and your fathers, just as I did to Shiloh. 
JER.7.15	I will cast you out of My sight, as I have cast out all your brothers (relatives through Jacob), all the descendants of Ephraim.
JER.7.16	“Therefore, do not pray for this people [of Judah] or lift up a cry or entreaty for them or make intercession to Me, for I do not hear you. 
JER.7.17	Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.7.18	The children gather wood, the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough to make cakes for the 
JER.7.19	Do they offend 
JER.7.20	Therefore thus says the Lord G
JER.7.21	Thus says the L
JER.7.22	For in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak to your fathers or command them concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices. 
JER.7.23	But this thing I did command them: ‘Listen to 
JER.7.24	But they did not obey Me or bend their ear [to hear Me], but followed the counsels and the stubbornness of their [own] evil heart (mind), and [they turned and] went backward instead of forward. 
JER.7.25	Since the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have [persistently] sent you all My servants the prophets, sending them daily, early [and late]. 
JER.7.26	Yet they did not listen to Me 
JER.7.27	“You shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you; and you shall [also] call to them, but they will not answer you. 
JER.7.28	You shall say to them, ‘This is the nation that did not obey the voice of the L
JER.7.29	Cut off your hair [your crown, O Jerusalem] and throw it away,
JER.7.29	And take up a mournful cry on the barren heights,
JER.7.29	For the L
JER.7.29	The generation of His wrath.’
JER.7.30	For the children of Judah have done evil in My sight,” says the L
JER.7.31	They have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the Valley of Ben-hinnom (son of Hinnom), to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire [to honor Molech, the fire god]—which I did not command, nor did it come into My heart (mind).
JER.7.32	“Therefore, behold, the days are coming,” declares the L
JER.7.33	And the dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the air and for the beasts of the earth and no one will frighten them away. 
JER.7.34	Then I will cause the voices of joy and gladness, and the voices of the bridegroom and the bride to vanish from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem; for the land will become a ruin—a wasteland.
JER.8.1	“At that time,” says the L
JER.8.2	They will [carelessly scatter and] spread them out before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven, which the dead have loved and which they have served, and which they have walked after and which they have sought, and which they have worshiped. They will not be gathered or be buried; they will be like 
JER.8.3	And death will be chosen rather than life by all the remnant of those who remain of this evil family (nation), who remain in all the places to which I have driven them,” says the L
JER.8.4	“Moreover [Jeremiah], you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the L
JER.8.4	“Do men fall and not rise up again?
JER.8.4	Does one turn away [from God] and not repent 
JER.8.5	Why then has this people of Jerusalem
JER.8.5	Turned away with a perpetual turning away [from Me]?
JER.8.5	They hold tightly to 
JER.8.5	They refuse to repent 
JER.8.6	I have listened and heard,
JER.8.6	But they have spoken what is not right;
JER.8.6	No man repented of his wickedness,
JER.8.6	Saying, ‘What have I done?’
JER.8.6	Everyone turns to his [individual] course,
JER.8.6	As the horse rushes like a torrent into battle.
JER.8.7	Even the stork in the sky
JER.8.7	Knows her seasons [of migration],
JER.8.7	And the turtledove, the swallow and the crane

JER.8.9	The wise men are shamed,

JER.8.9	Behold, they have [manipulated and] rejected the [truth in the] word of the L
JER.8.9	And what kind of wisdom 
JER.8.10	Therefore I will give their wives to others
JER.8.10	And their fields to new owners;
JER.8.10	Because from the least even to the greatest
JER.8.10	Everyone is greedy for [unjust] gain;
JER.8.10	From the prophet even to the priest
JER.8.10	Everyone practices deceit 
JER.8.11	For they have treated the brokenness of the daughter of My people superficially,
JER.8.11	Saying, ‘Peace, peace,’
JER.8.11	When there is no peace.
JER.8.12	Were they ashamed because of the extremely disgusting

JER.8.12	And they did not know how to blush.
JER.8.12	Therefore, they shall fall among those who fall;

JER.8.14	Why are we sitting still [the people wonder]?
JER.8.14	Assemble yourselves, and let us enter the fortified cities
JER.8.14	And let us die there,

JER.8.16	At the sound of the neighing of his strong stallions
JER.8.16	The whole land quakes;
JER.8.16	For they come and devour the land and all that is in it,
JER.8.16	The city and those who live in it.

JER.8.20	But we are not saved,” [comes the voice of the people again].
JER.8.21	For the brokenness of the daughter of my people I (Jeremiah) am broken;
JER.8.21	I mourn, anxiety has gripped me.
JER.8.22	Is there no balm in 
JER.8.22	Is there no physician there?
JER.8.22	Why then has not the [spiritual] health of the daughter of my people been restored?

JER.9.1	That I might weep day and night
JER.9.1	For the slain of the daughter of my people!

JER.9.17	Send for the wailing women to come.
JER.9.18	Let them hurry and take up a wailing for us,
JER.9.18	That our eyes may shed tears

JER.9.19	Because we have left the land,
JER.9.19	Because they have torn down our dwellings.’ ”
JER.9.20	Now hear the word of the L

JER.9.20	Teach your daughters a song of mourning,
JER.9.20	And each one [teach] her neighbor a dirge.
JER.9.21	For death has come up through our windows;
JER.9.21	It has entered our palaces,

JER.9.25	“Behold, the days are coming,” says the L
JER.9.26	Egypt and Judah, and Edom and the sons of Ammon, and Moab and all those who live in the desert who clip off the hair on their temples; for all these nations are uncircumcised (sinful, impure), and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.”
JER.10.1	Hear the word which the L
JER.10.2	Thus says the L
JER.10.2	“Do not learn the way of the [pagan] nations,
JER.10.2	And do not be terrified 
JER.10.2	Although the pagans are terrified by them;
JER.10.3	For the customs 
JER.10.3	It is only wood which one cuts from the forest [to make a god],
JER.10.3	The work of the hands of the craftsman with the axe 
JER.10.4	They adorn the idol with silver and with gold;
JER.10.4	They fasten it with hammers and nails
JER.10.4	So that it will not fall apart.
JER.10.5	They are like scarecrows in a cucumber field;
JER.10.5	They cannot speak;
JER.10.5	They have to be carried,
JER.10.5	Because they cannot walk!
JER.10.5	Do not be afraid of them,
JER.10.5	For they can do no harm 
JER.10.5	Nor can they do any good.”
JER.10.6	There is none like You, O L
JER.10.6	You are great, and great is Your mighty 
JER.10.7	Who would not fear You, O King of the nations?
JER.10.7	For it is appropriate 
JER.10.7	For among all the wise men of the nations
JER.10.7	And in all their kingdoms,
JER.10.7	There is none like You.
JER.10.8	But they are altogether irrational 
JER.10.9	Silver 
JER.10.9	And gold from 
JER.10.9	The work of the craftsman and of the hand of the goldsmith;
JER.10.9	Violet and purple are their clothing;
JER.10.9	They are all the work of skilled men.
JER.10.10	But the L
JER.10.10	He is the living God and the everlasting King.
JER.10.10	The earth quakes 
JER.10.10	And the nations are not able to endure His indignation.
JER.10.11	In this manner you shall say to them, “The gods that did not make the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth and from under the heavens.”
JER.10.12	God made the earth by His power;
JER.10.12	He established the world by His wisdom
JER.10.12	And by His understanding 
JER.10.13	When He utters His voice, 
JER.10.13	And He causes the clouds 
JER.10.13	He makes lightning for the rain,
JER.10.13	And brings out the wind from His treasuries 
JER.10.14	Every man has become [like a brute] irrational 
JER.10.14	Every goldsmith is shamed by his carved idols;
JER.10.14	For his molten images are frauds 
JER.10.14	And there is no breath in them.
JER.10.15	They are worthless 
JER.10.15	In their time of [trial and] punishment they will perish [without hope].
JER.10.16	The Portion of Jacob [the true God on whom Israel has a claim] is not like these;
JER.10.16	For He is the Designer 
JER.10.16	And Israel is the tribe of His inheritance [and He will not fail them]—
JER.10.16	The L
JER.10.17	Gather up your bundle [of goods] from the ground,
JER.10.17	You who live under siege.
JER.10.18	For thus says the L
JER.10.18	“Behold, I am slinging out at this time the people of this land,
JER.10.18	And will cause them [great] distress,
JER.10.18	That they may find it [to be as I have said].”
JER.10.19	“Woe to me because of my [spiritual] brokenness!” [says Jeremiah, speaking for the nation.]
JER.10.19	“My wound is incurable.”
JER.10.19	But I said, “Surely this sickness 
JER.10.19	And I must bear it.”
JER.10.20	My tent is destroyed,
JER.10.20	And all my [tent] cords are broken;
JER.10.20	My children have been taken from me [as captives] and are no more.
JER.10.20	There is no one to stretch out my tent again
JER.10.20	And to set up my [tent] curtains.
JER.10.21	For the shepherds [of the people] have become [like brutes,] irrational 
JER.10.21	And have not searched for the L
JER.10.21	Therefore they have not been wise 
JER.10.21	And all their flocks are scattered.
JER.10.22	The sound of a report! Behold, [the invader] comes—
JER.10.22	A great commotion from the country of the north (Babylonia)—
JER.10.22	To make the cities of Judah
JER.10.22	A desolation, a haunt 
JER.10.23	O L
JER.10.23	It is not within [the limited ability of] man [even one at his best] to choose 
JER.10.24	O L
JER.10.24	Not in Your anger, or You will crush me 
JER.10.25	Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not know 
JER.10.25	And on the families that do not call Your name.
JER.10.25	For they have devoured Jacob;
JER.10.25	They have devoured him and consumed him
JER.10.25	And made his land a desolate waste.
JER.11.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the L
JER.11.2	“Hear the words of this [solemn] covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and to the people of Jerusalem. 
JER.11.3	Say to them, ‘Thus says the L
JER.11.4	which I commanded your fathers at the time that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, ‘Listen to My voice and do according to all that I command you. So you shall be My people, and I will be your God,’ 
JER.11.5	that I may complete the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land [of plenty] 
JER.11.6	And the L
JER.11.7	For I solemnly warned your fathers at the time that I brought them up from the land of Egypt, even to this day, warning them persistently, saying, “Obey My voice.” 
JER.11.8	Yet they did not obey or incline their ear [to listen to Me], but everyone walked in the stubborn way of his [own] evil heart. Therefore I brought on them all [the suffering threatened in] the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did not.’ ”
JER.11.9	Then the L
JER.11.10	They have returned to the wickedness of their ancestors who refused to hear My words; they have followed other gods [in order] to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My [solemn] covenant which I made with their fathers.” 
JER.11.11	Therefore thus says the L
JER.11.12	Then the cities of Judah and the people of Jerusalem will go and cry to the [man-made] gods to whom they burn incense, but they cannot save them in the time of their disaster. 
JER.11.13	For [as many as] the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah; and [as many as] the number of the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to the shameful thing, altars to burn incense to Baal.
JER.11.14	“Therefore do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry or prayer for them, for I shall not listen when they cry to Me in the time of their disaster.
JER.11.15	What right has My beloved [to be] in My house
JER.11.15	When she has done many vile things 
JER.11.15	Can vows 
JER.11.15	So that you can [escape your judgment and] rejoice?”
JER.11.16	The L
JER.11.16	“A green olive tree, fair 
JER.11.16	But with the roar of a great tempest
JER.11.16	He has set fire to it,
JER.11.16	And its branches are worthless.

JER.11.18	Then the L
JER.11.18	So You [O L

JER.11.19	Let us cut him off from the land of the living,
JER.11.19	That his name be remembered no longer.”
JER.11.20	But, O L
JER.11.20	Who tests the feelings and the heart (mind),
JER.11.20	Let me see Your vengeance on them,
JER.11.20	For to You I have committed my cause.
JER.11.21	Therefore thus says the L
JER.11.22	Therefore, thus says the L
JER.11.23	and there will be no remnant [of the conspirators] left, for I will bring disaster 
JER.12.1	You, O L
JER.12.1	Yet let me discuss issues of justice with You:
JER.12.1	Why has the way of the wicked prospered?
JER.12.1	Why are those who deal in treachery (deceit) at ease 
JER.12.2	You have planted them, they have also taken root;
JER.12.2	They grow, they have even produced fruit.
JER.12.2	You are 
JER.12.2	But [You are] far from their heart 
JER.12.3	But You, O L
JER.12.3	You see me;
JER.12.3	And You examine 
JER.12.3	Drag out the faithless like sheep for the slaughter [O L
JER.12.3	And set them apart for the day of slaughter.
JER.12.4	How long must the land mourn
JER.12.4	And the grass of the countryside wither?
JER.12.4	Because of the wickedness 
JER.12.4	The beasts and the birds are consumed 
JER.12.4	Because men [mocking me] have said, “He will not [live long enough to] see [what happens at] our final end.”
JER.12.5	[The L
JER.12.5	Then how can you compete with horses?
JER.12.5	If you fall down in a land of peace [where you feel secure],
JER.12.5	Then how will you do [among the lions] in the [flooded] thicket beside the Jordan?
JER.12.6	For even your [tribal] brothers and the household of your father,
JER.12.6	Even they have dealt treacherously (unfaithfully) with you;
JER.12.6	Indeed they are [like a pack of hounds] howling after you.
JER.12.6	Do not believe them, although they may say kind words 
JER.12.7	“I have abandoned My house,
JER.12.7	I have given up My [precious] inheritance (Judah);
JER.12.7	I have given the [dearly] beloved of My life

JER.12.8	My inheritance has become to Me
JER.12.8	Like a lion in the forest;

JER.12.8	So I have come to [treat her as if I] hate her.
JER.12.9	Is My inheritance like a speckled bird of prey to Me [unlike the others]?
JER.12.9	Are the birds of prey (enemies) surrounding her on every side?
JER.12.9	Go, gather all the [wild] beasts of the field;

JER.12.10	Many shepherds (invaders) have destroyed My vineyard (Judah),
JER.12.10	They have trampled My field underfoot;

JER.12.10	A desolate wilderness.
JER.12.11	They have made it a wasteland,
JER.12.11	Desolate, it mourns before Me;
JER.12.11	The whole land has been made a wasteland,
JER.12.11	Because no man takes it to heart.

JER.16.4	“They will die of deadly diseases. They will not be mourned or buried; they will be like dung on the surface of the ground and come to an end by sword and famine, and their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the air and for the beasts of the earth.”
JER.16.5	For thus says the L
JER.16.6	Both great men and small will die in this land; they will not be buried, nor will they be lamented (mourned over with expressions of grief in death), nor will anyone cut himself or shave his head for them [in mourning]. 
JER.16.7	 will not offer food to the mourners, to comfort anyone [as they grieve] for the dead, nor give them a cup of consolation to drink for anyone’s father or mother. 
JER.16.8	And you [Jeremiah] shall not go into a house of feasting to sit with them to eat and drink.” 
JER.16.9	For thus says the L
JER.16.10	“Now when you tell these people all these words and they ask you, ‘Why has the L
JER.16.11	Then you are to say to them, ‘It is because your fathers have abandoned (rejected) Me,’ says the L
JER.16.12	and because you have done worse [things] than your fathers. Just look, every one of you walks in the stubbornness of his own evil heart, so that you do not listen [obediently] to Me. 
JER.16.13	Therefore I will hurl you out of this land [of Judah] into the land [of the Babylonians] which neither you nor your fathers have known, and there you will serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no compassion.’
JER.16.14	“Therefore behold, the days are coming,” says the L
JER.16.15	but, ‘As the L
JER.16.16	“Behold (listen carefully), I will send for many fishermen,” says the L
JER.16.17	For My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from My face, nor is their wickedness concealed from My eyes. 
JER.16.18	I will first doubly repay 
JER.16.19	[Then said Jeremiah] “O L
JER.16.19	And my Refuge in the day of distress 
JER.16.19	The nations will come to You
JER.16.19	From the ends of the earth and say,
JER.16.19	‘Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies 
JER.16.19	[Worthless] things in which there is no benefit!’
JER.16.20	Can a man make gods for himself?
JER.16.20	Such [things] are not gods!
JER.16.21	“Therefore,” [says the L
JER.16.21	This time I will make them know
JER.16.21	My power and My might;
JER.16.21	And they will know 
JER.17.1	The sin of Judah is written down with an iron stylus;
JER.17.1	With a diamond point it is engraved upon the tablet of their heart
JER.17.1	And on the horns of their altars.
JER.17.2	As they remember their children,
JER.17.2	So they 
JER.17.2	Beside green trees on the high hills.
JER.17.3	O [Jerusalem] My mountain in the countryside,
JER.17.3	I will give [to the Babylonians, as the cost of your sin] your wealth and all your treasures as plunder,
JER.17.3	And throughout your territory, your high places of sin.
JER.17.4	And you will, through your own fault, let go of your [grip on your] inheritance
JER.17.4	That I gave you;
JER.17.4	And I will make you serve your enemies
JER.17.4	In a land which you do not know;
JER.17.4	For you have kindled a fire in My anger
JER.17.4	Which will burn forever.
JER.17.5	Thus says the L
JER.17.5	“Cursed is the man who trusts in 
JER.17.5	Making [weak, faulty human] flesh his strength,
JER.17.5	And whose mind 
JER.17.6	For he will be like a shrub in the [parched] desert;
JER.17.6	And shall not see prosperity when it comes,
JER.17.6	But shall live in the rocky places of the wilderness,
JER.17.6	In an uninhabited salt land.
JER.17.7	Blessed [with spiritual security] is the man who believes 
JER.17.7	And whose hope 
JER.17.8	For he will be [nourished] like a tree planted by the waters,
JER.17.8	That spreads out its roots by the river;
JER.17.8	And will not fear the heat when it comes;
JER.17.8	But its leaves will be green 
JER.17.8	And it will not be anxious 
JER.17.8	Nor stop bearing fruit.
JER.17.9	“The heart is deceitful above all things
JER.17.9	And it is 
JER.17.9	Who can understand it fully 
JER.17.10	I, the L
JER.17.10	I test the heart,
JER.17.10	To give to each man according to his ways,
JER.17.10	According to the results of his deeds.
JER.17.11	Like the partridge that hatches eggs which she has not laid,
JER.17.11	So is he who makes a fortune in ways that are unjust.
JER.17.11	It will be lost to him before his days are over,
JER.17.11	And in the end he will be [nothing but] a fool.”
JER.17.12	A glorious throne, set on high from the beginning,
JER.17.12	Is the place of our sanctuary (the temple).
JER.17.13	O L
JER.17.13	All who abandon You will be shamed.
JER.17.13	Those who turn away on earth will be written down,
JER.17.13	Because they have abandoned the L
JER.17.14	Heal me, O L
JER.17.14	Save me and I will be saved,
JER.17.14	For You are my praise.
JER.17.15	Behold, they keep saying to me,
JER.17.15	“Where is the word of the L
JER.17.15	Let it come now!”
JER.17.16	But as for me, I have not tried to escape from being a shepherd [walking] after You,
JER.17.16	Nor have I longed for the woeful day [of judgment];
JER.17.16	You know that, whatever I said
JER.17.16	Was [spoken] in Your presence 
JER.17.17	Do not be a terror to me;
JER.17.17	You are my refuge 
JER.17.18	Let those who persecute me be shamed, but as for me, protect me from shame;
JER.17.18	Let them lose courage, but let me be undaunted.
JER.17.18	Bring on them a day of tragedy,
JER.17.18	And destroy them with double destruction!
JER.17.19	Thus the L
JER.17.20	and say to them, ‘Listen to the word of the L
JER.17.21	Thus says the L
JER.17.22	You shall not carry a load out of your houses on the Sabbath day nor do any work, but keep the Sabbath day holy [by setting it apart as a day of worship], as I commanded your fathers. 
JER.17.23	Yet they would not listen 
JER.17.24	But it will come about, if you listen diligently to Me,” says the L
JER.17.25	then kings and princes who will sit on the throne of David will enter through the gates of this city, riding in chariots and on horses—the kings and their princes, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city will be inhabited 
JER.17.26	People will come from the cities of Judah and the places all around Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, from the lowland, from the hill country and from the South (the Negev), bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings and incense, and bringing sacrifices of thanksgiving to the house of the L
JER.17.27	But if you will not listen to Me and keep the Sabbath day holy by not carrying a load as you come in the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in her gates that cannot be extinguished, and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem.” ’ ”
JER.18.1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the L
JER.18.2	“Arise and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will make you hear My words.” 
JER.18.3	Then I went down to the potter’s house, and saw that he was working at the wheel. 
JER.18.4	But the vessel that he was making from clay was spoiled by the potter’s hand; so he made it over, reworking it and making it into another pot that seemed good to him.
JER.18.5	Then the word of the L
JER.18.6	“O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter does?” says the L
JER.18.7	At one moment I might [suddenly] speak concerning a nation or kingdom, that I will uproot and break down and destroy; 
JER.18.8	if that nation against which I have spoken turns from its evil, I will 
JER.18.9	Or at another time I might [suddenly] speak about a nation or kingdom that I will build up or establish; 
JER.18.10	and if they do evil in My sight by not obeying My voice, then I will reverse My decision concerning the good with which I had promised to bless them. 
JER.18.11	Now then, say to the men of Judah and to the citizens of Jerusalem, ‘Thus says the L
JER.18.12	But they will say, ‘That is hopeless! For we are going to follow our own plans, and each of us will act in accordance with the stubbornness of his evil heart.’
JER.18.13	“Therefore thus says the L
JER.18.13	‘Ask now among the nations,
JER.18.13	Who has heard of such things?
JER.18.13	The virgin Israel
JER.18.13	Has done a very vile 
JER.18.14	Will the snow of [Mount] Lebanon melt 
JER.18.14	Will the cold, rushing waters of foreign 
JER.18.15	Yet My people have forgotten Me;
JER.18.15	They burn incense to worthless gods,
JER.18.15	They have stumbled from their ways
JER.18.15	From the ancient roads,
JER.18.15	To walk in pathways,
JER.18.15	Not on a highway,
JER.18.16	Making their land a desolation 
JER.18.16	Everyone who passes by will be astounded
JER.18.16	And shake his head [in scorn].
JER.18.17	I will scatter them like an east wind
JER.18.17	Before the enemy;
JER.18.17	I will show them My back and not My face
JER.18.17	In the day of their disaster [says the L
JER.18.18	Then [my enemies] said, “Come and let us work out schemes against Jeremiah. Surely the law is not going to be lost to the priest [as Jeremiah predicts], nor the counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come and let us strike him with our tongue [by making charges against him before the king], and let us ignore anything he says.”
JER.18.19	Pay attention to me, O L
JER.18.19	Listen to what my adversaries are saying [and are plotting against me]—
JER.18.20	Should good be repaid with evil?
JER.18.20	Yet they have dug a pit for me.
JER.18.20	Remember [with compassion] that I stood before You
JER.18.20	To speak good on their behalf,
JER.18.20	To turn Your anger away from them.
JER.18.21	Therefore, give their children over to the famine;
JER.18.21	Give them over to the power of the sword.
JER.18.21	And let their wives become childless and widowed;
JER.18.21	Let their men meet death [by virulent disease],
JER.18.21	Their young men be struck down by the sword in battle.
JER.18.22	Let an outcry be heard from their houses
JER.18.22	When You suddenly bring [a troop of] raiders upon them,
JER.18.22	For they have dug a pit to capture me
JER.18.22	And have hidden snares for my feet.
JER.18.23	Yet You, O L
JER.18.23	All their deadly plotting against me;
JER.18.23	Do not forgive their wickedness
JER.18.23	Or blot out their sin from Your sight.
JER.18.23	But let them be overthrown before You;
JER.18.23	Deal with them in the time of Your anger.
JER.19.1	Thus says the L
JER.19.2	and go out to the Valley of Ben-hinnom (son of Hinnom), which is near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate; and proclaim there the words that I tell you, 
JER.19.3	and say, ‘Hear the word of the L
JER.19.4	Because the people [of Jerusalem] have abandoned (rejected) Me and have made this an alien 
JER.19.5	and have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, which I never commanded or spoke of, nor did it ever enter My mind (heart); 
JER.19.6	therefore, listen very closely, the days are coming,” says the L
JER.19.7	I will pour out 
JER.19.8	I will make this city a desolation and an 
JER.19.9	And I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and their daughters, and each one will eat one another’s flesh during the siege and distress brought by their enemies and those who seek their lives.” ’
JER.19.10	“Then you are to break the jar in the sight of the men who accompany you, 
JER.19.11	and say to them, ‘Thus says the L
JER.19.12	This I will do to this place,” says the L
JER.19.13	The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be defiled like this place, Topheth, all the houses on whose rooftops incense has been burned to all the host of heaven (sun, moon, stars), and where drink offerings have been poured out to other gods.” ’ ”
JER.19.14	Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where the L
JER.19.15	“Thus says the L
JER.20.1	Now Pashhur the son of Immer, the priest, who was [also] chief officer in the house of the L
JER.20.2	Then Pashhur beat Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were at the upper Benjamin Gate by the house of the L
JER.20.3	And the next day Pashhur brought Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, “The L
JER.20.4	For thus says the L
JER.20.5	Moreover, I will hand over all the riches of this city, all the result of its labor, all its precious things; even all the treasures of the kings of Judah I will hand over to their enemies, and they will plunder them, and take them away and carry them to Babylon. 
JER.20.6	And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house will go into captivity; you will go to Babylon, and there you will die and be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have falsely prophesied.’ ”
JER.20.7	[Jeremiah said,] O L
JER.20.7	You are stronger than I and You have prevailed.
JER.20.7	I am a laughingstock all day long;
JER.20.7	Everyone mocks me.
JER.20.8	For whenever I speak, I must shout out;
JER.20.8	I shout violence and destruction,
JER.20.8	Because the word of the L
JER.20.8	A reprimand and a mockery 
JER.20.9	If I say, “I will not remember Him
JER.20.9	Or speak His name anymore,”
JER.20.9	Then my heart becomes a burning fire
JER.20.9	Shut up in my bones.
JER.20.9	And I am weary of enduring 
JER.20.9	I cannot endure it [nor contain it any longer].
JER.20.10	For I have heard the whispering 
JER.20.10	“Terror on every side!
JER.20.10	Denounce him! Let us denounce him!”
JER.20.10	All my familiar 
JER.20.10	[Those who are] watching for my fall, say,
JER.20.10	“Perhaps he will be persuaded 
JER.20.10	And take our revenge on him.”
JER.20.11	But the L
JER.20.11	Therefore my persecutors will stumble and not overcome [me].
JER.20.11	They will be completely shamed, for they have not acted wisely 
JER.20.11	Their eternal dishonor will never be forgotten.
JER.20.12	But, O L
JER.20.12	Who see the heart and the mind,
JER.20.12	Let me see Your vengeance on them;
JER.20.12	For to You I have committed my cause.
JER.20.13	Sing to the L
JER.20.13	For He has rescued the life of the needy one
JER.20.13	From the hand of evildoers.
JER.20.14	Cursed be the day on which I was born;
JER.20.14	Do not bless the day on which my mother gave birth to me!
JER.20.15	Cursed be the man who brought the news
JER.20.15	To my father, saying,
JER.20.15	“A son has been born to you!”
JER.20.15	Making him very glad.
JER.20.16	And let that man be like the cities
JER.20.16	Which the L
JER.20.16	Let him hear an outcry in the morning
JER.20.16	And a shout of alarm at noon;
JER.20.17	Because he did not kill me before my birth,
JER.20.17	So that my mother might have been my grave,
JER.20.17	And her womb always pregnant.
JER.20.18	Why did I come out of the womb
JER.20.18	To see trouble and sorrow,
JER.20.18	So that my days have been filled with shame?
JER.21.1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the L
JER.21.2	“Please inquire of the L
JER.21.3	Then Jeremiah said to them, “Say this to Zedekiah: 
JER.21.4	‘Thus says the L
JER.21.5	I Myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm in anger, in fury, and in great indignation 
JER.21.6	I will also strike the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; they will die of a great virulent disease. 
JER.21.7	Then afterward,” says the L
JER.21.8	“And to this people you (Jeremiah) shall also say, ‘Thus says the L
JER.21.9	He who remains in this city [of Jerusalem] will die by the sword and by famine and by virulent disease. But he who goes outside and surrenders to the

JER.21.11	“And concerning the royal house of the king of Judah [you shall say], ‘Hear the word of the L

JER.21.12	That My wrath will not roar up like fire
JER.21.12	And burn so [hotly] that none can extinguish it,
JER.21.12	Because of the evil of their deeds.
JER.21.13	“Understand this, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley,
JER.21.13	O rock of the plain,” says the L
JER.21.13	“You who say, ‘Who will come down against us?
JER.21.13	Or who will enter into our dwelling places?’
JER.21.14	But I will punish you in accordance with the [appropriate] consequences of your decisions 
JER.21.14	“I will kindle a fire in your forest,
JER.21.14	And it will devour all that is around you.” ’ ”
JER.22.1	Thus says the L
JER.22.2	‘Hear the word of the L
JER.22.3	Thus says the L
JER.22.4	For if you will indeed obey this word, then kings will enter through the gates of this palace, sitting in David’s place on his throne, riding in chariots and on horses, 
JER.22.5	But if you will not hear

JER.22.6	Or as the [plentiful] summit of Lebanon [west of the Jordan],
JER.22.6	Yet most certainly [if you will not listen to Me] I will make you a wilderness,
JER.22.6	And uninhabited cities.
JER.22.7	For I will prepare 
JER.22.7	Each with his weapons;
JER.22.7	And they will cut down your [palaces built of] choicest cedars
JER.22.7	And throw them in the fire.
JER.22.8	“Many nations will pass by this city; and each man will say to another, ‘Why has the L

JER.22.10	And see his native country [again].
JER.22.11	For thus says the L

JER.22.13	“Woe (judgment is coming) to him who builds his house by [acts of] unrighteousness
JER.22.13	And his upper chambers by injustice,
JER.22.13	Who uses his neighbor’s service without pay

JER.22.14	Who says, ‘I will build myself a spacious house
JER.22.14	With large upper rooms,
JER.22.14	And cut out its [wide] windows,
JER.22.14	And panel it with cedar and paint it vermilion.’
JER.22.15	Do you think that you become a king because you have much more cedar [in your palace than Solomon]?
JER.22.15	Did not your father [Josiah], as he ate and drank,
JER.22.15	Do just and righteous acts [being upright and in right standing with God]?
JER.22.15	Then all was well with him.
JER.22.16	He defended the cause of the afflicted and needy;

JER.22.16	Is that not what it means to know Me?”
JER.22.16	Says the L
JER.22.17	“But your eyes and your heart
JER.22.17	Are only intent on your own dishonest gain,
JER.22.17	On shedding innocent blood,
JER.22.17	On oppression and extortion

JER.22.18	“The relatives will not lament (mourn over with expressions of grief) for him:
JER.22.18	‘Alas, my brother!’ or, ‘Alas, sister,’ [how great our loss]!
JER.22.18	The subjects will not lament for him:

JER.22.21	This has been your attitude 
JER.22.21	You have not obeyed My voice.
JER.22.22	The wind [of adversity] will carry away all your shepherds (rulers, statesmen),
JER.22.22	And your lovers (allies) will go into exile.
JER.22.22	Surely then you will be ashamed and humiliated 
JER.22.22	Because of all your wickedness.
JER.22.23	O inhabitant of [Jerusalem, whose palaces are made from the cedars of] Lebanon,
JER.22.23	You who nest in the cedars,
JER.22.23	How you will groan 
JER.22.23	Pain like a woman in childbirth!
JER.22.24	“As I live,” says the L
JER.22.25	And I will place you in the hand of those who seek your life and in the hand of those whom you fear, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of the 
JER.22.26	I will hurl you and the mother who gave you birth into another country where you were not born, and there you will die. 
JER.22.27	But as for the land to which they long to return, they will not return to it.
JER.22.28	Is this man [King] Coniah a despised, broken jar?
JER.22.28	Is he a vessel in which no one takes pleasure?
JER.22.28	Why are he and his [royal] descendants hurled out
JER.22.28	And cast into a land which they do not know 
JER.22.29	O land, land, land,

JER.22.30	Or ruling again in Judah.’ ”
JER.23.1	“Woe to the shepherds (civil leaders, rulers) who are destroying and scattering the sheep of My pasture!” says the L
JER.23.2	Therefore thus says the L
JER.23.3	“Then I will gather the remnant of My flock out of all the countries to which I have driven them and bring them back to their folds 
JER.23.4	I will set up shepherds over them who will feed them. And they will not be afraid any longer, nor be terrified, nor will any be missing,” says the L

JER.23.9	All my bones shake;
JER.23.9	I have become like a drunken man,
JER.23.9	A man whom wine has overcome,
JER.23.9	Because of the L
JER.23.9	And because of His holy words [declared against unfaithful leaders].
JER.23.10	For the land is full of adulterers (unfaithful to God);
JER.23.10	The land mourns because of the curse [of God upon it].
JER.23.10	The pastures of the wilderness have dried up.
JER.23.10	The course of action [of the false prophets] is evil 
JER.23.10	And their power is not right.
JER.23.11	“For both [false] prophet and priest are ungodly (profane, polluted);

JER.23.13	“And I have seen a foolish

JER.23.14	They encourage 
JER.23.14	So that no one has turned back from his wickedness.
JER.23.14	All of them have become like Sodom to Me,

JER.23.15	Therefore thus says the L
JER.23.15	‘Behold, I am going to feed them [the bitterness of] wormwood
JER.23.15	And make them drink the poisonous water [of gall],
JER.23.15	For from the [counterfeit] prophets of Jerusalem
JER.23.15	Profaneness 
JER.23.16	Thus says the L
JER.23.16	“Do not listen to the words of the [false] prophets who prophesy to you.
JER.23.16	They are teaching you worthless things 
JER.23.16	They speak a vision of their own mind 
JER.23.16	And not [truth] from the mouth of the L
JER.23.17	They are continually saying to those who despise Me [and My word],
JER.23.17	‘The Lord has said, “You will have peace” ’;
JER.23.17	And they say to everyone who walks after the stubbornness of his own heart,
JER.23.17	‘No evil will come on you.’
JER.23.18	But who [among them] has stood in the council of the L
JER.23.18	That he would perceive and hear His word?
JER.23.18	Who has marked His word [noticing and observing and paying attention to it] and has [actually] heard it?
JER.23.19	Behold, the tempest of the L
JER.23.19	A whirling tempest;
JER.23.19	It will whirl 
JER.23.20	The anger of the L
JER.23.20	Until He has set in motion and accomplished the thoughts 
JER.23.20	In the last days you will clearly understand it.
JER.23.21	I did not send [these counterfeit] prophets,
JER.23.21	Yet they ran;
JER.23.21	I did not speak to them,
JER.23.21	Yet they prophesied.
JER.23.22	But if they had stood in My council,
JER.23.22	Then they would have caused My people to hear My words,
JER.23.22	Then they would have turned My people from their evil way
JER.23.22	And from the evil of their decisions 
JER.23.23	“Am I a God who is at hand,” says the L
JER.23.23	“And not a God far away?”
JER.23.24	“Can anyone hide himself in secret places
JER.23.24	So that I cannot see him?” says the L
JER.23.24	“Do I not fill heaven and earth?” says the L
JER.23.25	“I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in My Name, saying, ‘I have dreamed, I have dreamed [visions when on my bed at night].’ 
JER.23.26	How long [shall this state of affairs continue]? Is there anything in the hearts of the prophets who prophesy falsehood, even these prophets of the deception of their own heart, 
JER.23.27	who think that they can make My people forget My Name by their [contrived] dreams which each one tells another, just as their fathers forgot My Name because of Baal? 
JER.23.28	The prophet who has a dream may tell his dream; but he who has My word, let him speak My word faithfully. What has straw in common with wheat [for nourishment]?” says the L
JER.23.29	“Is not My word like fire [that consumes all that cannot endure the test]?” says the L
JER.23.30	Therefore behold (hear this), I am against the [counterfeit] prophets,” says the L
JER.23.31	Hear this, I am against the prophets,” says the L
JER.23.32	Hear this, I am against those who have prophesied false 
JER.23.33	“Now when this people or a prophet or a priest asks you [in jest], ‘What is the

JER.23.39	Therefore behold, I, even I, will assuredly forget you and send you away from My presence, you and the city (Jerusalem) which I gave to you and to your fathers. 
JER.23.40	And I will bring an everlasting disgrace on you and a perpetual humiliation (shame) which will not be forgotten.”
JER.24.1	After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken Jeconiah [who was also called Coniah and Jehoiachin] the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah [along] with the craftsmen and smiths into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon, the L
JER.24.2	One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are the first to ripen; but the other basket had very bad figs, so rotten that they could not be eaten. 
JER.24.3	Then the L
JER.24.4	Again the word of the L
JER.24.5	“Thus says the L
JER.24.6	For I will set My eyes on them for good, and I will bring them again to this land; and I will build them up and not overwhelm them, and I will plant them and not uproot them. 
JER.24.7	I will give them a heart to know Me, [understanding fully] that I am the L
JER.24.8	‘And as for the bad figs, which are so rotten that they cannot be eaten,’ surely thus says the L
JER.24.9	I will make them a focus of ridicule 
JER.24.10	I will send the sword, famine and virulent disease among them until they are consumed from the land which I gave to them and to their fathers.’ ”
JER.25.1	The word that came to Jeremiah in regard to all the people of Judah in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (that was the first year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), 
JER.25.2	which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, 
JER.25.3	“For these twenty-three years—from the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even to this day—the word of the L
JER.25.4	Although the L
JER.25.5	saying, ‘Turn now everyone from his evil way and the evil of your actions [that you may not forfeit the right to] live in the land that the L
JER.25.6	and do not go after other gods to serve them and to worship them, and do not provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands, and I will do you no harm.’ 
JER.25.7	Yet you have not listened to Me,” says the L
JER.25.8	“Therefore thus says the L
JER.25.9	behold (hear this), I will send for all the families of the north,’ says the L
JER.25.10	Moreover, I will take from them the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones [grinding meal] and the light of the lamp [to light the night]. 
JER.25.11	This whole land will be a waste and a horror, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon 
JER.25.12	‘Then when seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans (Babylonia),’ says the L
JER.25.13	I will bring on that land all My words which I have pronounced against it, all that is written in this book which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations. 
JER.25.14	(For many nations and great kings will make slaves of them, even the Chaldeans [who enslaved other nations]; and I will repay [all of] them according to their deeds and according to the work of their [own] hands.)’ ”
JER.25.15	For thus says the L
JER.25.16	They will drink and stagger and go mad because of the sword that I will send among them.”
JER.25.17	Then I (Jeremiah) took the cup from the L
JER.25.18	Jerusalem and the cities of Judah [being most guilty because their privileges were greatest], its kings and princes, to make them a horror, a ruin, a hissing and a curse, as it is to this day; 
JER.25.19	Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his princes, all his people, 
JER.25.20	and all the foreign (mixed) population, all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines (and [their cities of] Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod); 
JER.25.21	Edom, Moab, and the children of Ammon; 
JER.25.22	all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the islands 
JER.25.23	Dedan, Tema, Buz [the neighboring tribes north of Arabia], and all who clip off the side-growth 
JER.25.24	all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the foreign population who live in the desert; 
JER.25.25	all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam (Persia), and all the kings of Media; 
JER.25.26	all the kings of the north, far and near, one after another—and all the kingdoms of the world which are on the face of the earth. And the king of Sheshach (Babylon) shall drink after them.
JER.25.27	“Then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the L
JER.25.28	And if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you will say to them, ‘Thus says the L
JER.25.29	For behold, I am beginning to work disaster in the city which is called by My Name, and shall you go unpunished? You will not be exempt from punishment, for I am calling for a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth,” says the L

JER.26.21	And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put Uriah to death; but when Uriah heard of it, he was afraid and fled and escaped to Egypt. 
JER.26.22	Then Jehoiakim the king sent men to Egypt: Elnathan the son of Achbor and certain [other] men with him [went] to Egypt. 
JER.26.23	And they brought Uriah [God’s spokesman] from Egypt and led him to King Jehoiakim, who executed him with a sword and threw his dead body among the graves of the common people.
JER.26.24	But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that he was not given into the hands of the people to put him to death.
JER.27.1	In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the L

JER.34.7	when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the remaining cities of Judah, against Lachish and Azekah, for these were the [only] fortified cities among the cities of Judah.
JER.34.8	The word came to Jeremiah from the L
JER.34.9	that every man should let his Hebrew slaves, male and female, go free, so that no one should make a slave of a Jew, his brother. 
JER.34.10	So all the princes and all the people who had entered into the covenant agreed that everyone would let his male servant and his female servant go free, and that no one would keep them in bondage any longer; they obeyed, and set 
JER.34.11	But afterward they backed out [of the covenant] and made the male servants and the female servants whom they had set free return [to them], and brought the male servants and the female servants again into servitude.

JER.34.17	“Therefore says the L
JER.34.18	The men who have violated My covenant, who have not kept the terms of the solemn pledge which they made before Me when they split the [sacrificial] calf in half, and then afterwards walked between its separated pieces [sealing their pledge to Me by placing a curse on themselves should they violate the covenant—those men I will make like the calf]!

JER.34.21	Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes I will place into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their life, and into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon which has withdrawn from you.

JER.35.4	and I brought them into the house of the L
JER.35.5	Then I set before the men of the house of the Rechabites pitchers full of wine, and cups, and I said to them, “Drink wine.” 
JER.35.6	But they said, “We will not drink wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us: ‘You shall not drink wine, neither you nor your sons, forever. 
JER.35.7	Nor shall you build a house or sow seed or plant a vineyard or own one; but you shall live in tents all your days, that you may live many days in the land where you are sojourners (temporary residents).’ 
JER.35.8	We have obeyed the words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, in all our days we have never drunk wine, nor have our wives, our sons, or our daughters, 
JER.35.9	nor have we built ourselves houses to live in; nor do we have vineyards or fields or seed. 
JER.35.10	We have lived only in tents, and have obeyed and done [everything] according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us. 
JER.35.11	But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against the land, we said, ‘Come and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans [who rule Babylon] and for fear of the army of the Arameans.’ So we have lived in Jerusalem.”
JER.35.12	Then came the word of the L
JER.35.13	“Thus says the L
JER.35.14	“The command which Jonadab the son of Rechab gave to his sons not to drink wine has been observed [as a custom for more than two hundred years]. To this day they do not drink

JER.35.16	Indeed, the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have observed the command of their father which he gave them, but this people has not listened to Me.’ ” ’ 
JER.35.17	Therefore thus says the L

JER.36.3	It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the disaster which I plan to bring on them, so that each one will turn from his evil way, that I may forgive their wickedness and their sin.”
JER.36.4	Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote on the scroll of the book all the words which Jeremiah dictated, [words] which the L
JER.36.5	Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, “I am [in hiding, virtually] restrained; I cannot go into the house of the L

JER.36.10	Then Baruch read to all the people the words of Jeremiah from the scroll of the book in the house of the L
JER.36.11	When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard all the words of the L
JER.36.12	he went down to the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber; and behold, all the princes were sitting there: Elishama the scribe, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the [other] princes. 
JER.36.13	Then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read from the scroll to all the people. 
JER.36.14	Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, “Take in your hand the scroll from which you have read to the people and come [to us].” So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and went to them. 
JER.36.15	And they said to him, “Sit down now and read it to us.” So Baruch read it to them. 
JER.36.16	Now when they had heard all the words, they turned one to another in fear and said to Baruch, “We must surely report all these words to the king.” 
JER.36.17	And they asked Baruch, “Tell us now, how did you write all these words? At his (Jeremiah’s) dictation?” 
JER.36.18	Then Baruch answered them, “He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink on the scroll.” 
JER.36.19	Then the princes said to Baruch, “Go and hide, you and Jeremiah, and do not let anyone know where you are.”
JER.36.20	Then they went into the court to the king, but they [first] put the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; then they reported all the words to the king. 
JER.36.21	So the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it to the king and all the princes who stood beside the king. 
JER.36.22	Now it was the ninth month, and the king was sitting in the winter house, with 
JER.36.23	And after Jehudi had read three or four columns [of the scroll], 
JER.36.24	Yet the king and all his servants who heard all these words were not afraid, nor did they tear their clothes. 
JER.36.25	Even though Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah pleaded with the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them. 
JER.36.26	And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet, but the L
JER.36.27	Then the word of the L
JER.36.28	“Take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were on the first scroll which Jehoiakim the king of Judah burned. 
JER.36.29	And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, ‘Thus says the L
JER.36.30	Therefore thus says the L
JER.36.31	I will also punish him and his descendants and his servants for their wickedness, and I will bring on them and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the men of Judah all the destruction that I have declared against them—but they would not listen.” ’ ”
JER.36.32	Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and many similar words were added to them.
JER.37.1	Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made Zedekiah the son of Josiah king in the land of Judah so he reigned as king instead of Coniah (also called Jeconiah and Jehoiachin) the son of Jehoiakim. 
JER.37.2	But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the words of the L
JER.37.3	Yet King Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah [along] with Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, “Please pray [now] to the L
JER.37.4	Now Jeremiah was coming and going among the people, for they had not [yet] put him in prison. 
JER.37.5	Meanwhile, Pharaoh’s army had set out from Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard the news about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.
JER.37.6	Then the word of the L
JER.37.7	“Thus says the L
JER.37.8	And the Chaldeans [of Babylon] will come again and fight against this city, and they will capture it and set it on fire.” ’ 
JER.37.9	Thus says the L
JER.37.10	For even if you had defeated the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and there remained only the wounded men among them, yet they would rise up, every man confined in his tent, and burn down this city with fire.’ ”
JER.37.11	Now it happened when the army of the Chaldeans departed from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s [approaching] army, 
JER.37.12	that Jeremiah left Jerusalem [during the withdrawal of the Chaldean invaders] to go to [Anathoth, his hometown, in] the land of Benjamin to take possession of [the title to] the land [which he had purchased] there among the people. 
JER.37.13	When he was at the Gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah the son of Hananiah was there; and he seized 
JER.37.14	But Jeremiah said, “That is a lie! I am not deserting to join the Chaldeans.” But the guard would not listen to him. So Irijah took Jeremiah and brought him to the princes (court officials). 
JER.37.15	The princes were enraged with Jeremiah and beat him and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe—for they had made that the prison. 
JER.37.16	When Jeremiah had come into 
JER.37.17	Zedekiah the king sent and brought him out; and in his palace the king secretly asked him, “Is there any word from the L
JER.37.18	Moreover, Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “In what way have I sinned against you, or against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison? 
JER.37.19	Where then are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you or against this land?’ 
JER.37.20	Therefore now, please listen, O my lord the king; please let my petition come before you 
JER.37.21	Then King Zedekiah commanded, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guardhouse, and a [round] loaf of bread from the bakers’ street was given to him daily, until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained [imprisoned] in the court of the guardhouse.
JER.38.1	Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal (also called Jehucal) the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah heard the words that Jeremiah was speaking to all the people, saying, 
JER.38.2	“So says the L
JER.38.3	Thus says the L
JER.38.4	Therefore the princes (court officials) said to the king, “Please [we implore you] let this man [Jeremiah] be put to death; for [speaking] in this way he discourages 
JER.38.5	Then King Zedekiah [fearing the princes] said, “Listen, he is in your hand; for the king is in no position to do anything against you.” 
JER.38.6	So they took Jeremiah and threw him into the 
JER.38.7	Now Ebed-melech the Ethiopian (Cushite), one of the eunuchs who was in the king’s palace, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the cistern, and while the king was sitting in the Gate of Benjamin, 
JER.38.8	Ebed-melech went out of the king’s palace and spoke to the king, saying, 
JER.38.9	“My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet whom they have thrown into the cistern; and he will die [of hunger] where he is because of the famine, for there is no more bread in the city.” 
JER.38.10	Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, “Take thirty men from here with you and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.” 
JER.38.11	So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went into the palace of the king to 
JER.38.12	Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Now put these old rags and worn-out clothes under your armpits, then place the ropes under the padding”; and Jeremiah did so. 
JER.38.13	So they pulled Jeremiah up with the ropes and took him up out of the cistern; and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guardhouse.
JER.38.14	Then King Zedekiah sent and had Jeremiah the prophet brought to him at the third entrance that is in the house of the L
JER.38.15	Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I tell you, will you not certainly put me to death? Even if I do give you advice, you will not listen to me.” 
JER.38.16	But King Zedekiah swore secretly to Jeremiah, “As the L
JER.38.17	Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Thus says the L
JER.38.18	But if you will not go out to the officers of the king of Babylon, then this city will be given into the hand of the Chaldeans [of Babylon] and they will set it on fire; and you yourself will not escape from their hand.’ ” 
JER.38.19	Then King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews [my former subjects] who have deserted to join the Chaldeans, for the enemy may put me into their hand and they will mock me 
JER.38.20	But Jeremiah said, “They will not hand you over [to them]. Please obey [the voice of] the L
JER.38.21	But if you keep refusing to go out 
JER.38.22	‘Then behold, all the women who are left in the palace of the king of Judah will be brought out to the officers of the king of Babylon and those women will say [to you, King Zedekiah],
JER.38.22	“Your close friends
JER.38.22	Have prevailed against your better judgment 
JER.38.22	While your feet were sunk in the mire [of trouble],
JER.38.22	They turned back.”
JER.38.23	Also, all your wives and your children will be brought out to the Chaldeans; and you yourself will not escape from their hand, but you will be seized by the king of Babylon, and this city [Jerusalem] will be burned down with fire.’ ”
JER.38.24	Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no man know about this conversation and you will not die. 
JER.38.25	But if the princes (court officials) hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you and say, ‘Tell us now what you said to the king and what he said to you; do not hide it from us and we will not execute you,’ 
JER.38.26	then you are to say to them, ‘I was presenting my [humble] petition 
JER.38.27	Then all the princes (court officials) came to Jeremiah and asked him [just what King Zedekiah had anticipated they would ask], and he reported to them in accordance with all that the king had commanded. So they stopped questioning him, since the conversation [with the king] had not been overheard. 
JER.38.28	So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guardhouse until the day that Jerusalem was captured [by the Chaldeans of Babylon].
JER.39.1	Now regarding the capture of Jerusalem: In the ninth year of [the reign of] Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and besieged it; 
JER.39.2	and in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, they breached the wall 
JER.39.3	Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came in and sat in the Middle Gate [establishing both military control of the city and their authority to judge the captives]: Nergal-sar-ezer, Samgar-nebu, Sar-sekim the Rab-saris (chief of the eunuchs), and 
JER.39.4	When Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, they fled and escaped from the city at night by way of the king’s garden, through the gate between the two walls; and the king went out toward the Arabah (Jordan Valley). 
JER.39.5	But the Chaldean (Babylonian) army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. When they had seized him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the [Aramean] land of Hamath, where he passed sentence on him. 
JER.39.6	Then at Riblah the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes; the king of Babylon also killed all the nobles of Judah. 
JER.39.7	Moreover, he blinded Zedekiah and bound him with bronze shackles to take him to Babylon. 
JER.39.8	The Chaldeans also burned down the king’s palace and the houses of the people, and they broke down the walls of Jerusalem. 
JER.39.9	Then Nebuzaradan the [chief executioner and] captain of the bodyguard took the rest of the people who remained in the city, along with those who had deserted 
JER.39.10	But Nebuzaradan the [Babylonian] captain of the bodyguard left behind in the land of Judah some of the poor people who had nothing, and gave them vineyards and fields at that time.
JER.39.11	Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave orders concerning Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard, saying, 
JER.39.12	“Take him and look after him; do nothing to harm him, but rather deal with him just as he asks of you.” 
JER.39.13	So Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard sent 
JER.39.14	they even sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guardhouse and entrusted him to Gedaliah [a prominent citizen], the son of Ahikam [who had once saved Jeremiah’s life], the son of Shaphan, to take him home [with him to Mizpah]. So Jeremiah [was released and] lived among the people.
JER.39.15	Now the word of the L
JER.39.16	“Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, ‘Thus says the L
JER.39.17	But I will 
JER.39.18	For I will certainly rescue you; and you will not fall by the sword, but you will have your [own] life as a reward of battle, because you have placed your trust in Me,” says the L
JER.40.1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the L
JER.40.2	And the captain of the bodyguard had taken Jeremiah and said to him, “The L
JER.40.3	Now the L
JER.40.4	But now, listen carefully, [because of your innocence] I am freeing you today from the chains which are on your hands. If you would prefer to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will look after you [carefully]; but if you would prefer not to come with me to Babylon, then do not do so. Look, all the land is before you; go wherever it seems good and right (convenient) for you to go.” 
JER.40.5	While Jeremiah was still hesitating, the captain of the bodyguard said, “Go on back then to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed [governor] over the cities of Judah, and stay with him among the people; or else go wherever it seems right for you to go.” So the captain of the bodyguard gave him an allowance of food and a gift and let him go. 
JER.40.6	Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam at Mizpah and stayed with him among the people who were left in the land.
JER.40.7	Now when all the commanders of the forces that were [scattered] in the open country [of Judah] and their men heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land [of Judah] and had put him in charge of the men, women, and children, those of the poorest of the land who had not been exiled to Babylon, 
JER.40.8	they went to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men. 
JER.40.9	Then Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, swore to them and their men, saying, “Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans; stay in this land and serve the king of Babylon, that it may go well with you. 
JER.40.10	As for me, I am going to stay at Mizpah to stand [for you] before the Chaldeans who come to us [ministering to them and looking after the king’s interests]; but as for you, gather in wine, summer fruit and oil and store them in your utensils [designed for such purposes], and live in your cities that you have taken over.” 
JER.40.11	Likewise, when all the Jews who were in Moab and among the people of Ammon and in Edom and who were in all the [other] countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant [of the people] in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan over them [as governor], 
JER.40.12	then all the Jews returned from all the places to which they had been driven and came back to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered a great abundance of wine and summer fruits.
JER.40.13	Moreover, Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were [scattered] in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah 
JER.40.14	and said to him, “Do you know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam did not believe them. 
JER.40.15	Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah in Mizpah, saying, “Let me go and kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and not a man will know [who is responsible]. Why should he kill you and cause all the Jews who are gathered near you to be scattered and the remnant of Judah to perish?” 
JER.40.16	But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “Do not do this thing, for you are lying about Ishmael.”
JER.41.1	Now in the 
JER.41.2	Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him got up and struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword and killed the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed [governor] over the land. 
JER.41.3	Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were [at the banquet] with Gedaliah at Mizpah, in addition to the Chaldean soldiers who were there.
JER.41.4	Now it happened on the second day after the killing of Gedaliah, before anyone knew about it, 
JER.41.5	that eighty men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria with their beards shaved off and their clothes torn and their bodies cut, carrying in their hands grain offerings and incense to present at the [site of the] house of the L
JER.41.6	Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping [false tears] as he went. As he met them, he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam!” 
JER.41.7	Yet when they came into the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men who were with him slaughtered them 
JER.41.8	But ten men who were among them said to Ishmael, “Do not kill us! We have stores of wheat and barley and oil and honey hidden in the field.” So he stopped and did not kill them along with their companions.
JER.41.9	Now the cistern into which Ishmael had thrown all the corpses of the men whom he had killed along with Gedaliah was the one which King Asa [of Judah] had made [about three hundred years earlier] on account of King Baasha of Israel [believing that Baasha would lay siege to Mizpah]. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with [the bodies of] those who were killed. 
JER.41.10	Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah—even the king’s daughters (ladies of the court) and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard had put under the charge of Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and crossed over [the Jordan] to [meet his allies] the Ammonites.
JER.41.11	But when Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him heard of the murderous behavior of Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, 
JER.41.12	they took all their men and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and found him by the great pool in Gibeon. 
JER.41.13	Now when all the [captive] people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him, they were glad. 
JER.41.14	So all the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and joined Johanan the son of Kareah. 
JER.41.15	But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to join the Ammonites. 
JER.41.16	Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him took from Mizpah all the people whom he had rescued from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, after Ishmael had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: the soldiers, the women, the children, and the high officials whom Johanan had brought back from Gibeon. 
JER.41.17	And they went and stayed in Geruth [the lodging place of] Chimham, which is near Bethlehem, intending to go to Egypt 
JER.41.18	because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed [governor] over the land [and whose death the king might avenge].
JER.42.1	Then all the commanders of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah and Jezaniah (Azariah) the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest approached 
JER.42.2	and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “Please let our petition be presented before you, and pray to the L
JER.42.3	that the L
JER.42.4	Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard you. Now hear me, I will pray to the L
JER.42.5	Then they said to Jeremiah, “May the L
JER.42.6	Whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, we will listen to 
JER.42.7	Now after ten days [of prayer] had passed the word of the L
JER.42.8	Then he called for Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him and all the people from the least to the greatest, 
JER.42.9	and said to them, “Thus says the L
JER.42.10	‘If you will indeed remain in this land, then I will build you up and not tear you down, and I will plant you and not uproot you; for I will relent 
JER.42.11	Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you now fear [as if he were deity]; do not be afraid of him,’ says the L
JER.42.12	And I will show you compassion, so that he will have compassion on you and restore you to your own land. 
JER.42.13	But if you are going to say, “We will not stay in this land,” and [in so doing] do not listen to the voice of the L
JER.42.14	saying, “No, but we will go to the land of Egypt, where we will not see war or hear the sound of the [warrior’s] trumpet or hunger for bread, and we will stay there,” 
JER.42.15	then in that case listen to the word of the L
JER.42.16	then the sword, of which you are afraid, will overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine of which you are afraid will follow closely after you in Egypt, and you will die there. 
JER.42.17	So all the men who set their mind to go to Egypt to reside there [temporarily] will die by the sword, by famine and by virulent disease; none of them will remain or survive the disaster that I am going to bring on them.” ’ ”
JER.42.18	For thus says the L
JER.42.19	The L
JER.42.20	that you have deceived yourselves; for you sent me to the L
JER.42.21	And so I have told you today, but you have not listened to the voice of the L
JER.42.22	Now therefore know for certain that you will die by the sword, by famine, and by virulent disease in the land [of Egypt] where you wish to reside [temporarily].
JER.43.1	Now it happened when Jeremiah, whom the L
JER.43.2	Azariah the son of Hoshaiah and Johanan the son of Kareah and all the proud 
JER.43.3	But Baruch the son of Neriah is inciting you against us to hand us over to the Chaldeans, so they may [either] put us to death or exile us to Babylon.” 
JER.43.4	So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces and all the people disobeyed the voice of the L
JER.43.5	But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took all the remnant of Judah who had returned to live in the land of Judah from all the nations to which they had been driven— 
JER.43.6	the men, women, and children, the king’s daughters (ladies of the court), and every person whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; he also took Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah. 
JER.43.7	So they entered the land of Egypt (for they did not obey the voice of the L
JER.43.8	Then came the word of the L
JER.43.9	“Take some large stones in your hands and hide them in the mortar in the brickwork [of the terrace] which is at the entrance of Pharaoh’s 
JER.43.10	and say to them, ‘Thus says the L
JER.43.11	He will also come and 
JER.43.12	And [through him] I will set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt, and he will burn them and take them (Egyptian idols) captive. He will wrap himself with the land of Egypt as a shepherd wraps himself with his garment, and he will go away from there safely. 
JER.43.13	Nebuchadnezzar will also break the images 
JER.44.1	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who were living in the land of Egypt—at Migdol, at Tahpanhes, at Memphis, and in the land of Pathros, saying, 
JER.44.2	“Thus says the L
JER.44.3	because of the wickedness which they committed, provoking Me to anger by continuing to burn sacrifices 
JER.44.4	Yet I sent to you all My servants the prophets, again and again, saying, “Oh, do not do this shamefully vile thing which I hate.” 
JER.44.5	But they did not listen or turn [obediently] from their wickedness, and stop burning sacrifices 
JER.44.6	Therefore My wrath and My anger were poured out and burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; so they have become a ruin and a desolation, as it is this day. 
JER.44.7	Therefore now thus says the L
JER.44.8	Why do you [deliberately] provoke Me to anger with the works (idols) of your hands, burning sacrifices 
JER.44.9	Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, the wickedness of the kings of Judah, the wickedness of their wives [who served their foreign gods], your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives [who imitated the sin of the queens], which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.44.10	They have not become apologetic [for their guilt and sin] even to this day; they have not feared [Me with reverence] nor walked in My law or My statutes, which I have set before you and before your fathers.” ’
JER.44.11	“Therefore thus says the L
JER.44.12	And I will take the remnant of Judah who have decided to go into the land of Egypt to live there [instead of surrendering to the Chaldeans as directed], and they will all fall and die in the land of Egypt; they will fall by the sword or perish by famine. From the least to the greatest, they will die by the sword or by famine; and they will become detestable, an object of horror, a curse, and a disgrace. 
JER.44.13	For I will punish all the inhabitants of the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with famine, and with virulent disease; 
JER.44.14	so none of the survivors from the remnant of Judah who have entered the land of Egypt to live there will survive, even though they lift up their souls in longing to return to the land of Judah, [the place] to which they long to return to live; none will return except a few refugees.’ ”
JER.44.15	Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning 
JER.44.16	“As for the word (message) that you have spoken to us in the name of the L
JER.44.17	But rather we will certainly perform every word of the vows we have made: to burn sacrifices to the 
JER.44.18	But since we stopped burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have been consumed by the sword and by famine.” 
JER.44.19	 “When we were burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and were pouring out drink offerings to her, was it without [the knowledge and approval of] our husbands that we made cakes [in the shape of a star] to represent her and pour out drink offerings to her?”
JER.44.20	Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men and to the women and to all the people who had given him that answer, 
JER.44.21	“The smoking sacrifices (incense) that you burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem—you and your forefathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land—did not the L
JER.44.22	The L
JER.44.23	Because you have burned sacrifices [to idols] and because you have sinned against the L
JER.44.24	Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, “Hear the word of the L
JER.44.25	thus says the L
JER.44.26	Therefore hear the word of the L
JER.44.27	Behold, I am watching over them for harm and not for good; and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by famine until they are all destroyed. 
JER.44.28	Yet a small number [of My choosing] who escape the sword will return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah; and all the remnant of Judah who have gone to the land of Egypt to reside there will know whose words will stand, Mine or theirs. 
JER.44.29	And this will be the sign to you,’ says the L
JER.44.30	Thus says the L
JER.45.1	The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to 
JER.45.2	“Thus says the L
JER.45.3	‘You said, “Woe is me! For the L

JER.46.1	The word of the L

JER.46.5	Why have I seen it?
JER.46.5	They are terrified
JER.46.5	And have turned back,
JER.46.5	And their warriors are beaten down.
JER.46.5	They take flight in haste
JER.46.5	Without looking back;

JER.46.5	Says the L

JER.46.6	In the north by the river Euphrates
JER.46.6	They have stumbled and fallen.

JER.46.7	Like the rivers [in the delta of Egypt] whose waters surge about?
JER.46.8	Egypt rises like the Nile,

JER.46.8	I will certainly destroy the city and its inhabitants.”
JER.46.9	Charge, you horses,
JER.46.9	And drive like madmen, you chariots!
JER.46.9	Let the warriors go forward:
JER.46.9	Ethiopia and Put (Libya) who handle the shield,
JER.46.9	And the Lydians who handle and bend the bow.
JER.46.10	For that day belongs to the Lord G
JER.46.10	A day of vengeance, that He may avenge Himself on His adversaries.
JER.46.10	And the sword will devour and be satiated

JER.46.11	In vain you use many medicines;
JER.46.11	For you there is no healing 
JER.46.12	The nations have heard of your disgrace 
JER.46.12	And your cry [of distress] has filled the earth.
JER.46.12	For warrior has stumbled against warrior,
JER.46.12	And both of them have fallen together.
JER.46.13	The word that the L
JER.46.14	“Declare in Egypt and proclaim in 
JER.46.14	And proclaim in 
JER.46.14	Say, ‘Take your stand and get yourself ready,

JER.46.15	They do not stand because the L

JER.46.16	Yes, they have fallen one on another.
JER.46.16	Then they said, ‘Arise, and let us go back
JER.46.16	To our own people and to the land of our birth,
JER.46.16	Away from the sword of the oppressor.’
JER.46.17	They cried there, ‘Pharaoh king of Egypt is destroyed 
JER.46.17	He has let the appointed time [of opportunity] pass by!’
JER.46.18	As I live,” says the King,

JER.46.21	Are like fattened calves,
JER.46.21	For they too have turned back and have fled together;
JER.46.21	They did not stand [their ground],
JER.46.21	Because the day of their disaster has come upon them,
JER.46.21	The time of their punishment.
JER.46.22	The sound [of Egypt fleeing from the enemy] is like [the rustling of] an escaping serpent,
JER.46.22	For her foes advance with a mighty army
JER.46.22	And come against her like woodcutters with axes.
JER.46.23	They have cut down her forest,” says the L
JER.46.23	“Certainly it will no longer be found,
JER.46.23	Because they (the invaders) are more numerous than locusts
JER.46.23	And cannot be counted.
JER.46.24	The Daughter of Egypt has been shamed,
JER.46.24	Given over to the power of the people of the north [the Chaldeans of Babylonia].”

JER.46.28	Do not fear, O Jacob My servant,” says the L
JER.46.28	“For I am with you.
JER.46.28	For I will make a full

JER.47.1	The word of the L
JER.47.2	Thus says the L
JER.47.2	“Behold, waters are going to rise out of the north (Babylonia)
JER.47.2	And become an overflowing stream
JER.47.2	And overflow the land and all that is in it,
JER.47.2	The city and those who live in it.
JER.47.2	Then the people will cry out,
JER.47.2	And all the inhabitants of the land [of Philistia] will wail.
JER.47.3	Because of the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of the war-horses [of the Babylonian king],
JER.47.3	The rattling of his chariots, and the rumbling of his wheels,
JER.47.3	The fathers have not looked 
JER.47.3	So weak are their hands [with terror]
JER.47.4	Because of the day that is coming
JER.47.4	To destroy all the Philistines
JER.47.4	And to cut off from Tyre and Sidon
JER.47.4	Every ally who remains.
JER.47.4	For the L
JER.47.4	The remnant [still surviving] of the coastland of 
JER.47.5	Baldness [as a sign of mourning] will come on Gaza;
JER.47.5	Ashkelon will be cut off 
JER.47.5	O remnant of their valley,
JER.47.5	How long will you gash yourselves [as a sign of mourning]?
JER.47.6	O you sword of the L
JER.47.6	How long will it be before you are quiet?

JER.47.7	How can His sword be quiet
JER.47.7	When the L
JER.47.7	Against Ashkelon and against the [whole Philistine] seashore
JER.47.7	There He has assigned it.”
JER.48.1	Concerning 
JER.48.1	Thus says the L
JER.48.1	“Woe (judgment is coming) to [the city of] 
JER.48.1	Kiriathaim has been shamed, it has been captured;
JER.48.1	Misgab [the high fortress] has been shamed, broken down 
JER.48.2	The glory of Moab is no more;
JER.48.2	In 
JER.48.2	Saying, ‘Come, let us cut her off from being a nation!’
JER.48.2	You also, O [city of] Madmen, shall be silenced;
JER.48.2	The sword will pursue you.
JER.48.3	The sound of an outcry from Horonaim,
JER.48.3	‘Desolation and great destruction!’
JER.48.4	Moab is destroyed;
JER.48.4	Her little ones have called out a cry 
JER.48.5	For the Ascent of Luhith
JER.48.5	Will be climbed by [successive groups of] fugitives with continual weeping;
JER.48.5	For on the descent of Horonaim
JER.48.5	They have heard the distress of the cry of destruction.
JER.48.6	Run! Save your lives,
JER.48.6	That you may be like a juniper in the wilderness.
JER.48.7	For because you have trusted in your works [your hand-made idols] and in your treasures [instead of in God],
JER.48.7	Even you yourself will be captured;
JER.48.7	And 
JER.48.7	Together with his priests and his princes.
JER.48.8	And the destroyer will come upon every city;
JER.48.8	No city will escape.
JER.48.8	The [Jordan] valley also will be ruined
JER.48.8	And the plain will be devastated,
JER.48.8	As the L
JER.48.9	Give a gravestone to Moab,
JER.48.9	For she will fall into ruins;
JER.48.9	Her cities (pastures, farms) will be desolate,
JER.48.9	Without anyone to live in them.
JER.48.10	Cursed is the one who does the work of the L
JER.48.10	And cursed is the one who restrains his sword from blood [in executing the judgment of the L
JER.48.11	“Moab has been at ease from his youth;
JER.48.11	He has also been undisturbed, and settled like wine on his dregs,
JER.48.11	And he has not been emptied from one vessel to another,
JER.48.11	Nor has he gone into exile.
JER.48.11	Therefore his flavor remains in him,
JER.48.11	And his scent has not changed.
JER.48.12	Therefore behold, the days are coming,” says the L
JER.48.13	And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh [his worthless, disgusting god], as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their [misplaced] confidence.
JER.48.14	How can you say, ‘We are great warriors
JER.48.14	And valiant men in war?’
JER.48.15	Moab has been made desolate and his cities have gone up [in smoke and flame];
JER.48.15	And his chosen young men have gone down to the slaughter,”
JER.48.15	Says the King, whose name is the L
JER.48.16	“The destruction of Moab will come soon,
JER.48.16	And his disaster hurries quickly.
JER.48.17	Show sympathy for him, all you [nations] who are around him,
JER.48.17	And all you [distant nations] who know his name;

JER.48.17	And the splendid staff [of glory]!’
JER.48.18	Come down from your glory,
JER.48.18	O Daughter living in

JER.48.18	For the destroyer of Moab has advanced against you;
JER.48.18	He has destroyed your strongholds.

JER.48.19	Ask [of] him who flees and [ask of] her who escapes,
JER.48.19	Saying, ‘What has happened?’
JER.48.20	Moab is shamed, for she has been broken down 
JER.48.20	Wail and cry out!
JER.48.20	Tell by [the banks of] the Arnon
JER.48.20	That Moab has been destroyed.
JER.48.21	“Judgment has come on [the land of] the plain—upon Holon, Jahzah, and against Mephaath, 
JER.48.22	against Dibon, Nebo, and Beth-diblathaim, 
JER.48.23	against Kiriathaim, Beth-gamul, and Beth-meon, 
JER.48.24	against Kerioth, Bozrah and all the cities of the land of Moab, far and near. 
JER.48.25	The horn (strength) of Moab has been cut off and his arm [of authority] is shattered,” says the L
JER.48.26	“Make him drunk, for he has become arrogant 
JER.48.27	For was not Israel a laughingstock to you? Was he caught among thieves? For whenever you speak of him you shake 
JER.48.28	You inhabitants of Moab,
JER.48.28	Leave the cities and live among the rocks,
JER.48.28	And be like the dove that makes her nest
JER.48.28	In the walls of the yawning ravine.
JER.48.29	We have heard of the [giddy] pride of Moab, the extremely proud one—
JER.48.29	His haughtiness, his arrogance, his conceit, and his self-exaltation.
JER.48.30	I know his [insolent] wrath,” says the L
JER.48.30	“But it is futile;
JER.48.30	His idle boasts [in his deeds] have accomplished nothing.
JER.48.31	Therefore I will wail over Moab,
JER.48.31	And I will cry out for all Moab.
JER.48.31	I will sigh 
JER.48.32	O vines of Sibmah, I will weep for you
JER.48.32	More than the weeping of Jazer [over its ruins and wasted vineyards].
JER.48.32	Your tendrils [of influence] stretched across the sea,
JER.48.32	Reaching [even] to the sea of Jazer.
JER.48.32	The destroyer has fallen
JER.48.32	On your summer fruits and your [season’s] crop of grapes.
JER.48.33	So joy and gladness are taken away
JER.48.33	From the fruitful field and from the land of Moab.
JER.48.33	And I have made the wine cease from the wine presses;
JER.48.33	No one treads 
JER.48.33	Their shouting is not joyful shouting [but is instead, a battle cry].
JER.48.34	From the outcry at Heshbon even to Elealeh, even to Jahaz they have raised their voice, from Zoar even to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah; for even the waters of Nimrim will become desolations. 
JER.48.35	Moreover, I will cause to cease in Moab,” says the L
JER.48.36	“Therefore My heart moans 
JER.48.37	For every head is [shaven] bald and every beard cut off; there are cuts (slashes) on all the hands and sackcloth on the 
JER.48.38	On all the housetops of Moab and in its streets there is lamentation (expressions of grief for the dead) everywhere, for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which there is no pleasure,” says the L
JER.48.39	“How it is broken down! How they have wailed! How Moab has turned his back in shame! So Moab will become a laughingstock and a [horrifying] terror to all who are around him.”
JER.48.40	For thus says the L
JER.48.40	“Behold, one (Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon) will fly swiftly like an eagle
JER.48.40	And spread out his wings against Moab.
JER.48.41	Kerioth [and the cities] has been taken
JER.48.41	And the strongholds seized;
JER.48.41	And the hearts of the warriors of Moab in that day
JER.48.41	Shall be like the heart of a woman in childbirth.
JER.48.42	Moab will be 
JER.48.42	Because he has become arrogant 
JER.48.43	Terror and pit and snare are before you,
JER.48.43	O inhabitant of Moab,” says the L
JER.48.44	“The one who flees from the terror
JER.48.44	Will fall into the pit,
JER.48.44	And the one who gets up out of the pit
JER.48.44	Will be taken 
JER.48.44	For I shall bring upon it, even upon Moab,
JER.48.44	The year of their punishment,” says the L
JER.48.45	“In the shadow of Heshbon
JER.48.45	The fugitives stand powerless [helpless and without strength],
JER.48.45	For a fire has gone out from Heshbon,
JER.48.45	A flame from the midst of Sihon;
JER.48.45	It has destroyed the forehead of Moab
JER.48.45	And the crowns of the heads of [the arrogant Moabites] the ones in tumult.
JER.48.46	Woe (judgment is coming) to you, O Moab!
JER.48.46	The people of [the pagan god called] Chemosh have perished;
JER.48.46	For your sons have been taken away captive
JER.48.46	And your daughters into captivity.
JER.48.47	Yet I will return the captives 
JER.48.47	In the latter days,” says the L
JER.49.1	Concerning the 
JER.49.1	Thus says the L
JER.49.1	“Does Israel have no sons [to reclaim Gad from the Ammonites]?
JER.49.1	Has he no heir?
JER.49.1	Why then has

JER.49.2	Therefore behold, the days are coming,” says the L
JER.49.2	“When I will cause an alarm of war to be heard
JER.49.2	Against Rabbah of the Ammonites;
JER.49.2	And it [along with the high ground on which it stands] will become a desolate heap,
JER.49.2	And its villages will be set on fire.
JER.49.2	Then will Israel take possession of his possessors,”
JER.49.2	Says the L
JER.49.3	“Wail, O 
JER.49.3	Cry out, O daughters of Rabbah!
JER.49.3	Wrap yourselves with sackcloth and lament (cry out in grief),
JER.49.3	And rush back and forth inside the enclosures;
JER.49.3	For Malcam [your powerless god] will go into exile
JER.49.3	Together with his priests and his princes.
JER.49.4	Why do you boast of your valleys?
JER.49.4	Your valley is flowing away,
JER.49.4	[O Ammon] rebellious 
JER.49.4	Who trusts in her treasures, 
JER.49.4	‘Who will come against me?’
JER.49.5	Behold, I am going to bring terror on you,”
JER.49.5	Says the Lord G
JER.49.5	“From all who are around you;

JER.49.6	But 
JER.49.6	The captivity of the children of Ammon 
JER.49.6	Says the L
JER.49.7	Concerning Edom.
JER.49.7	Thus says the L
JER.49.7	“Is there no longer any wisdom in 
JER.49.7	Has good counsel vanished from the intelligent 
JER.49.7	Has their wisdom decayed?

JER.49.9	If thieves came by night,
JER.49.9	Would they not destroy [only] what is enough [for them]?
JER.49.10	But I have stripped Esau (Edom) bare;
JER.49.10	I have uncovered his hiding places
JER.49.10	And he cannot hide himself.

JER.49.12	For thus says the L
JER.49.13	For I have sworn [an oath] by Myself,” says the L
JER.49.14	I have heard a report from the L
JER.49.14	And a messenger has been sent to the nations, saying,
JER.49.14	“Gather together and come against her,
JER.49.14	And rise up for the battle.”
JER.49.15	“For behold, [Edom] I have made you small among the nations
JER.49.15	And despised among men.

JER.49.18	As [it was] in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah with their neighboring cities,” says the L
JER.49.19	See, one will come like a lion from the thicket of the Jordan against the enduring habitation [of Edom] 
JER.49.20	Therefore hear the plan of the L
JER.49.21	The earth has quaked at the noise of their downfall. There is an outcry! The sound of its noise has been heard at the Red Sea. 
JER.49.22	Behold, He will mount up and fly swiftly like an eagle and spread His wings against [the city of] Bozrah; and in that day the heart of the mighty warriors of Edom will be like the heart of a woman in childbirth.
JER.49.23	Concerning Damascus [in Syria].
JER.49.23	“Hamath and Arpad are perplexed 
JER.49.23	For they have heard bad news;
JER.49.23	They are disheartened;
JER.49.23	Troubled 
JER.49.23	Which cannot be calmed.
JER.49.24	Damascus has become helpless;

JER.49.25	Why has the renowned city not been deserted,
JER.49.25	The city of My joy!
JER.49.26	Therefore, her young men will fall in her streets,
JER.49.26	And all her men of war will be destroyed in that day,” says the L

JER.49.29	They will carry off for themselves
JER.49.29	Their tent curtains, all their goods and their camels,
JER.49.29	And they will call out to one another, ‘Terror on every side!’
JER.49.30	Flee, run far away! Dwell in the depths [of the desert],

JER.49.32	Their camels will become plunder,
JER.49.32	And their herds of cattle a spoil;

JER.49.32	And I will bring their disaster from every side,” says the L
JER.49.33	“Hazor will become a haunt

JER.50.26	Let nothing be left of her.

JER.50.27	Let them go down to the slaughter!
JER.50.27	Woe (judgment is coming) to the Chaldeans, for their day has come,
JER.50.27	The time of their punishment.
JER.50.28	Listen to the voice of the refugees who flee and escape from the land of Babylon,
JER.50.28	Proclaiming in Zion the vengeance of the L
JER.50.28	The vengeance [of the L
JER.50.29	“Call together many [archers] against Babylon,

JER.50.29	Repay her according to her actions;
JER.50.29	Just as she has done, do to her.
JER.50.29	For she has been proudly defiant

JER.50.35	A sword against the Chaldeans,” says the L
JER.50.35	“And against the inhabitants of Babylon
JER.50.35	And against her princes (officials, civic rulers) and against her wise men (astrologers, religious rulers)!
JER.50.36	A sword against the oracle priests (the babbling liars), and they will become fools!
JER.50.36	A sword against her mighty warriors, and they will be shattered 
JER.50.37	A sword against their horses and against their chariots

JER.50.37	A sword against her treasures, and they will be plundered!
JER.50.38	A drought on her waters, and they will dry up!
JER.50.38	For it is a land of [worthless] idols,

JER.51.59	The message which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the grandson of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now this Seraiah was chief chamberlain 
JER.51.60	So Jeremiah wrote in a single scroll all the disaster which would come on Babylon, [that is] all these words which have been written concerning Babylon. 
JER.51.61	Then Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “When you come to Babylon, see to it that you read all these words aloud, 
JER.51.62	and say, ‘You, O L
JER.51.63	And as soon as you finish reading this scroll, you shall tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates. 
JER.51.64	Then say, ‘In the same way Babylon will sink down and not rise because of the disaster that I will bring on her; and the Babylonians will become [hopelessly] exhausted.’ ” Thus the words of Jeremiah are completed.
JER.52.1	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of 
JER.52.2	He did that which was evil in the sight of the L
JER.52.3	For all this came about in Jerusalem and Judah because of the anger of the L
JER.52.4	Now it came about in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem; and they camped against it and built moveable towers 
JER.52.5	So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. 
JER.52.6	In the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land. 
JER.52.7	Then the city was broken into, and all the soldiers fled. They left the city at night [as Ezekiel prophesied] passing through the gate between the two walls by the king’s garden, though the Chaldeans were all around the city. They fled by way of the Arabah (the Jordan Valley). 
JER.52.8	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and his entire army was scattered from him. 
JER.52.9	Then they seized the king and brought him to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the [Syrian] land of Hamath [on the northern border of Israel], where he pronounced sentence on him. 
JER.52.10	The king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes; he also killed all the princes of Judah at Riblah. 
JER.52.11	Then the king of Babylon blinded Zedekiah, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon and there he put him in prison 
JER.52.12	Now in the fifth month, on the tenth day, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan captain of the guard, who served the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. 
JER.52.13	He burned down the house of the L
JER.52.14	So all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down all the walls around Jerusalem. 
JER.52.15	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took away into exile some of the poorest of the people, those who were left in the city [at the time it was captured], along with those who deserted to join the king of Babylon [during the siege] and the rest of the artisans. 
JER.52.16	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and farmers.
JER.52.17	Now the Chaldeans broke into pieces the pillars of bronze which belonged to the house of the L
JER.52.18	They also took away the pots [for carrying away ashes] and the shovels and the snuffers and the bowls and the spoons and all the bronze articles used in the 
JER.52.19	The captain of the guard also took away the [small] bowls and the firepans and the basins and the pots and the lampstands and the incense cups and the bowls for the drink offerings—whatever was made of fine gold and whatever was made of fine silver. 
JER.52.20	The two pillars, the one [enormous] Sea (basin), and 
JER.52.21	Concerning the pillars, the height of each pillar was eighteen cubits (twenty-seven feet), and a line [an ornamental molding] of twelve cubits (eighteen feet) went around its circumference; it was four fingers thick, and [the pillar was] hollow. 
JER.52.22	A capital of bronze was on [top of] it. The height of each capital was five cubits (seven and one-half feet), with a lattice-work and pomegranates around it, all of bronze. The second pillar also, with its pomegranates, was similar to these. 
JER.52.23	There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; and a hundred pomegranates were on the lattice-work all around.
JER.52.24	Then the captain of the guard took [as prisoners] Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah the second priest and the three doorkeepers. 
JER.52.25	He also took out of the city one official who was overseer of the soldiers, and seven of the king’s advisers who were found in the city, and the scribe of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men who were still in the city. 
JER.52.26	Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
JER.52.27	Then the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was led away into exile from its own land.
JER.52.28	This is the number of people whom Nebuchadnezzar took captive 
JER.52.29	in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, [he took captive] 832 persons from Jerusalem; 
JER.52.30	in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the [Babylonian] guard took captive 745 Jewish people; there were 4,600 persons in all.
JER.52.31	Now it came about in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin [also called Coniah and Jeconiah] king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth of the month, Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, 
JER.52.32	He spoke kindly to him and gave him a throne above the thrones of the kings who were [captives] with him in Babylon. 
JER.52.33	Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes, and he dined regularly at the king’s table all the days of his life. 
JER.52.34	And his allowance, a regular allowance was given to him by the king of Babylon, a daily portion [according to his needs] until the day of his death,

LAM.1.2	She weeps bitterly in the night
LAM.1.2	And her tears are [constantly] on her cheeks;
LAM.1.2	Among all her lovers (political allies)
LAM.1.2	She has no one to comfort her.
LAM.1.2	All her friends have dealt treacherously with her;
LAM.1.2	They have become her enemies.
LAM.1.3	Judah has gone into exile under affliction
LAM.1.3	And under harsh servitude;
LAM.1.3	She dwells among the [pagan] nations,
LAM.1.3	But she has found no rest;
LAM.1.3	All her pursuers have overtaken her
LAM.1.3	In the midst of [her] distress.
LAM.1.4	The roads to Zion are in mourning
LAM.1.4	Because no one comes to the appointed feasts.
LAM.1.4	All her gates are desolate;
LAM.1.4	Her priests are groaning,

LAM.1.6	Her princes have become like deer
LAM.1.6	That have found no pasture;
LAM.1.6	They have fled without strength
LAM.1.6	Before the pursuer.
LAM.1.7	In the days of her affliction and homelessness
LAM.1.7	Jerusalem remembers all her precious things
LAM.1.7	That she had from the days of old,
LAM.1.7	When her people fell into the hand of the adversary,
LAM.1.7	And no one helped her,
LAM.1.7	The enemy saw her,
LAM.1.7	They mocked at her downfall.
LAM.1.8	Jerusalem sinned greatly;

LAM.1.8	All who honored her [now] despise her
LAM.1.8	Because they have seen her nakedness;
LAM.1.8	Even she herself groans and turns [her face] away.
LAM.1.9	Her (ceremonial) uncleanness was on her skirts;
LAM.1.9	She did not [seriously] consider her future.
LAM.1.9	Therefore she has come down [from throne to slavery] in an astonishing manner;
LAM.1.9	She has no comforter.
LAM.1.9	“O L
LAM.1.9	For the enemy has magnified himself [in triumph]!”
LAM.1.10	The adversary has spread out his hand
LAM.1.10	Over all her precious

LAM.1.10	That they should not enter into Your congregation [not even in the outer courts].
LAM.1.11	All her people groan, seeking bread;
LAM.1.11	They have exchanged their desirable 
LAM.1.11	To restore their lives.
LAM.1.11	“See, O L
LAM.1.11	How despised 
LAM.1.12	“Is it nothing to you, all you who pass this way?
LAM.1.12	Look and see if there is any pain like my pain
LAM.1.12	Which was severely dealt out to me,
LAM.1.12	Which the L
LAM.1.13	From on high He sent fire into my bones,
LAM.1.13	And it prevailed 
LAM.1.13	He has spread a net for my feet;
LAM.1.13	He has turned me back.
LAM.1.13	He has made me desolate 
LAM.1.13	Faint all the day long.
LAM.1.14	The yoke of my transgressions is bound;
LAM.1.14	By His hand they are knit 
LAM.1.14	They have come upon my neck.
LAM.1.14	He has made my strength fail;
LAM.1.14	The Lord has put me into the hand
LAM.1.14	Of 
LAM.1.15	The Lord has rejected all the strong men
LAM.1.15	In my midst;
LAM.1.15	He has proclaimed an established time against me
LAM.1.15	To crush my young men.
LAM.1.15	The Lord has trampled down as in a wine press
LAM.1.15	The Virgin Daughter of Judah.
LAM.1.16	I weep for these things;
LAM.1.16	My eyes overflow with tears,
LAM.1.16	Because a comforter,
LAM.1.16	One who could restore my soul, is far away from me.
LAM.1.16	My children are desolate 
LAM.1.16	For the enemy has prevailed.”
LAM.1.17	Zion stretches out her hands,
LAM.1.17	But there is no comforter for her.
LAM.1.17	The L
LAM.1.17	That his neighbors should be his enemies;
LAM.1.17	Jerusalem has become a filthy thing [an object of contempt] among them.
LAM.1.18	“The L
LAM.1.18	For I have rebelled against His commandment (His word).
LAM.1.18	Hear now, all you peoples,
LAM.1.18	And look at my pain;
LAM.1.18	My virgins and my young men
LAM.1.18	Have gone into captivity.
LAM.1.19	I [Jerusalem] called to my lovers (political allies), but they deceived me.
LAM.1.19	My priests and my elders perished in the city
LAM.1.19	While they looked for food to restore their strength.
LAM.1.20	See, O L
LAM.1.20	My spirit is deeply disturbed;
LAM.1.20	My heart is overturned within me 
LAM.1.20	For I have been very rebellious.
LAM.1.20	In the street the sword kills 
LAM.1.20	In the house there is [famine, disease and] death!
LAM.1.21	People have heard that I groan,
LAM.1.21	That I have no comforter [in You].
LAM.1.21	All my enemies have heard of my desperation;
LAM.1.21	They are delighted [O L

LAM.1.21	So that they will become like me.
LAM.1.22	Let all their wickedness come before You;
LAM.1.22	And deal with them as You have dealt with me
LAM.1.22	Because of all my transgressions;
LAM.1.22	For my groans are many and my heart is faint.”
LAM.2.1	How the Lord has covered the Daughter of Zion (Jerusalem)
LAM.2.1	With a cloud in His anger!
LAM.2.1	He has cast down from heaven to the earth
LAM.2.1	The glory 
LAM.2.1	And has not remembered His footstool
LAM.2.1	In the day of His anger.
LAM.2.2	The Lord has swallowed up; He has not spared
LAM.2.2	All the country places of Jacob.
LAM.2.2	In His wrath He has thrown down
LAM.2.2	The strongholds of the Daughter of Judah (Jerusalem).
LAM.2.2	He has brought them down to the ground [in disgrace];
LAM.2.2	He has debased the kingdom and its princes.
LAM.2.3	In fierce anger He has cut off 
LAM.2.3	Every 
LAM.2.3	He has withdrawn His right hand
LAM.2.3	From the presence of the enemy.
LAM.2.3	And He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire
LAM.2.3	Consuming all around.
LAM.2.4	He has bent His bow like an enemy;
LAM.2.4	He has set His right hand like an adversary
LAM.2.4	And slain all that were delightful 
LAM.2.4	In the tent of the Daughter of Zion
LAM.2.4	He has poured out His wrath like fire.
LAM.2.5	The Lord has become like an enemy;
LAM.2.5	He has swallowed up Israel.
LAM.2.5	He has swallowed up all its palaces;
LAM.2.5	He has destroyed its strongholds
LAM.2.5	And multiplied in the Daughter of Judah
LAM.2.5	Mourning and lamentation (expressions of grief).
LAM.2.6	And He has violently broken down His temple like a [fragile] garden 
LAM.2.6	He has destroyed His appointed meeting place.
LAM.2.6	The L
LAM.2.6	To be forgotten in Zion
LAM.2.6	And has despised 
LAM.2.6	In the indignation of His anger.
LAM.2.7	The Lord has rejected His altar;
LAM.2.7	He has abandoned His sanctuary.
LAM.2.7	He has given into the hand of the enemy
LAM.2.7	The walls of her palaces;
LAM.2.7	They have made a noise in the house of the L
LAM.2.7	As on a day of an appointed feast.
LAM.2.8	The L
LAM.2.8	The [city] wall of the Daughter of Zion.
LAM.2.8	He has stretched out a line,
LAM.2.8	He has not stopped His hand from destroying.
LAM.2.8	He has caused the rampart and the wall to lament (mourn in grief);
LAM.2.8	They have languished together.
LAM.2.9	Her gates have sunk into the ground;
LAM.2.9	He has destroyed and broken her bars.
LAM.2.9	Her king and her princes are [exiled] among the nations;
LAM.2.9	The law is no more.
LAM.2.9	Also, her prophets no longer find
LAM.2.9	Vision from the L
LAM.2.10	The elders of the Daughter of Zion
LAM.2.10	Sit on the ground keeping silent;
LAM.2.10	They have thrown dust on their heads,
LAM.2.10	They have covered themselves with sackcloth.
LAM.2.10	The virgins of Jerusalem
LAM.2.10	Have bowed their heads to the ground.
LAM.2.11	My eyes fail because of tears [mourns Jeremiah],
LAM.2.11	My spirit is deeply disturbed;
LAM.2.11	My heart is poured out on the earth [in grief]
LAM.2.11	Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people [Jerusalem],
LAM.2.11	When little ones and infants faint
LAM.2.11	In the streets of the city.
LAM.2.12	They cry to their mothers,
LAM.2.12	“Where is grain and wine?”
LAM.2.12	As they faint like a wounded man
LAM.2.12	In the streets of the city,
LAM.2.12	As their life [slips away and] is poured out
LAM.2.12	In their mothers’ arms.
LAM.2.13	How shall I console you?
LAM.2.13	To what shall I compare you,
LAM.2.13	O Daughter of Jerusalem?
LAM.2.13	With what shall I compare you, so that I may comfort you,
LAM.2.13	O Virgin Daughter of Zion?
LAM.2.13	For your ruin is as vast as the sea;
LAM.2.13	Who can heal you?
LAM.2.14	Your prophets have seen (imagined) for you
LAM.2.14	False and foolish 
LAM.2.14	And they have not exposed your wickedness
LAM.2.14	To restore you from captivity [by teaching you to repent],
LAM.2.14	But they have seen (imagined) 
LAM.2.15	All who pass along the way
LAM.2.15	Clap their hands 
LAM.2.15	They scoff and shake their heads
LAM.2.15	At the Daughter of Jerusalem, saying,
LAM.2.15	“Is this the city that was called
LAM.2.15	‘The perfection of beauty,
LAM.2.15	The joy of all the earth’?”
LAM.2.16	All your enemies
LAM.2.16	Have opened their mouths wide against you;
LAM.2.16	They [scornfully] hiss and gnash 
LAM.2.16	They say, “We have swallowed her up!
LAM.2.16	Certainly this is the day for which we waited;
LAM.2.16	We have reached it, we have seen it!”
LAM.2.17	The L
LAM.2.17	He has accomplished His word
LAM.2.17	Which He commanded 
LAM.2.17	He has demolished without sparing,
LAM.2.17	And He has caused the enemy to rejoice over you;
LAM.2.17	He has exalted the power of your enemies.
LAM.2.18	Their hearts cried out to the Lord.
LAM.2.18	“O wall of the Daughter of Zion,
LAM.2.18	Let your tears run down like a river day and night;
LAM.2.18	Give yourself no relief,
LAM.2.18	Let your eyes have no rest.
LAM.2.19	Arise, cry aloud in the night,
LAM.2.19	At the beginning of the night watches;
LAM.2.19	Pour out your heart like water
LAM.2.19	Before the presence of the Lord;
LAM.2.19	Lift up your hands to Him
LAM.2.19	For the life of your little ones
LAM.2.19	Who are faint from hunger
LAM.2.19	At the head of every street.”
LAM.2.20	See, O L
LAM.2.20	With whom have You dealt this way?
LAM.2.20	Should women eat their offspring,
LAM.2.20	The little ones 
LAM.2.20	Should priest and prophet be killed
LAM.2.20	In the sanctuary of the Lord?
LAM.2.21	The young and the old
LAM.2.21	Lie on the ground in the streets;
LAM.2.21	My virgins and my young men
LAM.2.21	Have fallen by the sword.
LAM.2.21	You have killed them in the day of Your anger,
LAM.2.21	You have slaughtered, not sparing.
LAM.2.22	You [L
LAM.2.22	My terrors (dangers) on every side;
LAM.2.22	And there was no one who escaped or survived
LAM.2.22	In the day of the L
LAM.2.22	Those I have cared for and brought up with tenderness,
LAM.2.22	My enemy annihilated them.
LAM.3.1	I am [Jeremiah] the man who has seen affliction
LAM.3.1	Because of the rod of His wrath.
LAM.3.2	He has led me and made me walk
LAM.3.2	In darkness and not in light.
LAM.3.3	Surely He has turned His hand against me
LAM.3.3	Repeatedly all the day.
LAM.3.4	He has caused my flesh and my skin to waste away;
LAM.3.4	He has shattered my bones.
LAM.3.5	He has besieged and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.
LAM.3.6	He has made me live in dark places
LAM.3.6	Like those who have long been dead.
LAM.3.7	He walled me in so that I cannot get out;
LAM.3.7	He has weighted down my chain.
LAM.3.8	Even when I cry out and shout for help,
LAM.3.8	He shuts out my prayer.
LAM.3.9	He has blocked my ways with cut stone;
LAM.3.9	He has made my paths crooked.
LAM.3.10	He is to me like a bear lying in wait,
LAM.3.10	And like a lion [hiding] in secret places.
LAM.3.11	He has turned aside my ways and torn me in pieces;
LAM.3.11	He has made me desolate.
LAM.3.12	He has bent His bow
LAM.3.12	And set me as a target for the arrow.
LAM.3.13	He has caused the arrows of His quiver
LAM.3.13	To enter my inner parts.
LAM.3.14	I have become the [object of] ridicule to all my people,
LAM.3.14	And [the subject of] their 
LAM.3.15	He has filled me with bitterness;
LAM.3.15	He has made me drunk with wormwood (bitterness).
LAM.3.16	He has broken my teeth with gravel;
LAM.3.16	He has [covered me with ashes and] made me cower in the dust.
LAM.3.17	My soul has been cast far away from peace;
LAM.3.17	I have forgotten happiness.
LAM.3.18	So I say, “My strength has perished
LAM.3.18	And so has my hope 
LAM.3.19	Remember [O L
LAM.3.20	My soul 
LAM.3.20	And is bowed down within me.
LAM.3.21	But this I call to mind,
LAM.3.21	Therefore I have hope.
LAM.3.22	It is because of the L
LAM.3.22	Because His [tender] compassions never fail.
LAM.3.23	They are new every morning;
LAM.3.23	Great 
LAM.3.24	“The L
LAM.3.24	“Therefore I have hope in Him 
LAM.3.25	The L
LAM.3.25	To those who seek Him [on the authority of God’s word].
LAM.3.26	It is good that one waits quietly
LAM.3.26	For the salvation of the L
LAM.3.27	It is good for a man that he should bear
LAM.3.27	The yoke [of godly discipline] in his youth.
LAM.3.28	Let him sit alone [in hope] and keep quiet,
LAM.3.28	Because God has laid it on him [for his benefit].
LAM.3.29	Let him put his mouth in the dust [in recognition of his unworthiness];
LAM.3.29	There may yet be hope.
LAM.3.30	Let him give his cheek to the one who strikes him;
LAM.3.30	Let him be filled with reproach.
LAM.3.31	For the Lord will not reject forever,
LAM.3.32	For if He causes grief,
LAM.3.32	Then He will have compassion
LAM.3.32	According to His abundant lovingkindness 
LAM.3.33	For He does not afflict willingly 
LAM.3.33	Or grieve the children of men.
LAM.3.34	To trample 
LAM.3.34	All the prisoners of the land,
LAM.3.35	To deprive a man of justice
LAM.3.35	In the presence of the Most High,
LAM.3.36	To defraud a man in his lawsuit—
LAM.3.36	The Lord does not approve of these things.
LAM.3.37	Who is there who speaks and it comes to pass,
LAM.3.37	Unless the Lord has authorized 
LAM.3.38	Is it not from the mouth of the Most High
LAM.3.38	That both adversity (misfortune) and good (prosperity, happiness) proceed?
LAM.3.39	Why should any living mortal, or any man,
LAM.3.39	Complain [of punishment] in view of his sins?
LAM.3.40	Let us test and examine our ways,
LAM.3.40	And let us return to the L
LAM.3.41	Let us lift up our hearts and our hands [in prayer]
LAM.3.41	Toward God in heaven;
LAM.3.42	We have transgressed and rebelled,
LAM.3.42	You have not pardoned.
LAM.3.43	You have covered 
LAM.3.43	And pursued us;
LAM.3.43	You have slain [without pity] and have not spared.
LAM.3.44	You have covered Yourself with a cloud
LAM.3.44	So that no prayer can pass through.
LAM.3.45	You have made us scum and refuse
LAM.3.45	Among the peoples (Gentile nations).
LAM.3.46	All our enemies have gaped at us.
LAM.3.47	Panic and pitfall (traps, danger) have come on us,
LAM.3.47	Devastation and destruction.
LAM.3.48	My eyes overflow with streams of tears
LAM.3.48	Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people (Jerusalem).
LAM.3.49	My eyes overflow unceasingly,
LAM.3.49	Without stopping,
LAM.3.50	Until the L
LAM.3.50	And sees from heaven.
LAM.3.51	My eyes [see things that] bring pain to my soul
LAM.3.51	Because of all the daughters of my city.
LAM.3.52	Without cause my enemies
LAM.3.52	Hunted me down like a bird;
LAM.3.53	They silenced me in the pit
LAM.3.53	And placed a stone over me.
LAM.3.54	The waters ran down on my head;
LAM.3.54	I said, “I am cut off (destroyed)!”
LAM.3.55	I called on Your name, O L
LAM.3.55	Out of the lowest pit.
LAM.3.56	You have heard my voice,
LAM.3.56	“Do not hide Your ear from my 
LAM.3.56	From my cry for help.”
LAM.3.57	You drew near on the day I called to You;
LAM.3.57	You said, “Do not fear.”
LAM.3.58	O Lord, You have pleaded my soul’s cause [You have guided my way and protected me];
LAM.3.58	You have rescued 
LAM.3.59	O L
LAM.3.59	Judge my case.
LAM.3.60	You have seen all their vengeance,
LAM.3.60	All their schemes against me.
LAM.3.61	You have heard their reproach, O L
LAM.3.61	And all their schemes against me.
LAM.3.62	The lips and whispering of my assailants
LAM.3.62	Are against me all day long.
LAM.3.63	Look at their sitting and their rising [their actions and secret counsels];
LAM.3.63	I am their mocking song [the subject of their ridicule].
LAM.3.64	You will repay them, O L
LAM.3.64	According to the work of their hands.
LAM.3.65	You will harden their hearts;
LAM.3.65	Your curse will be upon them.
LAM.3.66	You will pursue them in anger and destroy them
LAM.3.66	From under the heavens of the L
LAM.4.1	How dark 
LAM.4.1	How the pure gold has changed!
LAM.4.1	The sacred stones [of the temple] are poured out 
LAM.4.1	At the head of every street.
LAM.4.2	The [noble and] precious sons of Zion,
LAM.4.2	[Once] worth their weight in fine gold,
LAM.4.2	How they are regarded [merely] as earthen jars,
LAM.4.2	The work of a potter’s hands!
LAM.4.3	Even the jackals offer the breast,
LAM.4.3	They nurse their young;
LAM.4.3	But the daughter of my people has become cruel
LAM.4.3	Like ostriches in the wilderness [that desert their young].
LAM.4.4	The tongue of the infant clings
LAM.4.4	To the roof of its mouth because of thirst;
LAM.4.4	The little ones ask for food,
LAM.4.4	But no one gives it to them.
LAM.4.5	Those who feasted on delicacies
LAM.4.5	Are perishing in the streets;
LAM.4.5	Those reared in purple [as nobles]
LAM.4.5	Embrace ash heaps.
LAM.4.6	For the [punishment of the] wickedness of the daughter of my people [Jerusalem]
LAM.4.6	Is greater than the [punishment for the] sin of Sodom,
LAM.4.6	Which was overthrown in a moment,
LAM.4.6	And no hands were turned toward her [to offer help].
LAM.4.7	Her princes were purer than snow,
LAM.4.7	They were whiter than milk [in appearance];
LAM.4.7	They were more ruddy in body than rubies,
LAM.4.7	Their polishing was like lapis lazuli (sapphire).
LAM.4.8	Their appearance is [now] blacker than soot [because of the prolonged famine];
LAM.4.8	They are not recognized in the streets;
LAM.4.8	Their skin clings to their bones;
LAM.4.8	It is withered, and it has become [dry] like wood.
LAM.4.9	Those killed with the sword
LAM.4.9	Are more fortunate than those killed with hunger;
LAM.4.9	For the hungry pine 
LAM.4.9	For the lack of the fruits of the field.
LAM.4.10	The hands of compassionate women
LAM.4.10	Boiled their own children;
LAM.4.10	They became food for them
LAM.4.10	Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people [Judah].
LAM.4.11	The L
LAM.4.11	He has poured out His fierce anger
LAM.4.11	And has kindled a fire in Zion
LAM.4.11	That has consumed her foundations.
LAM.4.12	The kings of the earth did not believe,
LAM.4.12	Nor did any of the inhabitants of the earth,
LAM.4.12	That the adversary (oppressor) and enemy
LAM.4.12	Could enter the gates of Jerusalem.
LAM.4.13	Because of the sins of her [counterfeit] prophets
LAM.4.13	And the wickedness of her [unfaithful] priests,
LAM.4.13	Who have shed in her midst
LAM.4.13	The blood of the just 
LAM.4.14	They wandered, blind, in the streets;
LAM.4.14	They were defiled with blood
LAM.4.14	So that no one could touch their garments.
LAM.4.15	People cried to them, “Go away! Unclean!
LAM.4.15	Depart! Depart! Do not touch!”
LAM.4.15	So they fled, then they wandered [as fugitives];
LAM.4.15	People among the nations said,
LAM.4.15	“They shall not stay here any longer 
LAM.4.16	The presence of the L
LAM.4.16	He will not continue to look after them.
LAM.4.16	They did not honor the priests;
LAM.4.16	They did not favor the elders.
LAM.4.17	[And as for us,] yet our eyes failed,
LAM.4.17	Looking in vain for help.
LAM.4.17	Watching [from the towers] we watched
LAM.4.17	For a nation that could not save.
LAM.4.18	The enemy hunted our steps,
LAM.4.18	So that we could not walk in our streets;
LAM.4.18	Our end drew near,
LAM.4.18	Our days were finished
LAM.4.18	For our end had come.
LAM.4.19	Our pursuers were swifter
LAM.4.19	Than the eagles of the sky;
LAM.4.19	They pursued us on the mountains,
LAM.4.19	They waited in ambush for us in the wilderness.
LAM.4.20	The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the L
LAM.4.20	Was captured in their snares,
LAM.4.20	He of whom we had said, “Under his shadow
LAM.4.20	We shall live among the nations.”
LAM.4.21	Rejoice and be glad, O Daughter of Edom,
LAM.4.21	Who lives in the land of Uz.
LAM.4.21	But the cup [of the wine of God’s wrath] will pass to you as well;
LAM.4.21	You will become drunk and make yourself naked.
LAM.4.22	The L
LAM.4.22	But He will punish your sin, O Daughter of Edom;
LAM.4.22	He will expose your sins.
LAM.5.1	O L
LAM.5.1	Look, and see our reproach (national disgrace)!
LAM.5.2	Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers,
LAM.5.2	Our houses to foreigners.
LAM.5.3	We have become orphans without a father;
LAM.5.3	Our mothers are like widows.
LAM.5.4	We have to pay for our drinking water;
LAM.5.4	Our wood comes to us at a price.
LAM.5.5	Our pursuers are at our necks;
LAM.5.5	We are worn out, there is no rest for us.
LAM.5.6	We have given the hand [as a pledge of fidelity and submission] to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread.
LAM.5.7	Our fathers sinned, and are no more;
LAM.5.7	It is 
LAM.5.8	Servants rule over us;
LAM.5.8	There is no one to rescue us out of their hand.
LAM.5.9	We get our bread at the risk of our lives
LAM.5.9	Because of the sword [of the Arabs] in the wilderness [who may attack if we go out to harvest the crop].
LAM.5.10	Our skin is as hot as [the heat of] an oven
LAM.5.10	Because of the burning heat of [the fever of] famine.
LAM.5.11	They ravished the women in Zion,
LAM.5.11	The virgins in the cities of Judah.
LAM.5.12	Princes were hung by their hands;
LAM.5.12	Elders were not respected.
LAM.5.13	Young men worked at the grinding mill,
LAM.5.13	And boys fell [staggering] under loads of wood.
LAM.5.14	Elders are gone from the gate;
LAM.5.14	Young men from their music.
LAM.5.15	The joy of our hearts has ended;
LAM.5.15	Our dancing has been turned into mourning.
LAM.5.16	The crown has fallen from our head [our honor is covered with dust]!
LAM.5.16	Woe to us, for we have sinned!
LAM.5.17	Because of this our heart is faint,
LAM.5.17	Because of these things our eyes are dim.
LAM.5.18	As for Mount Zion, which lies desolate,
LAM.5.18	Foxes 
LAM.5.19	But You, O L
LAM.5.19	Your throne endures from generation to [all] generations.
LAM.5.20	Why do You forget us forever?
LAM.5.20	Why do You forsake us so long?
LAM.5.21	Return us to You, O L
LAM.5.21	Renew our days as of old,
LAM.5.22	Unless You have utterly rejected us
LAM.5.22	And are exceedingly angry with us.
EZK.1.1	Now it came about [when I was] in my 
EZK.1.2	(On the fifth of the month, which was in the fifth year of 
EZK.1.3	the word of the L
EZK.1.4	As I looked, I saw a stormy wind coming out of the north, a great cloud with fire flashing continually from it; and a brightness was around it, and in its core [there was] something like glowing [amber-colored] metal in the midst of the fire. 
EZK.1.5	Within it there were figures resembling 
EZK.1.6	Each one had four faces and four wings. 
EZK.1.7	Their legs were straight and the soles of their feet were like a calf’s hoof, and they sparkled 
EZK.1.8	Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. As for the faces and wings of the four of them, 
EZK.1.9	their wings touched one another; 
EZK.1.10	Regarding the 
EZK.1.11	Such were their faces. Their wings were stretched out upward; two [wings] of each one were touching another [the wings of the beings on either side of it], and [the remaining] two [wings of each being] were covering their bodies. 
EZK.1.12	And each went straight forward; wherever the spirit was about to go, they would go, without turning as they went. 
EZK.1.13	Among the living beings there was something that looked like burning coals of fire, like torches moving back and forth among the living beings. The fire was bright, and lightning was flashing from the fire. 
EZK.1.14	And the living beings moved rapidly back and forth like flashes of lightning.
EZK.1.15	Now as I looked at the living beings, I saw one wheel on the ground beside the living beings, for each of the four of them. 
EZK.1.16	Regarding the appearance of the wheels and their construction: they gleamed like chrysolite (beryl, olivine); and the four were made alike. Their appearance and construction were a wheel [set at a right angle] within a wheel. 
EZK.1.17	Whenever they moved, they went in any [one] of their four directions without turning as they moved. 
EZK.1.18	Regarding their rims: they were so high that they were awesome 
EZK.1.19	Whenever the living beings moved, the wheels moved with them; and when the living beings rose from the earth, the wheels rose also. 
EZK.1.20	Wherever the spirit went, the beings went in that direction. And the wheels rose along with them; for the spirit 
EZK.1.21	Whenever those went, these went; and whenever those came to a stop, these came to a stop; and whenever those rose from the earth, the wheels rose close beside them, for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels.
EZK.1.22	Now stretched over the heads of the living beings 
EZK.1.23	Under the expanse their wings 
EZK.1.24	As they moved, I also heard the sound of their wings like the sound of great [rushing] waters, like the voice of 
EZK.1.25	And there was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads; whenever they stopped, they lowered their wings.
EZK.1.26	Now above the expanse that was over their heads there was something resembling a throne, it appeared like [it was made of] sapphire 
EZK.1.27	Now upward, from that which appeared to be His waist, I saw something like glowing metal that looked like it was filled with fire all around it; and downward, from that which appeared to be His waist, I saw something like fire; and 
EZK.1.28	As the appearance of the rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the appearance of the surrounding radiance. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory 
EZK.2.1	Then He said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet and I will speak to you.” 
EZK.2.2	Then as He spoke to me the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet; and I heard Him speaking to me. 
EZK.2.3	And He said to me, “I am sending you, son of man, to the children of Israel, to a rebellious people [in both the north and the south] that have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have sinned 
EZK.2.4	I am sending you to them who are stubborn and obstinate children, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord 
EZK.2.5	As for them, whether they listen or refuse [to listen]—for they are a rebellious house—yet they will know 
EZK.2.6	And you, son of man, neither fear them nor fear their words; though briars and thorns are all around you and you sit among scorpions, neither fear their words nor be dismayed at their presence, for they are a rebellious house. 
EZK.2.7	But you shall speak My words to them whether they will listen or refuse [to listen], for they are [most] rebellious.
EZK.2.8	“As for you, son of man, listen to what I say to you; do not be rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.” 
EZK.2.9	Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out toward me; and behold, a scroll of a book was in it. 
EZK.2.10	And He spread it before me, and it was written on the front and on the back, and written on it were [words of] lamentation (funeral songs) and mourning and woe.
EZK.3.1	He said to me, “Son of man, eat what you find [in this book]; eat this scroll, then go, speak to the house of Israel.” 
EZK.3.2	So I opened my mouth, and He fed me the scroll. 
EZK.3.3	He said to me, “Son of man, eat this scroll that I am giving you and fill your stomach with it.” So I ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.
EZK.3.4	Then He said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak My words to them. 
EZK.3.5	For you are not being sent to a people of unintelligible speech or difficult language, but to the house of Israel, 
EZK.3.6	not to many peoples of unintelligible speech or difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. But I have sent you to them who should listen to you 
EZK.3.7	yet the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you 
EZK.3.8	Behold, I have made your face as hard as their faces and your forehead as hard as their foreheads. 
EZK.3.9	I have made your forehead like emery (diamond), harder than flint. Do not be afraid of them or be dismayed before them, though they are a rebellious house.” 
EZK.3.10	Moreover, He said to me, “Son of man, receive into your heart all My words which I will speak to you and hear with your ears (listen closely). 
EZK.3.11	Go to the [Jewish] exiles [in Babylon], to the children of your people, and speak to them, whether they listen or not, and tell them, ‘Thus says the Lord G
EZK.3.12	Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard a great rushing sound behind me, “Blessed be the glory of the L
EZK.3.13	And then I 
EZK.3.14	So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went embittered [by the sins of Israel] in the rage of my spirit; and the hand of the L
EZK.3.15	Then I came to the exiles who lived beside the River Chebar at Tel Abib. I sat there for seven days [in the place] where they were living, overwhelmed with astonishment [by my vision and the work before me].
EZK.3.16	At the end of seven days the word of the L
EZK.3.17	“Son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman to the house of Israel; whenever you hear a word from My mouth, warn them from Me. 
EZK.3.18	When I say to the wicked, ‘You will certainly die,’ and you do not warn him or speak out to tell him to turn from his wicked way to save his life, that same evil man will die in his sin, but you will be responsible for his blood. 
EZK.3.19	However, if you have warned the wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his wicked way, he will die in his sin; but you have 
EZK.3.20	Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness (right standing with God) and sins, and I place an obstacle before him, he will die; since you have not warned him, he will die in his sin, and the righteous deeds which he has done will not be remembered; but you will be responsible for his blood. 
EZK.3.21	However, if you have warned the righteous man not to sin and he does not sin, he will surely live because he took warning; also you have 
EZK.3.22	The hand of the L
EZK.3.23	So I got up and went out to the plain; and behold, the glory 
EZK.3.24	Then the Spirit entered me and made me stand on my feet; He spoke and said to me, “Go, shut yourself up in your house. 
EZK.3.25	As for you, son of man, they will put ropes on you and bind you with them so that you cannot go out among them. 
EZK.3.26	And I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you cannot talk and you cannot be a man who rebukes the people, for they are a rebellious house. 
EZK.3.27	But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth and you will say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord G
EZK.4.1	“Now you, son of man, take a brick, place it before you and inscribe on it [a diagram of] the city of Jerusalem. 
EZK.4.2	Then lay siege against it, build a siege wall, raise a ramp against it; set up [enemy] camps and place battering rams all around it. 
EZK.4.3	Further, take an iron plate and place it as an iron wall between you and the city, and set your face toward it so that it is under siege, and besiege it. This is a sign to the house of Israel.
EZK.4.4	“Then lie down on your left side (toward the north) to bear [symbolically] the wickedness 
EZK.4.5	For I have assigned you the years of their wickedness 
EZK.4.6	When you have completed these [days for Israel], lie down again, but on your right side (toward the south), and you shall bear the wickedness 
EZK.4.7	Then you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem with your arm bared and prophesy against it. 
EZK.4.8	Now behold, I will put ropes on you so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have completed the days of your siege.
EZK.4.9	“But as for you, take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt, and put them into one vessel and make them into bread for yourself. You shall eat it according to the number of the days that you lie on your side, three hundred and ninety days. 
EZK.4.10	The food you eat each day 
EZK.4.11	You shall drink water by measure also, 
EZK.4.12	You shall eat your food as barley cakes, having baked it in their sight over human dung.” 
EZK.4.13	Then the L
EZK.4.14	But I said, “Ah, Lord G
EZK.4.15	Then He said to me, “See, I will let you use cow’s dung instead of human dung over which you shall prepare your food.” 
EZK.4.16	Moreover, He said to me, “Son of man, behold (listen carefully), I am going to break the staff of bread [that supports life] in Jerusalem; and they shall eat bread [rationed] by weight and [eat it] with anxiety 
EZK.4.17	because bread and water will be scarce; and they will look at one another in dismay and waste away [in punishment] for their wickedness.
EZK.5.1	“And you [Ezekiel], son of man, take a sharp sword and use it as a barber’s razor and shave your head and your beard. Then take scales for weighing and divide the hair [into three parts]. 
EZK.5.2	You shall burn one third with fire in the center of the city, when the days of the siege are completed. Then you shall take one third and strike it with the sword all around the city, and one third you shall scatter to the wind; and I will unsheathe a sword behind them. 
EZK.5.3	Also take some of them and bind them in the edges of your robes. 
EZK.5.4	Again take some hair and throw them into the fire and burn them in the fire; from it a fire will spread to all the house of Israel.
EZK.5.5	“Thus says the Lord G
EZK.5.6	And she has rebelled against My ordinances more wickedly than the [pagan] nations and against My statutes more than the countries that are around her; for Israel has rejected My ordinances and has not walked in My statutes.’

EZK.5.11	So, as I live,’ says the Lord G
EZK.5.12	One third of you will die of virulent disease or be consumed by famine among you; one third will fall by the sword around you; and one third I will scatter to all the winds, and I will unsheathe a sword behind them.

EZK.5.14	Moreover, I will make you a desolation and a disgrace among the nations which surround you and in the sight of all who pass by. 
EZK.5.15	So it will be a disgrace, a taunt, a warning and an object of horror to the [pagan] nations who surround you when I execute judgments against you in anger and in wrath and in raging reprimands—I, the L
EZK.5.16	When I send against them the deadly arrows of hunger which were for the destruction of those whom I will send to destroy you, then I will increase the famine upon you and break your staff of bread.

EZK.7.20	As for the beauty of [gold for] ornaments, they turned it to pride and from it made the images of their repulsive things (idols) and of their vile things. Therefore I will make it an unclean thing to them. 
EZK.7.21	I will give it into the hands of strangers (Babylonians) as plunder and to the wicked of the earth as spoil, and they shall profane it. 
EZK.7.22	I will also turn My face away from them, and they will desecrate My secret treasure (the Jerusalem temple); and robbers will enter [irreverently] into it (the Holy of Holies) and violate it.
EZK.7.23	‘Prepare the chain [for imprisonment], for the land is full of bloody crimes [murders committed under the pretense of civil justice] and the city is full of violence. 
EZK.7.24	Therefore, I will bring the worst of the [Gentile] nations, and they will take possession of their houses [those of the people of Judah]; I will also silence their pride, and their holy places will be profaned.

EZK.8.2	Then I looked, and behold, a likeness [of a man] with the appearance of fire; from His 
EZK.8.3	He stretched out the form of a hand and took me by a lock of hair on my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the north gate of the inner 
EZK.8.4	And behold, the glory 
EZK.8.5	Then He said to me, “Son of man, now raise your eyes toward the north.” So I looked toward the north, and behold, to the north of the altar gate was this idol (image) of jealousy at the entrance. 
EZK.8.6	Furthermore, He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great repulsive acts which the house of Israel is committing here, to drive Me far away from My sanctuary? But you will again see greater repulsive acts.”
EZK.8.7	Then He brought me to the entrance of the courtyard; and when I looked, behold, [there was] a hole in the wall. 
EZK.8.8	He said to me, “Son of man, now dig into the wall.” And when I had dug into the wall, behold, there was an entrance. 
EZK.8.9	And He said to me, “Go in and see the wicked, repulsive acts that they are committing here.” 
EZK.8.10	So I entered and looked, and saw every kind of creeping things and beasts and loathsome things, and all the idols of the house of Israel, carved all around on the wall. 
EZK.8.11	Standing before these [images] were seventy elders of the house of Israel, and among them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan [the scribe], each man with his censer in his hand and a thick

EZK.8.14	Then He brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the L
EZK.8.15	He said to me, “Do you see this, son of man? Yet you will see still greater repulsive acts than these [that they are committing].”
EZK.8.16	So He brought me to the inner court of the L
EZK.8.17	He said to me, “Do you see this, son of man? Is it too slight a thing for the house of Judah to commit the repulsive acts which they have committed here, that they have filled the land with violence and repeatedly provoked Me to anger? And behold, they are putting the 
EZK.8.18	Therefore, I indeed will deal in wrath. My eye will have no pity nor will I spare [them]; and though they cry loudly in My ears, yet I will not listen to them.”
EZK.9.1	Then [in my vision] I heard Him cry out with a thunderous voice, saying, “Approach now, executioners of the city, each with his weapon of destruction in his hand.” 
EZK.9.2	Behold, six men [angelic beings] came from the direction of the Upper Gate, which faces north, each with his battle-axe in his hand; and among them was a

EZK.9.4	The L
EZK.9.5	But to the others I heard Him say, “Follow him [the man with the scribe’s writing case] throughout the city and strike; do not let your eyes have pity and do not spare [anyone]. 
EZK.9.6	Utterly slay old men, young men, maidens, little children, and women; but do not touch 
EZK.9.7	And He said to the executioners, “Defile the temple and fill its courtyards with the dead. Go out!” So they went out and struck down 
EZK.9.8	As they were executing them and I 
EZK.9.9	Then He said to me, “The wickedness (guilt) of the house of Israel and Judah is extremely great; the land is full of blood and the city is full of perversion 
EZK.9.10	But as for Me, My eye will have no pity, nor will I spare, but I will bring their [wicked] conduct upon their [own] heads.”
EZK.9.11	Then behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the scribe’s writing case at his side, reported, “I have done just as You have commanded me.”
EZK.10.1	Then I looked, and behold, in the expanse (firmament) that was over the heads of the cherubim there appeared something [glorious and brilliant] above them looking like a [huge] sapphire stone, formed to resemble a throne. 
EZK.10.2	And the L
EZK.10.3	Now the cherubim were standing on the right side of the temple when the man entered; and a cloud [the Shekinah glory of God] filled the inner courtyard. 
EZK.10.4	Then the glory 
EZK.10.5	And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard [even] as far as the outer courtyard, like the voice of 
EZK.10.6	It came about when He commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim,” the man entered and stood beside a wheel. 
EZK.10.7	Then a cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between [the four of] them, and took some [of it] and put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who took it and departed. 
EZK.10.8	Beneath their wings the cherubim seemed to have [something in] the form of a man’s hand.
EZK.10.9	Then I looked and behold, [there were] four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub and another wheel beside each other cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like a sparkling Tarshish stone (beryl). 
EZK.10.10	As for their appearance, all four looked alike, as if one wheel were within another wheel. 
EZK.10.11	When they moved, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went; but they followed in the direction which they faced, without turning as they went. 
EZK.10.12	Their whole body, their backs, their hands, their wings, and the wheels were full of eyes all around, even the wheels belonging to all four of them. 
EZK.10.13	Regarding the wheels [attached to them], I heard them called, “the whirling (rolling, revolving) wheels.” 
EZK.10.14	And each one had four faces: the first face was the face of the 
EZK.10.15	Then the cherubim rose upward. They are the [same four] living beings [regarded as one] that I saw by the River Chebar [in Babylonia]. 
EZK.10.16	Now when the cherubim moved, the wheels would go beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to rise from the earth, the wheels would remain beside them. 
EZK.10.17	When the cherubim stood still, the wheels would stand still; and when they rose upward, the wheels would rise with them, for the spirit of the living beings was in these [wheels].
EZK.10.18	Then the [Shekinah] glory of the L
EZK.10.19	As I looked at them, the cherubim lifted up their wings and rose up from the earth, they departed with the wheels beside them; and they stood still at the entrance of the east gate of the house of the L
EZK.10.20	These are the living beings that I saw beneath the God of Israel by the River Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim. 
EZK.10.21	Each one had four faces and each one had four wings, and beneath their wings was the form of human hands. 
EZK.10.22	As for the likeness of their faces, they were the same faces whose appearance I had seen by the River Chebar. Each one went straight forward.
EZK.11.1	Moreover, the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the gate of the L
EZK.11.2	Then the Spirit said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who devise evil and give wicked advice in this city, 
EZK.11.3	who say, ‘Is not

EZK.11.5	Then the Spirit of the L
EZK.11.6	You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled its streets with the corpses [of righteous men].” 
EZK.11.7	Therefore, thus says the Lord G
EZK.11.8	You have feared the sword; so I will bring a sword upon you,” says the Lord G
EZK.11.9	“And I will bring you out of the midst of the city and hand you over to strangers and execute judgment against you.

EZK.11.12	And you will know [without any doubt] that I am the L
EZK.11.13	Now it came about while I was prophesying, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell face downward and cried out loudly, “Alas, Lord G

EZK.11.15	“Son of man, your brothers, your relatives, your fellow exiles and the whole house of Israel, all of them, are those to whom the [present] inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, ‘Go far away from the L

EZK.11.18	When they return there, they will remove from it all [traces of] its detestable things and all its repulsive things (remnants of paganism). 
EZK.11.19	And I will give them one heart [a new heart], and put a new spirit within them. I will take from them the heart of stone, and will give them a heart of flesh [that is responsive to My touch], 
EZK.11.20	that they may walk in My statutes and keep My ordinances and do them. Then they shall be My people, and I will be their God. 
EZK.11.21	But as for those whose heart longs for

EZK.11.23	Then the glory 
EZK.11.24	And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God to the exiles in Chaldea (Babylonia). Then the vision that I had seen left me. 
EZK.11.25	Then I told the exiles everything that the L
EZK.12.1	The word of the L
EZK.12.2	“Son of man, you live among a rebellious house, who have eyes to see but do not see, who have ears to hear but do not hear; for they are a rebellious people. 
EZK.12.3	Therefore, son of man, prepare your belongings for exile, and move into exile during the day when they will see you; even go into exile from your place to another place as they watch. Perhaps they will understand even though they are a rebellious people. 
EZK.12.4	Bring your 
EZK.12.5	Dig through the wall as they watch and go out through the hole. 
EZK.12.6	As they look on, load 
EZK.12.7	I did as I had been commanded. I brought out my provisions 
EZK.12.8	In the morning the word of the L
EZK.12.9	“Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, asked you, ‘What you are doing?’ 
EZK.12.10	Say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord G
EZK.12.11	Say, ‘I am a sign to you. As I have done, so it will be done to them; they will go into exile, into captivity.’ 
EZK.12.12	The prince who is among them will load

EZK.13.11	so tell those who plaster it with whitewash, that it will fall! A flooding rain [of judgment] will come, and you, O [great] hailstones, will fall; and a violent wind will tear the wall apart. 
EZK.13.12	Behold, when the wall has fallen, will you not be asked, ‘Where is the coating with which you [prophets] plastered it?’ ” 
EZK.13.13	Therefore, thus says the Lord G
EZK.13.14	So I will tear down the wall which you have plastered with whitewash and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundations will be exposed; when it falls, you will perish in its midst. And you shall know 
EZK.13.15	Thus I will expend My wrath on the wall and on those who have plastered it with whitewash and I will say to you, ‘The wall is gone and its plasterers are gone,

EZK.14.23	Then they will reassure

EZK.15.4	If it has been thrown into the fire for fuel, and the fire has consumed both of its ends and the middle section has been charred, is it suitable 
EZK.15.5	Notice this, even when it was complete, it was not useful 
EZK.15.6	Therefore, thus says the Lord G

EZK.15.8	I will make the land desolate (ruined, deserted), because they have acted unfaithfully [through their idolatry],’ says the Lord G

EZK.16.3	and say, ‘Thus says the Lord G
EZK.16.4	And as for your birth, on the day you were born your navel cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water for cleansing, nor were you rubbed with salt or even wrapped in cloths. 
EZK.16.5	No eye looked with pity on you to do any of these things for you, to have compassion on you; but you were thrown out in the open field, for you were loathed on the day that you were born.
EZK.16.6	“When I passed by you and saw you squirming in your [newborn] blood, I said to you while you were there in your blood, ‘Live!’ Yes, I said to you while you were there in your blood, ‘Live!’ 
EZK.16.7	I made you (Israel) multiply like plants [which grow] in the field, and you grew up and became tall and you reached the age for [wearing] fine jewelry; your breasts were formed and your hair had grown, yet you were naked and bare.
EZK.16.8	“Then I passed by you [again] and looked on you; behold, you were maturing 
EZK.16.9	“Then I washed you with water; yes, I [thoroughly] washed away from you the [clinging] blood and anointed you with oil. 
EZK.16.10	I also clothed you with embroidered cloth and put sandals of

EZK.16.12	I also put a ring in your nostril and earrings in your ears and a beautiful crown on your head. 
EZK.16.13	Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your dress was [made] of fine linen and silk and embroidered cloth. You ate fine flour and honey and oil; so you were extremely beautiful and you advanced 
EZK.16.14	Then your fame went out among the nations on account of your beauty, for it was perfect because of My majesty 
EZK.16.15	“But you trusted in 
EZK.16.16	You took some of your clothes and made for yourself [decorated] high places 
EZK.16.17	You also took your beautiful jewels 
EZK.16.18	and you took your embroidered clothing and covered them, and offered My oil and My incense before them. 
EZK.16.19	Also My bread which I gave you, [made from the] fine flour and oil and honey with which I fed you, you even offered it before idols [no better than cow dung] as a sweet 
EZK.16.20	“Moreover, you took your sons and your daughters whom you had borne to Me, and you destroyed them as sacrifices [to your man-made gods]. Were your gross immoralities so small a matter? 
EZK.16.21	You slaughtered My children and offered them up to [worthless] idols, forcing them to pass through the [hideousness of the] fire. 
EZK.16.22	And in all your repulsive acts and prostitutions (idolatrous immoralities) you did not [pause to] remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, squirming in your [newborn] blood.
EZK.16.23	“Then it came about after all your wickedness (‘Woe, woe to you!’ says the Lord G
EZK.16.24	that you built yourself an 
EZK.16.25	At the beginning of every street you built your high place and made your beauty repulsive; and you offered your body to every passer-by and multiplied your obscene immorality. 
EZK.16.26	You also prostituted yourself with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors [by embracing their pagan rituals], and you multiplied your obscene immorality to provoke Me to anger. 
EZK.16.27	Behold now [listen very carefully], I have stretched out My hand against you, reduced your portion, and handed you over to the desire of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your infamous behavior. 
EZK.16.28	You prostituted yourself with the Assyrians because you were not satisfied; you prostituted yourself with them and still were not satisfied. 
EZK.16.29	Moreover, you increased your obscene immorality with the land of tradesmen, Chaldea (Babylonia), and yet even with this you were not satisfied.” ’ ”
EZK.16.30	“How weakened by longing 
EZK.16.31	When you built your shrine altar for prostitution at the beginning of every street and made your high place in every public square, you were not like a prostitute because you refused payment. 
EZK.16.32	You adulterous wife, who welcomes 
EZK.16.33	Men give gifts to all prostitutes, but you give your gifts to all your lovers, bribing the pagan nations to come to you [as allies] from every direction for your obscene immoralities. 
EZK.16.34	And you are different from other [unfaithful] women in your promiscuity, in that no one follows you to lure you into prostitution, and because you give money and no money is given you; in this way you are different.”
EZK.16.35	Therefore, O prostitute [Israel], hear the word of the L
EZK.16.36	Thus says the Lord G
EZK.16.37	therefore, listen, I will gather all your lovers (pagan allies) with whom you took pleasure, and all those whom you loved with all those whom you hated; I will even gather them against you from every direction and will expose your nakedness to them that they may see all your nakedness [making you, Israel, an object of loathing and of mockery, a spectacle among the nations]. 
EZK.16.38	And I [the Lord G
EZK.16.39	I will also hand you over to your lovers, and they will tear down your shrines, demolish your high places, strip you of your clothing, take away your jewels, and they will leave you naked and bare. 
EZK.16.40	They will also incite a crowd against you and they will stone you and slaughter you with their swords. 
EZK.16.41	They will burn down your houses with fire and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women (Gentile nations). Then I will make you cease your prostitution, and you will no longer hire your lovers. 
EZK.16.42	So I will calm My wrath toward you and My jealousy [resulting from being denied what is rightfully and uniquely mine] will turn away from you; I will be pacified and no longer angry. 
EZK.16.43	Because you have not remembered the days of your youth but have enraged Me with all these things, therefore, I in turn will bring your conduct down on your own head,” says the Lord G
EZK.16.44	“Behold, everyone who uses proverbs will use this proverb against you: ‘Like mother, like daughter.’ 
EZK.16.45	You are the daughter of your mother, who loathed her husband and her children. You are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children. Your [spiritual] mother was a Hittite and your [spiritual] father an Amorite. 
EZK.16.46	Now your older sister is Samaria, she with her daughters (outlying cities) who live north of you; and your younger sister is Sodom, she with her daughters who live south of you. 
EZK.16.47	Yet you have not merely walked in their ways or behaved in accordance with their pagan practices; but, as if that were too little, you [soon] acted more corruptly in all your ways than they. 
EZK.16.48	As I live,” says the Lord G
EZK.16.49	Behold, this was the sin of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters (outlying cities) had arrogance, abundant food, and careless ease, but she did not help the poor and needy. 
EZK.16.50	They were haughty and committed repulsive acts before Me; therefore I removed them when I saw it. 
EZK.16.51	Furthermore, Samaria did not commit half of your sins, but you have greatly increased your repulsive acts more than they. So you have made your [wicked] sisters [Samaria and Sodom] appear righteous 
EZK.16.52	Also bear your disgrace [as punishment], having made judgment favorable for your sisters, for [you virtually absolved them] because of your sins in which you behaved more repulsively than they; they are more in the right than you. Yes, be ashamed and bear your disgrace, for you made your [pagan] sisters seem righteous.
EZK.16.53	“Nevertheless, I will restore them [again] from their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters (outlying cities), the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and along with them [I will restore you from] your own captivity [in the day of the Lord G
EZK.16.54	so that you [Judah] will bear your humiliation 
EZK.16.55	Your sisters, Sodom and her daughters and Samaria and her daughters will return to their former state; and you and your daughters will return to your former state. 
EZK.16.56	For [the name of] your sister Sodom was not mentioned by you [except as a byword] in the day of your pride [when David ruled], 
EZK.16.57	before your [own] wickedness was uncovered. Now you have become an object of reproach 
EZK.16.58	You have borne [the penalty of] your lewdness and your repulsive acts,” says the L
EZK.16.59	Yes, thus says the Lord G
EZK.16.60	“Nevertheless, I will remember [with compassion] My covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you. 
EZK.16.61	Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, both your older and your younger; I will give them to you as daughters, but not because of your covenant [with Me]. 
EZK.16.62	And I will establish My covenant with you, and you will know [without any doubt] that I am the L
EZK.16.63	so that you may remember [in detail] and be ashamed and never open your mouth again because of your humiliation, when I have forgiven you for all that you have done,” says the Lord G

EZK.17.14	so that the kingdom would be in subjection, unable to restore itself 
EZK.17.15	But Zedekiah rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar by sending his ambassadors to Egypt so that they might give him horses and many troops. Will he succeed? Will he who does such things escape? Can he indeed break the covenant [with Babylon] and [still] escape? 
EZK.17.16	As I live,’ says the Lord G
EZK.17.17	Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company will not help him in the war, when they (the Babylonians) put up ramps and build siege walls to destroy many lives. 
EZK.17.18	Now Zedekiah dishonored the oath by breaking the covenant, and behold, he gave his hand 
EZK.17.19	Therefore, thus says the Lord G
EZK.17.20	I will spread My net over him, and he will be caught in My snare; and I will bring him to Babylon and will enter into judgment with him there for his treason which he has committed against Me.

EZK.18.2	But the children’s teeth are set on edge’?
EZK.18.3	As I live,” says the Lord G
EZK.18.4	Behold (pay close attention), all souls are Mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is Mine. The soul who sins will die.
EZK.18.5	“But if a man is righteous (keeps the law) and practices justice and righteousness, 
EZK.18.6	and does not eat [at the pagan shrines] on the mountains or raise his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, or defile his neighbor’s wife or approach a woman during her [monthly] time of impurity— 
EZK.18.7	if a man does not oppress anyone, but restores to the debtor his pledge, does not commit robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing, 
EZK.18.8	if he 
EZK.18.9	if he walks in My statutes and [keeps] My ordinances so as to act with integrity; [then] he is [truly] righteous and shall certainly live,” says the Lord G
EZK.18.10	“If he is the father of a violent son who sheds blood, and who does any of these things to a brother 
EZK.18.11	(though the father did not do any of these things), that is, the son even eats [the food set before idols] at the mountain 
EZK.18.12	oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not restore [to the debtor] his pledge, but raises his eyes to the idols, and commits repulsive acts, 
EZK.18.13	and charges interest and takes [a percentage of] increase on what he has loaned; will he then live? He will not live! He has done all these disgusting things, he shall surely be put to death; his blood will be on his own head.
EZK.18.14	“Now behold, if this [wicked] man has a son who has observed all the sins which his father committed, and considers [thoughtfully what he has observed] and does not do like his father: 
EZK.18.15	He does not eat [food set before idols] at the mountain 
EZK.18.16	or oppress anyone, or take anything in pledge, or commit robbery, but he gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing, 
EZK.18.17	he keeps his hand from [oppressing] the poor, does not receive interest or increase [from the needy], but executes My ordinances and walks in My statutes; he shall not die for the sin (guilt) of his father; he shall certainly live. 
EZK.18.18	As for his father, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother, and did that which is not good among his people, behold, he shall die for his sin.
EZK.18.19	“Yet do you say, ‘Why should the son not bear the punishment for the father’s sin?’ When the son has practiced justice and righteousness and has kept all My statutes and has done them, he shall certainly live. 
EZK.18.20	The person who sins [is the one that] will die. The son will not bear the punishment for the sin of the father, nor will the father bear the punishment for the sin of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be on himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be on himself.
EZK.18.21	“But if the wicked man turns [away] from all his sins which he has committed and keeps all My statutes and practices justice and righteousness, he shall certainly live; he shall not die. 
EZK.18.22	All of his transgressions which he has committed will not be remembered against him; because of his righteousness which he has practiced [for his moral and spiritual integrity in every area and relationship], he will live. 
EZK.18.23	Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked,” says the Lord G
EZK.18.24	“But when the righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits sin and acts in accordance with all the repulsive things that the wicked man does, will he live? All of his righteous deeds which he has done will not be remembered because of the treachery that he has committed and for his sin which he has committed; for them he shall die. 
EZK.18.25	Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not right.’ Hear now, O house of Israel! Is My way not right? Is it not your ways that are not right? 
EZK.18.26	When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits sin and dies because of it, it is for his sin which he has committed that he dies. 
EZK.18.27	Again, when a wicked man turns away from his wickedness which he has committed and practices justice and righteousness, he will save his life. 
EZK.18.28	Because he considered and turned away from all the transgressions which he had committed, he shall certainly live; he shall not die. 
EZK.18.29	Yet the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the Lord is not right!’ O house of Israel, are My ways not right? Is it not your ways that are not right?
EZK.18.30	“Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, each one in accordance with his conduct,” says the Lord G
EZK.18.31	Cast away from you all your transgressions which you have committed [against Me], and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! For why should you die, O house of Israel? 
EZK.18.32	For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone who dies,” says the Lord G

EZK.20.3	“Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord G
EZK.20.4	Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? Then make them know [accurately] 
EZK.20.5	and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord G
EZK.20.6	on that day I swore to them to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had selected for them, [plentiful and] 
EZK.20.7	Then I said to them, ‘Let every man throw away the detestable things on which he feasts his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am the L
EZK.20.8	But they rebelled against Me and were not willing to listen to Me; they did not throw away the detestable things on which they feasted their eyes, nor did they 
EZK.20.8	“
EZK.20.9	But I acted for My Name’s sake, that it would not be profaned in the sight of the [pagan] nations among whom they lived, in whose sight I made Myself known to them by bringing them out of the land of Egypt. 
EZK.20.10	So I made them leave the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness. 
EZK.20.11	I gave them My statutes and explained My ordinances to them, which, if a man keeps, he will live. 
EZK.20.12	Also I gave them My Sabbaths to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know [without any doubt] that I am the L
EZK.20.13	But the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness. They did not walk in My statutes and they despised 
EZK.20.14	But I acted for My Name’s sake, that it would not be profaned in the sight of the [pagan] nations in whose sight I had brought them out [of slavery]. 
EZK.20.15	I also swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, [a land of plenty] 
EZK.20.16	because they rejected My ordinances, and as for My statutes, they did not walk in them; they even profaned My Sabbaths, for their heart continually went after their [worthless] idols. 
EZK.20.17	Yet My eye [looked on them with compassion and] spared them instead of destroying them, and I did not annihilate them in the wilderness.
EZK.20.18	“But I said to their children in the wilderness, ‘Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers nor observe their ordinances nor defile yourselves with their idols. 
EZK.20.19	I am the L
EZK.20.20	Sanctify My Sabbaths 
EZK.20.21	Yet the children rebelled against Me; they did not walk in My statutes, nor were they careful to observe My ordinances, which, if a man keeps, he will live; they profaned My Sabbaths. Then I decided to pour out My wrath on them and finish My anger against them in the wilderness. 
EZK.20.22	Yet I withdrew My hand and acted for My Name’s sake, that it would not be profaned in the sight of the [pagan] nations in whose sight I had brought them out [of slavery]. 
EZK.20.23	Moreover, I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the [Gentile] nations and disperse them among the countries, 
EZK.20.24	because they had not observed My ordinances, but had [dishonored and] rejected My statutes and had profaned My Sabbaths, and set their eyes on the [man-made] idols of their fathers. 
EZK.20.25	[Therefore] I also gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances by which they could not live; 
EZK.20.26	and I pronounced them unclean because of their offerings [to their idols], in that they made all their firstborn pass through 
EZK.20.27	“Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord G
EZK.20.28	For when I had brought them into the land which I swore to give to them, they saw every high hill and every dark 
EZK.20.29	Then I said to them, ‘What is the high place to which you go?’ So the name of it is called Bamah (High Place) to this day.” ’ 
EZK.20.30	Therefore, say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord G
EZK.20.31	When you offer your gifts, when you make your sons pass through the fire, you are defiling yourselves with all your idols to this day. And shall I be asked by you [for an oracle], O house of Israel? As I live,” says the Lord G
EZK.20.32	What comes into your mind will never happen, when you say, ‘We will be like the [pagan] nations, like the tribes of the [Gentile] countries, serving [idols made of] wood and stone.’
EZK.20.33	“As I live,” says the Lord G
EZK.20.34	I will bring you out from the peoples and will gather you from the countries in which you are scattered, with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out; 
EZK.20.35	and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will enter into judgment with you 
EZK.20.36	As I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment 
EZK.20.37	“I will make you pass under the rod [as the shepherd does with his sheep when he counts them, and I will count you as Mine and constrain you] and bring you into the bond of the covenant [to which you are permanently bound]. 
EZK.20.38	And I will separate from you the rebels and those who transgress against Me; I will bring them out of the land where they temporarily live, but they will not enter the land of Israel. Thus you will know [without any doubt] that I am the L
EZK.20.39	“As for you, O house of Israel,” thus says the Lord G
EZK.20.40	For on My holy mountain, on the high mountain of Israel (Zion),” says the Lord G
EZK.20.41	I will accept you [graciously] as a pleasant 
EZK.20.42	And you will know [without any doubt] that I am the L
EZK.20.43	There you will remember your ways and all your deeds with which you have defiled yourselves; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight because of all your evil deeds which you have done. 
EZK.20.44	And you will know [without any doubt] that I am the L
EZK.20.45	Now the word of the L
EZK.20.46	“Son of man, set your face toward Teman, and speak out against the south and prophesy against the forest land of the Negev (the South), 
EZK.20.47	and say to the forest of the Negev, ‘Hear the word of the L

EZK.21.19	“As for you, son of man, mark out two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come, both starting from the same land. And make a signpost; place it at the head of the way to the city. 
EZK.21.20	You shall point out a way for the [Babylonian] sword to come to Rabbah [the capital] of the sons of Ammon, and to Judah into fortified Jerusalem. 
EZK.21.21	For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way, at the fork of the two ways, to use divination. He shakes the arrows, he consults the teraphim (household idols), he looks at the liver [of an animal for an omen]. 
EZK.21.22	In his right hand is the lot marked for Jerusalem: to set battering rams, to open the mouth calling for destruction, to lift up the voice with a war cry, to set battering rams against the gates, to put up assault ramps, and to build siege walls. 
EZK.21.23	It will seem like a false divination in their eyes, those who have sworn solemn oaths [of allegiance to Nebuchadnezzar]. But he will remind them of their guilt [by rebelling and violating their oath], that they may be caught.
EZK.21.24	“Therefore, thus says the Lord G
EZK.21.25	And you, O dishonored and wicked one [Zedekiah], the prince of Israel, whose day has come, whose time of final punishment is here,’

EZK.21.30	Return the sword to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin (birth), I will judge you. 
EZK.21.31	I will pour out My indignation on you [sons of Ammon]; I will blow on you with the fire of My wrath, and I will place you in the hand of brutal men, skilled in destruction.

Thus you have caused your day [of judgment and punishment] to approach and have arrived at [the completion of] your years; therefore, I have made you an object of scorn to the [pagan] nations and a thing to be mocked by all countries. 
EZK.22.5	Those who are near and those who are far from you will mock you, you [infamous one] of ill repute, full of turmoil.
EZK.22.6	“Behold, the princes of Israel, every one according to his power, have been intending to shed blood in you. 
EZK.22.7	In you they have treated father and mother lightly. They have oppressed the stranger among you; and in your presence they have wronged the fatherless and the widow. 
EZK.22.8	You have despised

EZK.22.11	In you one has committed a shameful act with his neighbor’s wife, another has lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law, and another has violated his sister, his father’s daughter. 
EZK.22.12	In you they have accepted bribes to shed blood; you have taken [forbidden] interest and [a percentage of] profits, and you have injured your neighbors for gain by oppression

EZK.22.20	As they gather silver and bronze and iron and lead and tin into the furnace to blow fire on it in order to melt it, so I will gather you in My anger and in My wrath, and I will put you there and melt you. 
EZK.22.21	I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of My wrath, and you will be melted in the midst of it.

EZK.22.25	There is a conspiracy of her [false] prophets in her midst, like a roaring lion tearing the prey. They have devoured [human] life; they have taken [in their greed] treasure and precious things; they have made many widows among her. 
EZK.22.26	Her priests have done violence to My law and have profaned My holy things. They have made no distinction between the holy (sacred) and the profane (secular), they have not taught [people] the difference between the unclean and the clean; and they hide their eyes from My Sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.

EZK.23.1	The word of the L
EZK.23.2	“Son of man, there were two women (Israel and Judah), the daughters of one mother (the united kingdom); 
EZK.23.3	and they prostituted themselves in Egypt. From their youth they were grossly immoral; in that place their breasts were embraced and their virgin bosom was grasped. 
EZK.23.4	Their names were Oholah the elder and Oholibah her sister, and they became Mine and they gave birth to sons and daughters. And as for [the identity of] their names, Oholah is Samaria (capital city of 
EZK.23.5	“Oholah played the prostitute while she was Mine; and she adored 
EZK.23.6	who were clothed in purple, governors and officials, all of them attractive young men, horsemen riding on horses.

EZK.23.8	She did not 
EZK.23.9	Therefore, I placed her in the hand of her lovers (allies), into the hand of the Assyrians whom she adored. 
EZK.23.10	They uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters and they killed her with the sword. So she became 
EZK.23.11	“Now her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more corrupt in her lust than she, and her acts of prostitution were more [wanton] than the immoralities of her sister. 
EZK.23.12	She lusted after the Assyrians—governors and officials, her neighbors, magnificently clothed, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men. 
EZK.23.13	I saw that she had defiled herself; they both 
EZK.23.14	But Oholibah carried her depravity further, for she saw men pictured on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans (Babylonians) sketched 
EZK.23.15	girded with belts on their 
EZK.23.16	When she saw [the sketches of] them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea. 
EZK.23.17	The Babylonians came to her to the bed of love and they defiled her with their evil desire; and when she had been defiled by them, she (Jerusalem) broke the relationship 
EZK.23.18	So she flaunted her acts of prostitution and exposed her nakedness; then I became disgusted with her [and turned away], as I had become disgusted with her sister [and turned away]. 
EZK.23.19	Yet she multiplied her depravities, remembering the days of her youth, when she was actively immoral in the land of Egypt. 
EZK.23.20	For she lusted after her lovers [there], whose flesh is like the flesh of donkeys and whose issue is like the issue of horses. 
EZK.23.21	Thus you longed for the lewdness 
EZK.23.22	“Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the Lord G
EZK.23.23	the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, desirable young men, governors and officials all of them, princes, officers and men of renown, all of them riding on horses. 
EZK.23.24	They will come against you with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and with a company of people (infantry) who will array themselves against you on every side with large shield and small, and helmet; and I will commit the judgment 
EZK.23.25	I will set My jealous indignation against you [demanding what is rightfully and uniquely mine], and they will deal with you in fury. They will remove your nose and your ears, and your survivors will fall by the sword. They will take your sons and your daughters; and the survivors will be devoured by the fire. 
EZK.23.26	They will also strip you (Judah) of your clothes and take away your beautiful jewels. 
EZK.23.27	Thus I will put an end to your lewdness and your prostitution 
EZK.23.28	For thus says the Lord G
EZK.23.29	They will deal with you in hatred, take all your property, and leave you naked and bare. And the nakedness of your depravity will be uncovered, both your lewdness and your obscene practices. 
EZK.23.30	These things will be done to you because you have prostituted yourself with the [Gentile] nations, because you have defiled yourself with their idols. 
EZK.23.31	You have walked in the way of your sister (Samaria); therefore I will give her cup [of judgment] into your hand.’ 
EZK.23.32	Thus says the Lord G
EZK.23.32	‘You will drink your sister’s cup,
EZK.23.32	Which is deep and wide [and filled to the brim].
EZK.23.32	You shall be laughed at and derided;
EZK.23.32	It contains much [too much to endure].
EZK.23.33	You shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow,
EZK.23.33	With the cup of horror and desolation,
EZK.23.33	With the cup of your sister Samaria.
EZK.23.34	You will drink it and drain it,
EZK.23.34	Then you will gnaw its fragments
EZK.23.34	And tear your breasts;
EZK.23.34	for I have spoken,’ says the Lord G

EZK.23.37	For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands. They have committed adultery [against Me] with their idols and have even forced their sons, whom they bore to Me, to pass through the fire as [an offering of] food to them (idols). 
EZK.23.38	Moreover, they have done this to Me: they have defiled My sanctuary on the same day [of their idolatries] and have profaned My Sabbaths. 
EZK.23.39	For when they had killed their children [as offerings] to their idols, then they came the same day to My sanctuary to profane it [by daring to offer a sacrifice there also]. And behold, this they did within My house.
EZK.23.40	“Furthermore, you have even sent a messenger for men to come from far away; and behold, they came—those for whom you bathed, painted your eyes, and decorated yourself with ornaments; 
EZK.23.41	and you sat on a splendid couch with a table arranged before it on which you had set My incense and My oil. 
EZK.23.42	The sound of a carefree crowd was with her; and drunkards were brought from the wilderness with men of a common sort, who put bracelets on the hands of the women (both sisters) and beautiful crowns on their heads.
EZK.23.43	“Then I said concerning the one (Oholah) worn out by adulteries, ‘Will they now commit adultery with her when she is like this?’ 
EZK.23.44	But they committed adultery with her as they would with a prostitute. So they went in to Oholah (Israel) and to Oholibah (Judah), the lewd women. 
EZK.23.45	And they, righteous men, will judge 
EZK.23.46	“For thus says the Lord G
EZK.23.47	And the horde will stone them with stones and cut them down with their swords; they will kill their sons and their daughters and burn down their houses with fire. 
EZK.23.48	Thus I will make lewdness cease from the land, that all women may be admonished 
EZK.23.49	Thus your lewdness will be repaid to you, and you will suffer the penalty for your [sinful] idolatry; and you will know [without any doubt] that I am the Lord G
EZK.24.1	Again in the ninth year [of King Jehoiachin’s captivity by Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon], in the tenth month, on the tenth [day] of the month, the word of the L
EZK.24.2	“Son of man, record the name of the day, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day.

EZK.24.6	Without making any choice.
EZK.24.7	For her blood [that she has shed] remains in her midst;
EZK.24.7	She put it on the bare rock;
EZK.24.7	She did not pour it on the ground
EZK.24.7	To cover it with dust.
EZK.24.8	That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance,
EZK.24.8	I have put her blood [guilt for her children sacrificed to Molech] on the bare rock,
EZK.24.8	That it may not be covered.”
EZK.24.9	Therefore, thus says the Lord G
EZK.24.9	“Woe to the bloody city!
EZK.24.9	I will also make the pile [of wood] high.

EZK.24.10	And mix in the spices,
EZK.24.10	And let the bones be burned.
EZK.24.11	Then set the empty pot (Jerusalem) back on the coals
EZK.24.11	So that it may be hot
EZK.24.11	And its bronze may glow
EZK.24.11	And its filthiness may be melted
EZK.24.11	And its rust (scum) may be consumed.

EZK.24.13	Until I have satisfied My wrath against you.

EZK.24.18	So I spoke to the people in the morning, and 
EZK.24.19	The people said to me, “These things that you are doing—tell us, what do they mean for us?” 
EZK.24.20	Then I answered them, “The word of the L

EZK.24.24	So Ezekiel will be a sign to you; in accordance with all that he has done you will do. And when this [destruction of the temple] comes, then you will know [without any doubt] that I am the Lord G

EZK.33.13	When I say to the righteous that he will most certainly live, and he trusts in his [previous acts of] righteousness [to save him] and commits injustice, none of his righteous deeds will be remembered; but he will die for his injustice that he committed.

EZK.38.10	‘Thus says the Lord G
EZK.38.11	and you will say, ‘I will go up against an open country; I will come against those who are at rest

Have you assembled your hordes [of fighting men] to seize plunder, to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take great spoil?’ ” ’
EZK.38.14	“Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog, ‘Thus says the Lord G

EZK.39.14	“They will elect men who will constantly go through the land, [men commissioned] to bury those who were passing through, those bodies that lie unburied on the surface of the ground, in order to cleanse it. At the end of seven months they will do a search. 
EZK.39.15	As those who pass through the land pass through and anyone sees a human bone, he will set up a marker beside it, until the buriers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon-gog.

EZK.39.17	“As for you, son of man, thus says the Lord G
EZK.39.18	You will eat the flesh of mighty men and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, 
EZK.39.19	So you will eat fat until you are filled and drink blood till you are drunk, at the sacrificial feast which I have prepared for you.

So I gave them into the hand of their enemies, and they all fell [into captivity or were killed] by [the power of] the sword. 
EZK.39.24	I dealt with them in accordance with their uncleanness and their transgressions, and I hid My face from them.” ’ ”
EZK.39.25	Therefore thus says the Lord G
EZK.39.26	They will forget their disgrace and all their treachery (unfaithfulness) which they perpetuated against Me, when they live securely in their own land and there is no one who makes them afraid. 
EZK.39.27	When I bring them back from the nations and gather them out of their enemies’ lands, then I shall show Myself holy [and My justice and holiness will be vindicated] through them in the sight of many nations.

EZK.40.2	In the visions of God He brought me to the land of Israel and set me down on a very high mountain, on the south side of which 
EZK.40.3	So He brought me there; and behold, there was a man [an angel] whose appearance was like bronze, with a line of flax and a measuring 
EZK.40.4	The man said to me, “Son of man, look with your eyes and hear with your ears and set your heart on all that I am going to show you; for you have been brought here that I may show it to you. Declare to the house of Israel all that you see.”
EZK.40.5	And behold, there was a wall all around the outside [area] of the temple (house) [of the L
EZK.40.6	Then he went to the gate which faced the east and went up its [seven] steps and measured the threshold of the gate, one rod in width; and the other threshold [of the gate inside the thick wall] was one rod in width. 
EZK.40.7	The guardroom was one rod long and one rod wide, and [the space] between the guardrooms was five cubits. And the threshold of the gate by the porch (portico) of the gate facing inward was one rod. 
EZK.40.8	He also measured the porch of the gate facing inward [toward the temple of the L

EZK.40.10	There were three guardrooms on each side of the gate toward the east; the three were the same size, and the side pillars on each side measured the same. 
EZK.40.11	And he measured the width of the 
EZK.40.12	On each side a border (barrier wall) one cubit wide stood in front of the guardrooms on each side; and the guardrooms were six cubits 
EZK.40.13	He measured the gate from the roof of one guardroom to the roof of the other, a width of twenty-five cubits from one door to the opposite door. 
EZK.40.14	He made [the measurement of] the side pillars sixty cubits 
EZK.40.15	From the front of the entrance gate [on the outside] to the front of the inner porch (portico) of the gate [the distance] was fifty cubits. 
EZK.40.16	 shuttered windows 
EZK.40.17	Then he brought me into the outer courtyard, and behold, 
EZK.40.18	The pavement (
EZK.40.19	Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gate to the front of the exterior of the inner court, a hundred cubits [both] on the east and on the north.
EZK.40.20	And as for the gate of the outer courtyard which faced the north he measured [both] its length and its width. 
EZK.40.21	Its guardrooms, three on each side, and its side pillars and its porches had the same measurement as the first gate. Its length was fifty cubits and the width was twenty-five cubits. 
EZK.40.22	Its windows and its porches and its palm tree decorations had the same measurements as the gate that faced toward the east. It was reached by going up seven steps, and its porch was in front of them. 
EZK.40.23	The inner courtyard had a gate opposite the gate on the north as well as 
EZK.40.24	Then he led me toward the south, and behold, there was a gate toward the south; and he measured its side pillars and its porches, 
EZK.40.25	The gate and its porches had windows all around like those windows [in the other gateways]; the length was fifty cubits and the width was twenty-five cubits. 
EZK.40.26	 seven steps going up to the gate, and its porches were in front of them; and it had palm tree decorations [carved] on its side pillars, one on each side. 
EZK.40.27	The inner courtyard had a gate toward the south; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south, a hundred cubits.
EZK.40.28	Then the man (angel) brought me to the inner courtyard by the south gate; and he measured the south gate according to those same measurements. 
EZK.40.29	Its guardrooms also, its side pillars and its porches 
EZK.40.30	 porches all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide. 
EZK.40.31	Its porches faced the outer courtyard; and palm tree decorations were [carved] on its side pillars, and its stairway had eight steps.
EZK.40.32	He brought me into the inner courtyard toward the east, and he measured the gate; it measured the same as the others. 
EZK.40.33	Its guardrooms also, its side pillars and its porches measured the same as the others. The gate and its porches had windows all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. 
EZK.40.34	Its porches faced the outer courtyard; and palm tree decorations were [carved] on either side of its side pillars, and its stairway had eight steps.
EZK.40.35	Then he brought me to the north gate and he measured it; the measurements were the same as those of the other gates, 
EZK.40.36	with its guardrooms, its side pillars, its porches; and the gate had windows all around. The length was fifty cubits and the width was twenty-five cubits. 
EZK.40.37	Its side pillars faced the outer courtyard, and palm tree decorations were [carved] on them on either side. And its stairway had eight steps.
EZK.40.38	A chamber with its doorway was by the side pillars of the gates; there the burnt offering was to be washed. 
EZK.40.39	In the porch (portico) of the gate were two tables on each side, on which to slaughter the burnt offering, the sin offering and the guilt offering. 
EZK.40.40	On the outer 
EZK.40.41	Four tables were on each 
EZK.40.42	Moreover, 
EZK.40.43	The double hooks, one hand width in length were installed in the 
EZK.40.44	From the outside to the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner courtyard, 
EZK.40.45	He [who was guiding me] said to me, “This is the chamber which faces toward the south; it is for the priests who have the responsibility 
EZK.40.46	but the chamber which faces toward the north is for the priests who have the responsibility 
EZK.40.47	He measured the courtyard, a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide, a 
EZK.40.48	Then he brought me to the porch of the temple, and he measured each side pillar of the porch, five cubits on each side; and the width of the gate was three cubits on each side. 
EZK.40.49	The length of the porch was twenty cubits and the width eleven cubits; and at the stairway by which it was ascended, there were [two] columns beside the side pillars, one on each side [of the entrance].
EZK.41.1	Then he (the angel) brought me to the nave (outer sanctuary) and measured the side pillars; six cubits wide on each side was the width of the 
EZK.41.2	The width of the entrance was ten cubits and the 
EZK.41.3	Then he went inside [the inner sanctuary] and measured each side pillar of the doorway, two cubits, and the doorway, six cubits [high], and the width of the doorway, seven cubits. 
EZK.41.4	He measured the length [of the interior of the inner sanctuary], twenty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits, 
EZK.41.5	Then he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits [thick, to accommodate side chambers]; and the width of every side chamber, four cubits, all around the temple on every side. 
EZK.41.6	The side chambers were three stories [high], one above another, and thirty chambers in each story; and the side chambers extended to the wall which stood on their inward side all around, so that they would be attached, but not attached to the wall of the temple 
EZK.41.7	The side chambers became wider at each successive level as they encompassed the temple. Because the structure surrounding the temple went higher by stages on all sides of the temple, for that reason the width of the temple 
EZK.41.8	I also saw that the temple (house) had a raised platform all around it; the foundations of the side chambers 
EZK.41.9	The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits. But the free space between the side chambers belonging to the temple 
EZK.41.10	and the 
EZK.41.11	The doorways of the side chambers toward the free space were one doorway toward the north and another doorway toward the south; and the width of the free space was five cubits all around.
EZK.41.12	The building that was in front of the separate area on the side toward the west was seventy cubits wide; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length was ninety cubits.
EZK.41.13	Then he measured the temple, a hundred cubits long; the separate area and the building with its walls were also a hundred cubits long. 
EZK.41.14	Also the width of the front of the temple and the separate areas along the east 
EZK.41.15	He (the angel) measured the length of the building along the front of the separate area behind it, with a gallery on each side, a hundred cubits; he also 
EZK.41.16	The thresholds, the latticed windows, and the galleries all around their three stories, opposite the threshold, were paneled with wood all around, and from the ground to the windows (but the windows were covered), 
EZK.41.17	over the entrance, and to the inner 
EZK.41.18	It was 
EZK.41.19	so that the face of a man was toward the palm decoration on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm decoration on the other side. It was carved [this way] on the entire house (temple) all around. 
EZK.41.20	From the 
EZK.41.21	The doorposts of the nave were square; as for the front of the sanctuary, the appearance of one doorpost was like that of the other. 
EZK.41.22	The 
EZK.41.23	The nave (Holy Place) and the sanctuary (Holy of Holies) each had a double door. 
EZK.41.24	Each of the doors had two leaves, two swinging (folding) leaves; two 
EZK.41.25	And there were carved on them, on the doors of the nave, cherubim and palm decorations like those carved on the walls; and 
EZK.41.26	 latticed windows and palm decorations on one side and on the other, on the sides of the porch. Thus were the side chambers and the 
EZK.42.1	Then he (the angel) brought me out into the outer courtyard, toward the north; and he led me to the [attached] chamber which was opposite the separate area and opposite the building to the north. 
EZK.42.2	Along the length, one hundred cubits, was the north door; and the width was fifty cubits. 
EZK.42.3	Opposite the twenty 
EZK.42.4	In front of the [attached] chambers was an inner walkway ten cubits wide 
EZK.42.5	Now the upper chambers were smaller because the galleries took away more 
EZK.42.6	for they were in three stories and did not have pillars like the pillars of the [outer] courtyards; therefore 
EZK.42.7	And the outer wall, by the side of the chambers, toward the outer courtyard facing the chambers, was fifty cubits long. 
EZK.42.8	For the length of the chambers which were in the outer courtyard was fifty cubits, 
EZK.42.9	Below these chambers was the entrance on the east side, as one enters them from the outer courtyard.
EZK.42.10	In the width of the wall of the courtyard toward the east, facing the separate area and facing the building, were chambers; 
EZK.42.11	and a passage in front of them was like the appearance of the [attached] chambers on the north, 
EZK.42.12	And like the entrances of the chambers that were toward the south there was an entrance at the head of the walkway, the walkway in front of the 
EZK.42.13	Then he (the angel) said to me, “The north chambers and the south chambers, which are opposite the separate area, are the holy chambers where the priests who are close to the L
EZK.42.14	When the priests enter [the Holy Place], they shall not go out from the sanctuary into the outer court 
EZK.42.15	Now when he had finished measuring the inner temple, he brought me out toward the gate which faced east and measured the outer area all around. 
EZK.42.16	He measured the east side with the measuring 
EZK.42.17	He measured the north side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod. 
EZK.42.18	He measured the south side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod. 
EZK.42.19	He turned about to the west side and measured five hundred rods by the measuring rod. 
EZK.42.20	He measured it on the four sides; it had a wall all around, the length five hundred and the width five hundred, to make a separation between that which was holy [the temple proper] and that which was common [the outer area].
EZK.43.1	Then he (the angel) led me to the gate, the gate that faces toward the east. 
EZK.43.2	And behold, the glory 
EZK.43.3	And it was like the appearance of the vision which I saw, like the vision I saw when He came to destroy the city. And the visions were like the vision I saw beside the River Chebar [near Babylon]; and I fell face downward. 
EZK.43.4	And the glory 
EZK.43.5	Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner courtyard; and behold, the glory 
EZK.43.6	And I heard One speaking to me from the temple, while a man was standing beside me. 
EZK.43.7	And He [the L

EZK.43.9	Now let them put far away from Me their [idolatrous] prostitution and the corpses 
EZK.43.10	“As for you, son of man, 
EZK.43.11	If they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the temple (house), its layout, its exits, its entrances, all its designs, all its statutes, and all its laws. And write it down in their sight, so that they may keep its whole design and all its statutes and do them. 
EZK.43.12	This is the law of the temple: Its entire 
EZK.43.13	“And these are the measurements of the altar [of burnt offering] in cubits (the cubit being a [long] cubit [the length of a forearm] and a hand width): the

EZK.43.20	And you shall take some of its blood and put it on the four horns [of the altar of burnt offering] and on the four corners of the ledge and on the border all around; thus you shall cleanse it (from sin) and make atonement for it. 
EZK.43.21	You shall also take the bull for the sin offering, and it shall be burned in the appointed place of the temple, outside the sanctuary.
EZK.43.22	‘On the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish for a sin offering, and they shall cleanse the altar as they cleansed it with the bull. 
EZK.43.23	When you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a young bull without blemish and a ram from the flock without blemish. 
EZK.43.24	You shall present them before the L
EZK.43.25	For seven days you shall prepare daily a goat for a sin offering; also a young bull and a ram from the flock, without blemish, shall be prepared. 
EZK.43.26	For seven days they shall make atonement for the altar and purify it; so the priests shall consecrate it [to receive offerings]. 
EZK.43.27	When they have completed these days, on the eighth day and from then onward, the priests shall offer your burnt offerings on the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you,’ says the Lord G

EZK.44.11	Yet they shall minister in My sanctuary, having oversight [as guards] at the gates of the temple and ministering in the temple. They shall slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them. 
EZK.44.12	Because the priests ministered to them before their idols and became a stumbling block of sin to the house of Israel, therefore I have lifted up My hand 
EZK.44.13	And they shall not come near to Me to serve as priests to Me, nor come near to any of My holy things, to the things that are most holy; but they shall bear their shame 
EZK.44.14	Yet I will appoint them as caretakers of the temple, for all its service and for all that shall be done in it.
EZK.44.15	“But the Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who performed the duty of My sanctuary when the children (descendants) of Israel went astray from Me, shall come near to Me to minister to Me; and they shall stand before Me to offer to Me the fat and the blood,” declares the Lord G
EZK.44.16	“They shall enter into My sanctuary; and they shall come near to My table to minister to Me and they shall perform [the priestly] duty to me. 
EZK.44.17	It shall be that when they enter the gates of the inner courtyard, they shall be clothed in linen garments; no wool shall be on them while they minister at the gates of the inner courtyard and within the temple (house). 
EZK.44.18	They shall have linen turbans on their heads and linen undergarments on their

EZK.44.28	“It [their ministry to Me] shall be as an inheritance to them, for I am their inheritance; and you shall give them no property (land) in Israel, for I am their possession.

EZK.45.21	“In the first

EZK.45.23	And for the seven days of the feast he shall provide as a burnt offering to the L

EZK.46.6	On the day of the New Moon 
EZK.46.7	And he shall provide a grain offering, an ephah with the bull and an ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he is able, and a hin of oil with an ephah. 
EZK.46.8	When the prince enters, he shall enter by way of the porch of the gate and go out by the same way. 
EZK.46.9	But when the people of the land come before the L
EZK.46.10	When they go in, the prince shall go in among them; and when they go out, he shall go out.

EZK.46.15	Thus they shall provide the lamb, the grain offering and the oil every morning as a continual burnt offering.”
EZK.46.16	‘Thus says the Lord G
EZK.46.17	But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his until the year of liberty [the Year of Jubilee]; after that it shall be returned to the prince. His inheritance 
EZK.46.18	Moreover, the prince shall not take from the people’s inheritance by oppression 
EZK.46.19	Then he [my guide] brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which faced the north; and behold, a place was there at their extreme westward end. 
EZK.46.20	He said to me, “This is the place where the priests shall boil (cook) the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the grain offering, so that they do not bring them out into the outer courtyard to transmit holiness to the people.”
EZK.46.21	Then he brought me out into the outer courtyard and led me across to the four corners of the courtyard; and behold, in every corner of the courtyard 
EZK.46.22	In the four corners of the courtyard 
EZK.46.23	 a row

EZK.47.5	Again he measured a thousand [cubits]; 
EZK.47.6	And he said to me, “Son of man, have you seen this?” Then he brought me back to the bank of the river. 
EZK.47.7	Now when I had returned, behold, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other. 
EZK.47.8	Then he said to me, “These waters go out toward the eastern region and go down into the Arabah (the Jordan Valley); then they go toward the sea, being made to flow into the sea, and the waters

EZK.47.10	And it will come about that fishermen will stand beside it [at the banks of the Dead Sea]; from Engedi to Eneglaim there will be dry places to spread nets. Their fish will be of very many kinds, like the fish of the Great [Mediterranean] Sea. 
EZK.47.11	But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh [and wholesome for animal life]; they will [as the river subsides] be left encrusted with salt.

EZK.47.14	You shall divide it as an inheritance, each one equally with the other. I lifted up My hand

EZK.47.17	So the boundary will extend from the [Mediterranean] Sea to Hazar-enan at the border of Damascus, and on the north, northward, is the border of Hamath. This is the north side.

DAN.1.1	In the third year of the reign of 
DAN.1.2	The Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, along with some of the articles of the house of God; and he brought them into the land of 
DAN.1.3	And the [Babylonian] king told Ashpenaz, the chief of his 
DAN.1.4	young men without blemish and handsome in appearance, skillful in all wisdom, endowed with intelligence 
DAN.1.5	The king assigned a daily ration for them from his finest food and from the wine which he drank. They were to be educated 
DAN.1.6	Among them from the sons of Judah were: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. 
DAN.1.7	The commander of the officials gave them [Babylonian] names: Daniel he named Belteshazzar, Hananiah 
DAN.1.8	But Daniel made up his mind that he would not defile (taint, dishonor) himself with the 
DAN.1.9	Now God granted Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the commander of the officials, 
DAN.1.10	and the commander of the officials said to Daniel, “I am afraid of my lord the king, who has prearranged your food and your drink; for why should he see your faces looking more haggard than the young men who are your own age? Then you would make me forfeit my head to the king.” 
DAN.1.11	But Daniel said to the overseer whom the commander of the officials had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, 
DAN.1.12	“Please, test your servants for ten days, and let us be given some vegetables to eat and water to drink. 
DAN.1.13	Then let our appearance and the appearance of the young men who eat the king’s finest food be observed 
DAN.1.14	So the man listened to them in this matter and tested them for ten days. 
DAN.1.15	At the end of ten days it seemed that they were looking better and 
DAN.1.16	So the overseer continued to withhold their fine food and the wine they were to drink, and kept giving them vegetables.
DAN.1.17	As for these four young men, God gave them knowledge and skill in all 
DAN.1.18	At the end of the time set by the king to bring all the young men in [before him], the commander of the officials presented them to Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.1.19	The king spoke with them, and among them all not one was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; so they were [selected and] assigned to stand before the king 
DAN.1.20	In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king consulted them, he found them ten times better than all the [learned] magicians and enchanters (Magi) in his whole realm. 
DAN.1.21	And Daniel remained there until the 
DAN.2.1	In the second year (604 
DAN.2.2	Then the king gave a command to call the magicians, the enchanters, the sorcerers, and the 
DAN.2.3	The king said to them, “I had a dream, and my spirit is troubled 
DAN.2.4	Then the Chaldeans said to the king in 
DAN.2.5	The king replied to the Chaldeans, “My command is firm 
DAN.2.6	But if you tell [me] the [content of the] dream along with its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. So tell me the dream and its interpretation.” 
DAN.2.7	They answered again, “Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will explain its interpretation [to you].” 
DAN.2.8	The king replied, “I know for certain that you are bargaining for time, because you have seen that my command [to you] is firm 
DAN.2.9	If you will not reveal to me the [content of the] dream, there is but one sentence for you; for you have [already] prepared lying and corrupt words [and you have agreed together] to speak [them] before me [hoping to delay your execution] until the situation is changed. Therefore, tell me the dream [first], and then I will know [with confidence] that you can give me its interpretation.” 
DAN.2.10	The Chaldeans answered the king and said, “There is not a man on earth who can tell the king this matter, for no king, lord or ruler has ever asked such a thing as this of any magician or enchanter or Chaldean. 
DAN.2.11	Furthermore, what the king demands is an unusual 
DAN.2.12	Because of this the king was indignant and extremely furious and gave a command to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. 
DAN.2.13	So the decree went out that the wise men were to be killed; and they looked for Daniel and his companions to put them to death.
DAN.2.14	Then Daniel replied with discretion and wisdom to Arioch, the captain of the king’s 
DAN.2.15	he said to Arioch, the king’s captain, “Why is the decree from the king so harsh 
DAN.2.16	So Daniel went in and asked the king to appoint a date 
DAN.2.17	Then Daniel returned to his house and discussed the matter with Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions, 
DAN.2.18	in order that they might seek compassion from the God of heaven regarding this secret, so that Daniel and his companions would not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
DAN.2.19	Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night, and Daniel blessed the God of heaven. 
DAN.2.20	Daniel answered,
DAN.2.20	“Blessed be the name of God forever and ever,
DAN.2.20	For wisdom and power belong to Him.
DAN.2.21	It is He who changes the times and the seasons;
DAN.2.21	He removes kings and establishes kings.
DAN.2.21	He gives wisdom to the wise
DAN.2.21	And [greater] knowledge to those who have understanding!
DAN.2.22	It is He who reveals the profound and hidden things;
DAN.2.22	He knows what is in the darkness,
DAN.2.22	And the light dwells with Him.
DAN.2.23	I thank You and praise You, O God of my fathers,
DAN.2.23	For You have given me wisdom and power;
DAN.2.23	Even now You have made known to me what we requested of You,
DAN.2.23	For You have made known to us [the solution to] the king’s matter.”
DAN.2.24	So Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said this to him: “Do not execute the wise men of Babylon! Bring me before the king, and I will reveal to the king the interpretation [of his dream].”
DAN.2.25	Then Arioch hurriedly brought Daniel before the king and said this to him: “I have found a man among the exiles of Judah who can explain to the king the interpretation [of the dream].” 
DAN.2.26	The king said to Daniel, whose [Babylonian] name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to reveal to me the [content of the] dream which I have seen and its interpretation?” 
DAN.2.27	Daniel answered the king and said, “Regarding the mystery about which the king has inquired, neither the wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor astrologers are able to answer the king, 
DAN.2.28	but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will take place in the latter days (end of days). This was your dream and the vision [that appeared] in your mind while on your bed. 
DAN.2.29	As for you, O king, as you were lying on your bed thoughts came into your mind about what will take place in the future; and He who reveals secrets has shown you what will occur. 
DAN.2.30	But as for me, this secret has not been revealed to me because my wisdom is greater than that of any other living man, but in order to make the interpretation known to the king, and so that you may understand [fully] the thoughts of your mind.
DAN.2.31	“You, O king, were looking, and behold, [there was] a single great statue; this image, which was large and of unsurpassed splendor, stood before you, and its appearance was awesome 
DAN.2.32	As for this 
DAN.2.33	its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay [pottery]. 
DAN.2.34	As you were looking, a 
DAN.2.35	Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed together and became like the chaff from the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away so that not a trace of them could be found. And the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.
DAN.2.36	“This was the dream; now we will tell the king its interpretation. 
DAN.2.37	You, O king, are the king of [earthly] kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, the strength and the glory; 
DAN.2.38	and wherever the sons of men dwell, and the beasts of the field, and the birds of the heavens, He has given them into your hand and has made you ruler over them all. You [king of Babylon] are the head of gold.
DAN.2.39	After you will arise another kingdom (Medo-Persia) inferior to you, and then a third kingdom of bronze (Greece under Alexander the Great), which will rule over all the earth.
DAN.2.40	Then a fourth kingdom (Rome) will be strong as iron, for iron breaks to pieces and shatters all things; and like iron which crushes things in pieces, it will break and crush all these [others]. 
DAN.2.41	And as you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron, it will be a divided kingdom; but there will be in it some of the durability 
DAN.2.42	As the [ten] toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, so some of the kingdom will be strong, and 
DAN.2.43	And as you saw the iron mixed with common clay, so they will combine with one another in the seed of men; but they will not merge [for such diverse things or ideologies cannot unite], even as iron does not mix with clay.
DAN.2.44	In the days of those [final ten] kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will its sovereignty be left for another people; but it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it will stand forever. 
DAN.2.45	Just as you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it crushed the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold, the great God has revealed to the king what will take place in the future; so the dream is true and its interpretation is trustworthy.”
DAN.2.46	Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell face downward and paid respect to Daniel [as a great prophet of the highest God], and gave orders for an offering and fragrant incense to be presented to him [in honor of his God]. 
DAN.2.47	The king answered Daniel and said, “Most certainly your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, since you have been able to reveal this mystery!” 
DAN.2.48	Then the king promoted Daniel [to an exalted position] and gave him many great gifts, and he made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon. 
DAN.2.49	And Daniel made a request of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego over the affairs of the province of Babylon, while Daniel was at the court of the king.
DAN.3.1	Nebuchadnezzar the king made a 
DAN.3.2	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent 
DAN.3.3	Then the satraps, the prefects, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates 
DAN.3.4	Then the herald loudly proclaimed, “You are commanded, O peoples, nations, and 
DAN.3.5	that at the moment you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon (four-stringed harp), dulcimer, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. 
DAN.3.6	Whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be thrown into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire.” 
DAN.3.7	So when the people heard the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, dulcimer, bagpipe and all kinds of music, all the peoples, nations, and 
DAN.3.8	At that time certain Chaldeans came forward and brought [malicious] accusations against the Jews. 
DAN.3.9	They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “O king, live forever! 
DAN.3.10	You, O king, have made a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, dulcimer, bagpipe, and all kinds of music is to fall down and worship the golden image. 
DAN.3.11	Whoever does not fall down and worship shall be thrown into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire. 
DAN.3.12	There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon, 
DAN.3.13	Then Nebuchadnezzar in a furious rage gave a command to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; and these men were brought before the king. 
DAN.3.14	Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image which I have set up? 
DAN.3.15	Now if you are ready, when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, to fall down and worship the image which I have made, very good. But if you do not worship, you shall be thrown at once into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire; and what god is there who can rescue you out of my hands?”
DAN.3.16	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to answer you on this point. 
DAN.3.17	If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to rescue us from the furnace of blazing fire, and He will rescue us from your hand, O king. 
DAN.3.18	But even if 
DAN.3.19	Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with fury, and his facial expression changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then he gave a command that the furnace was to be heated seven 
DAN.3.20	He commanded certain strong men in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego and to throw them into the furnace of blazing fire. 
DAN.3.21	Then these [three] men were tied up in their trousers, their coats, their turbans, and their other clothes, and were thrown into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire. 
DAN.3.22	Because the king’s command was urgent and the furnace was extremely hot, the flame of the fire killed the men who carried up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. 
DAN.3.23	But these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire 
DAN.3.24	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king [looked and] was astounded, and he jumped up and said to his counselors, “Did we not throw three men who were tied up into the midst of the fire?” They replied to the king, “Certainly, O king.” 
DAN.3.25	He answered, “Look! I see four men untied, walking around in the midst of the fire, and they are not hurt! And the appearance of the fourth is like 
DAN.3.26	Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the door of the blazing furnace and said, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, servants of the Most High God, come out [of there]! Come here!” Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came out of the midst of the fire. 
DAN.3.27	The satraps, the prefects, the governors and the king’s counselors gathered around them and saw that in regard to these men the fire had no effect on their bodies—their hair was not singed, their clothes were not scorched 
DAN.3.28	Nebuchadnezzar responded and said, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who has sent His angel and rescued His servants who believed in, trusted in, 
DAN.3.29	Therefore I make a decree that any people, nation, or language that speaks anything offensive against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego shall be cut into pieces and their houses be made a heap of rubbish, for there is no other god who is able to save in this way!” 
DAN.3.30	Then the king caused Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego to prosper in the province of Babylon.
DAN.4.1	Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all the peoples, nations, and 
DAN.4.2	It has seemed good to me to declare the signs and wonders which the Most High God has done for me.
DAN.4.3	How great are His signs
DAN.4.3	And how mighty are His wonders!
DAN.4.3	His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom
DAN.4.3	And His dominion is from generation to generation.
DAN.4.4	“I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house and prospering in my palace. 
DAN.4.5	I saw a dream and it made me afraid; and the fantasies 
DAN.4.6	So I gave orders to bring in before me all the wise men of Babylon, so that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream. 
DAN.4.7	Then the magicians, the enchanters (Magi), the Chaldeans [who were the master astrologers] and the diviners came in, and I told them the dream, but they could not interpret it 
DAN.4.8	But at last Daniel came in before me, whose name is Belteshazzar, after the name of my god, and in whom is 
DAN.4.9	‘O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, because I know that a spirit of the holy gods is in you and no mystery baffles 
DAN.4.10	‘The visions that passed through my mind as I lay on my bed were these: I was looking, and behold, 
DAN.4.11	The tree grew large and became strong
DAN.4.11	And its height reached to heaven,
DAN.4.11	And it was visible to the end of the earth.
DAN.4.12	Its leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant,
DAN.4.12	And in it was food for all.
DAN.4.12	The beasts of the field found shade under it,
DAN.4.12	And the birds of the sky nested in its branches,
DAN.4.12	And all living creatures fed themselves from it.
DAN.4.13	‘And behold, I saw in the visions of my mind 
DAN.4.14	He shouted aloud and said this:
DAN.4.14	“Cut down the tree and cut off its branches;
DAN.4.14	Shake off its leaves and scatter its fruit;
DAN.4.14	Let the living creatures run from under it
DAN.4.14	And the birds fly from its branches.
DAN.4.15	Nevertheless leave the stump with its roots in the ground,
DAN.4.15	Bound with a band of iron and bronze
DAN.4.15	In the new grass of the field;
DAN.4.15	And let him be wet with the dew of heaven,
DAN.4.15	And let him feed with the animals in the grass of the earth.
DAN.4.16	Let his mind 
DAN.4.16	And let an animal’s mind 
DAN.4.16	And let seven periods of time pass over him.
DAN.4.17	This sentence is by the decree of the 
DAN.4.17	And the decision is a command of the holy ones,
DAN.4.17	So that the living may know [without any doubt]
DAN.4.17	That the Most High [God] rules over the kingdom of mankind
DAN.4.17	And He bestows it on whomever He desires
DAN.4.17	And sets over it the humblest 
DAN.4.18	This is the dream which I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen. Now you, Belteshazzar, explain its meaning, since none of the wise men of my kingdom are able to reveal its interpretation to me; but you are able, for a spirit of the holy gods is in you.’
DAN.4.19	“Then Daniel, whose [Babylonian] name was Belteshazzar, was appalled 
DAN.4.20	The tree that you saw, which became great and grew strong, whose height reached to heaven and which was visible to all the earth, 
DAN.4.21	whose foliage was beautiful and its fruit abundant, and on which was food for all, under which the beasts of the field lived, and in whose branches the birds of the sky nested— 
DAN.4.22	it is you, O king, who have become great and grown strong; your greatness has increased and it reaches to heaven, and your dominion [reaches] to the ends of the earth. 
DAN.4.23	In that the king saw an 
DAN.4.24	this is the interpretation, O king: It is the decree of the Most High [God], which has come upon my lord the king: 
DAN.4.25	that you shall be driven from mankind and your dwelling place shall be with the beasts of the field; and that you be given grass to eat like the cattle and be wet with the dew of heaven; and seven periods of time shall pass over you, until you know [without any doubt] that the Most High [God] rules over the kingdom of mankind and He bestows it to whomever He desires. 
DAN.4.26	And in that it was commanded to leave the stump with the roots of the tree [in the earth], your kingdom shall be restored to you after you recognize (understand fully) that Heaven rules. 
DAN.4.27	Therefore, O king, let my advice to you be [considered and found] acceptable; break away now from your sins 
DAN.4.28	“All this happened to Nebuchadnezzar the king. 
DAN.4.29	Twelve months later he was walking on the upper level of the royal palace of Babylon. 
DAN.4.30	The king said thoughtfully, ‘Is not this the great Babylon which I myself have built as the royal residence 
DAN.4.31	While the words were still in the king’s mouth, a voice came [as if falling] from heaven, 
DAN.4.32	and you will be driven away from mankind, and your dwelling place will be with the animals of the field. You will be given grass to eat like the cattle, and seven periods of time will pass over you until you know [without any doubt] that the Most High God rules over the kingdom of mankind and He bestows it on whomever He desires.” ’ 
DAN.4.33	Immediately the word concerning Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was 
DAN.4.34	“But at the end of the days [that is, at the seven periods of time], I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven, and my understanding 
DAN.4.34	For His dominion is an everlasting dominion;
DAN.4.34	And His kingdom 
DAN.4.35	All the inhabitants of the earth are regarded as nothing.
DAN.4.35	But He does according to His will in the host of heaven
DAN.4.35	And among the inhabitants of the earth;
DAN.4.35	And no one can hold back His hand
DAN.4.35	Or say to Him, ‘What have You done?’
DAN.4.36	Now at the same time my reason returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and splendor were returned to me, and my counselors and my nobles began seeking me out; so I was re-established in my kingdom, and still more greatness [than before] was added to me. 
DAN.4.37	Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and honor the King of heaven, for all His works are true 
DAN.5.1	Belshazzar the king [who was a descendant of Nebuchadnezzar] gave a great feast for a thousand of his nobles, and he was drinking his wine in the presence of the thousand [guests]. 
DAN.5.2	Belshazzar, as he tasted the wine, gave a command to bring in the gold and silver vessels which his 
DAN.5.3	Then they brought in the gold 
DAN.5.4	They drank the wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood and stone.
DAN.5.5	Suddenly the fingers of a man’s hand appeared and began writing opposite the lampstand on [a well-lit area of] the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace, and the king saw the part of the hand that did the writing. 
DAN.5.6	Then the king’s face grew pale, and his thoughts alarmed him; the joints 
DAN.5.7	The king called aloud to bring in the enchanters (Magi), the Chaldeans [who were master astrologers] and the diviners. The king said to the wise men of Babylon, “Whoever can read this writing and explain its interpretation to me shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold put around his neck, and have authority as the 
DAN.5.8	Then all the king’s wise men came in, but they could not 
DAN.5.9	Then King Belshazzar was greatly perplexed, his face became even paler, and his nobles were bewildered 
DAN.5.10	Now the queen [mother], overhearing the [excited] words of the king and his nobles, came into the banquet area. The queen [mother] spoke and said, “O king, live forever! Do not be alarmed at your thoughts or let your face be changed. 
DAN.5.11	There is a man in your kingdom in whom is 
DAN.5.12	It was because an extraordinary spirit, knowledge and insight, the ability to interpret dreams, clarify riddles, and solve complex problems were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called and he will give the interpretation.”
DAN.5.13	Then Daniel was brought in before the king. And the king said to Daniel, “Are you that Daniel who is one of the sons of the exiles of Judah, whom my father the king brought from Judah? 
DAN.5.14	I have heard of you, that a spirit of the gods is in you, and that illumination, insight, and extraordinary wisdom have been found in you. 
DAN.5.15	Now the wise men and the enchanters, were brought in before me so that they might read this writing and reveal its meaning to me, but they could not give the interpretation of the message. 
DAN.5.16	But I personally have heard about you, that you are able to make interpretations and solve complex problems. Now if you are able to read the writing and reveal its interpretation to me, you shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold put around your neck, and you shall have authority as the third 
DAN.5.17	Then Daniel answered and said before the king, “Keep your gifts for yourself and give your rewards to someone else; however, I will read the writing to the king and reveal the interpretation to him. 
DAN.5.18	O king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father a kingdom and greatness and glory and majesty; 
DAN.5.19	and because of the greatness that He gave him, all the peoples, nations, and 
DAN.5.20	But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit became so proud that he behaved arrogantly, he was deposed from his royal throne and his glory was taken away from him. 
DAN.5.21	He was also driven from mankind, and his mind was made like that of an animal, and his dwelling place was with the wild donkeys. He was given grass to eat like cattle, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven until he came to know [without any doubt] that the Most High God rules over the kingdom of mankind and He appoints it to whomever He wills. 
DAN.5.22	And you, his 
DAN.5.23	And you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven, and the vessels of His house have been brought before you, and you and your nobles, your wives and your concubines have been drinking wine from them; and you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which do not see or hear or understand. But the God who holds in His hand your breath of life and your ways you have not honored 
DAN.5.24	Then the hand was sent from the presence [of the Most High God], and this inscription was written:
DAN.5.25	“This is the 
DAN.5.26	This is the interpretation of the message: ‘
DAN.5.27	‘
DAN.5.28	‘
DAN.5.29	Then Belshazzar gave the command, and Daniel was clothed with purple and a chain of gold was put around his neck, and a proclamation concerning him was issued [declaring] that he now had authority as the third 
DAN.5.30	During that same 
DAN.5.31	So 
DAN.6.1	It seemed good to Darius [who became king after Belshazzar] to appoint over the kingdom 120 
DAN.6.2	and over them three chief commissioners (of whom Daniel was one), that these satraps might be accountable to them, so that the king would have no loss [from disloyalty or mismanagement]. 
DAN.6.3	Then this Daniel, because of the extraordinary spirit within him, began distinguishing himself among the commissioners and the satraps, and the king planned to appoint him over the entire realm. 
DAN.6.4	Then the [other two] commissioners and the satraps began trying to find a reason to bring a complaint against Daniel concerning the [administration of the] kingdom; but they could find no reason for an accusation or 
DAN.6.5	Then these men said, “We will not find any basis for an accusation against this Daniel unless we find something against him in connection with the law of his God.”
DAN.6.6	Then these commissioners and satraps agreed to approach the king and said to him, “King Darius, live forever! 
DAN.6.7	All the commissioners of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the counselors and the governors have consulted 
DAN.6.8	Now, O king, establish the injunction and sign the document so that it may not be changed, in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which [insures that it] may not be altered 
DAN.6.9	So King Darius signed the document, that is, the injunction.
DAN.6.10	Now when Daniel knew that the document was signed, he went into his house (now in his roof chamber his windows were open toward Jerusalem); he continued to get down on his knees three times a day, praying and giving thanks before his God, as he had been doing previously. 
DAN.6.11	Then, by agreement, these men came [together] and found Daniel praying and making requests before his God. 
DAN.6.12	Then they approached and spoke before the king regarding his injunction, “Have you not signed an injunction that anyone who petitions (prays to) any god or man except you, O king, within the 
DAN.6.13	Then they answered and said before the king, “Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, does not pay any attention to you, O king, or to the injunction which you have signed, but keeps praying [to his God] three times a day.”
DAN.6.14	Then, as soon as the king heard these words, he was deeply distressed [over what he had done] and set his mind on rescuing Daniel; and he struggled until the sun went down [trying to work out a way] to save him. 
DAN.6.15	Then, by agreement, these same men came to the king and said, “Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no injunction or statute which the king establishes may be altered 
DAN.6.16	Then the king gave a command, and Daniel was brought and thrown into the den of lions. The king said to Daniel, “May your God, whom you constantly serve, rescue you Himself!” 
DAN.6.17	A stone was brought and laid over the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signet rings of his nobles, so that nothing would be changed concerning Daniel. 
DAN.6.18	Then the king returned to his palace and spent the night fasting; and no music or entertainment was brought before him, and he remained unable to sleep.
DAN.6.19	Then the king arose at dawn, at the break of day, and hurried to the den of lions. 
DAN.6.20	When he had come near the den, he called out to Daniel with a troubled voice. The king said to Daniel, “O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you constantly serve, been able to rescue you from the lions?” 
DAN.6.21	Then Daniel spoke to the king, “O king, live forever! 
DAN.6.22	My God has sent His angel and has shut the mouths of the lions so that they have not hurt me, because I was found innocent before Him; and also before you, O king, I have committed no crime.” 
DAN.6.23	Then the king was greatly pleased and ordered that Daniel be taken out of the den. So Daniel was taken out of the den, and no injury whatever was found on him, because he believed in 
DAN.6.24	The king then gave a command, and those men who had maliciously accused Daniel were brought and thrown into the den of lions, they, their children and their wives; and before they reached the bottom of the den, the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.
DAN.6.25	Then Darius the king wrote to all the peoples, nations, and 
DAN.6.26	I issue a decree that in all the dominion of my kingdom men are to [reverently] fear and tremble before the God of Daniel,
DAN.6.26	For He is the living God, enduring 
DAN.6.26	And His kingdom is one which will not be destroyed,
DAN.6.26	And His dominion will be forever.
DAN.6.27	He rescues and saves and performs signs and wonders
DAN.6.27	In heaven and on earth—
DAN.6.27	He who has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions.”
DAN.6.28	So this [man] Daniel prospered 
DAN.7.1	In the 
DAN.7.2	Daniel said, “I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea (the nations). 
DAN.7.3	And four great beasts, each different from the other, were coming up out of the sea [in succession]. 
DAN.7.4	The first (the Babylonian Empire under Nebuchadnezzar) was like a lion and had the wings of an eagle. I kept looking until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man; a human mind was given to it. 
DAN.7.5	And behold, another beast, a second one (the Medo-Persian Empire), was like a bear, and it was raised up on one side (domain), and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, ‘Arise, devour much meat.’ 
DAN.7.6	After this I kept looking, and behold, another one (the Greek Empire of Alexander the Great), like a leopard, which had on its back four wings like those of a bird; the beast also had four heads (Alexander’s generals, his successors), and power to rule was given to it. 
DAN.7.7	After this I kept looking in the night visions, and behold, [I saw] a fourth beast (the Roman Empire), terrible and extremely strong; and it had huge iron teeth. It devoured and crushed and trampled down what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that came before it, and it had ten horns (ten kings). 
DAN.7.8	While I was considering the horns, behold, there came up among them 
DAN.7.9	“I kept looking
DAN.7.9	Until thrones were set up,
DAN.7.9	And the Ancient of Days (God) took His seat;
DAN.7.9	His garment was white as snow
DAN.7.9	And the hair of His head like pure wool.
DAN.7.9	His throne was flames of fire;
DAN.7.9	Its wheels were a burning fire.
DAN.7.10	A river of fire was flowing
DAN.7.10	And coming out from before Him;
DAN.7.10	A thousand thousands were attending Him,
DAN.7.10	And ten thousand times ten thousand were standing before Him;
DAN.7.10	The court was seated,
DAN.7.10	And the books were opened.
DAN.7.11	Then I kept looking because of the sound of the great 
DAN.7.12	As for the rest of the beasts, their power was taken away; yet their lives were prolonged [for the length of their lives was fixed] for a predetermined time.
DAN.7.13	“I kept looking in the night visions,
DAN.7.13	And behold, 
DAN.7.13	One like a Son of Man was coming,
DAN.7.13	And He came up to the Ancient of Days
DAN.7.13	And was presented before Him.
DAN.7.14	And to Him (the Messiah) was given dominion (supreme authority),
DAN.7.14	Glory and a kingdom,
DAN.7.14	That all the peoples, nations, and 
DAN.7.14	Should serve 
DAN.7.14	His dominion is an everlasting dominion
DAN.7.14	Which will not pass away;
DAN.7.14	And His kingdom is one
DAN.7.14	Which will not be destroyed.
DAN.7.15	“As for me, Daniel, my spirit was distressed 
DAN.7.16	I approached one of those who stood by and began asking him the exact meaning of all this. So he told me and explained to me the interpretation of the things: 
DAN.7.17	‘These four great beasts are four kings who will arise from the earth. 
DAN.7.18	But the 
DAN.7.19	“Then I wished to know the exact meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, extremely dreadful, with teeth of iron and claws of bronze, which devoured, crushed and trampled down what was left with its feet, 
DAN.7.20	and 
DAN.7.21	As I kept looking, that horn was making war with the saints (believers) and overpowering them 
DAN.7.22	until the Ancient of Days came and judgment was passed in favor of the saints of the Most High [God], and the time arrived when the saints (believers) took possession of the kingdom.
DAN.7.23	“Thus the angel said, ‘The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom on earth, which will be different from all other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth and tread it down, and crush it. 
DAN.7.24	As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will arise; and another will arise after them, and he will be different from the former ones, and he will subdue three kings. 
DAN.7.25	He will speak words against the Most High [God] and wear down the saints of the Most High, and he will intend to change the times and the law; and they will be given into his hand for a time, [two] times, and half a time [three and one-half years]. 
DAN.7.26	But the court [of the Most High] will sit 
DAN.7.27	Then the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of all the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the people of the saints (believers) of the Most High; His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all the dominions will serve and obey Him.’
DAN.7.28	“This is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my [waking] thoughts were extremely troubling and alarming and my face grew pale; but I kept the matter [of the vision and the angel’s explanation] to myself.”
DAN.8.1	In the 
DAN.8.2	I looked in the vision and it seemed that I was at the citadel of 
DAN.8.3	Then I raised my eyes and looked, and behold, there in front of the canal stood a [lone] ram (the Medo-Persian Empire) which had two horns. The two horns were high, but one (Persia) was higher than the other (Media), and the higher one came up last. 
DAN.8.4	I saw the ram (Medo-Persia) charging westward and northward and southward; no beast could stand before him, nor was there anyone who could rescue [anything] from his power, but he did as he pleased and magnified 
DAN.8.5	As I was observing [this], behold, a male goat (Greece) was coming from the west [rushing] across the face of the whole earth without touching the ground; and the goat had a conspicuous 
DAN.8.6	He came up to the ram that had the two horns, which I had seen standing in front of the canal, and charged at him in [the fury of] his power 
DAN.8.7	[In my vision] I saw him come close to the ram (Medo-Persia), and he was filled with rage toward him; and the goat (Greece) struck the ram and shattered his two horns, and the ram had no strength to stand before him. So the goat threw him to the ground and trampled on him, and there was no one who could rescue the ram from his power. 
DAN.8.8	Then the male goat magnified himself exceedingly, and when he was [young and] strong, the great horn (Alexander) was [suddenly] 
DAN.8.9	Out of one of them (Antiochus IV Epiphanes) came forth a rather small horn [but one of irreverent presumption and profane pride] which grew exceedingly powerful toward the south, toward the east, and toward the Beautiful 
DAN.8.10	And [in my vision] this 
DAN.8.11	Indeed, it magnified itself to be equal with the 
DAN.8.12	Because of the transgression [of God’s people—their irreverence and ungodliness] the host will be given over 
DAN.8.13	Then I heard a holy one (angel) speaking, and another holy one said to the one who was speaking, “How much time will be required to complete the vision regarding the regular sacrifice, the transgression that brings horror, and the trampling underfoot of both the sanctuary and the host [of the people]?” 
DAN.8.14	He said to me, “For 2,300 evenings and mornings; 
DAN.8.15	When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it; then behold, standing before me was one who looked like a man. 
DAN.8.16	And I heard the voice of a man between 
DAN.8.17	So he came near where I was standing, and when he came I was frightened and fell face downward; but he said to me, “Understand, son of man, that the [fulfillment of the] vision pertains to [events that will occur in] the time of the end.”
DAN.8.18	Now as he (Gabriel) was speaking with me, I drifted into a deep sleep (unconsciousness) with my face to the ground; but he touched me and made me stand [where I had stood before]. 
DAN.8.19	He said, “Behold, I am going to let you know what will happen during the final time of the indignation 
DAN.8.20	The ram which you saw with the two horns represents the kings of Media and Persia.
DAN.8.21	The shaggy (rough-coated) male goat 
DAN.8.22	 the shattered 
DAN.8.23	At the latter period of their reign,
DAN.8.23	When the transgressors have finished,
DAN.8.23	A 
DAN.8.23	Insolent and skilled in intrigue 
DAN.8.24	His power will be mighty, but not by his own power;
DAN.8.24	And he will corrupt 
DAN.8.24	And [he will] prosper and do exactly as he wills;
DAN.8.24	He shall corrupt 
DAN.8.25	And through his shrewdness
DAN.8.25	He will cause deceit to succeed by his hand (influence);
DAN.8.25	He will magnify himself in his mind,
DAN.8.25	He will corrupt 
DAN.8.25	He will also stand up 
DAN.8.25	But he will be broken, and that by no human hand [but by the hand of God].
DAN.8.26	The vision of the evenings and the mornings
DAN.8.26	Which has been told [to you] is true.
DAN.8.26	But keep the vision a secret,
DAN.8.26	For it has to do with many days 
DAN.8.27	And I, Daniel, was exhausted and was sick for [several] days. Afterward I got up and continued with the king’s business; but I was astounded at the vision, and there was no one who could explain it.
DAN.9.1	In the first year of Darius the son of 
DAN.9.2	in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood from the books the number of years which, according to the word of the L
DAN.9.3	So I directed my attention to the Lord God to seek Him by prayer and supplications, with fasting, sackcloth and ashes. 
DAN.9.4	I prayed to the L
DAN.9.5	we have sinned and committed wrong, and have behaved wickedly and have rebelled, turning away from Your commandments and ordinances. 
DAN.9.6	Further, we have not listened to 
DAN.9.7	“Righteousness belongs to You, O Lord, but to us confusion 
DAN.9.8	O L
DAN.9.9	To the Lord our God 
DAN.9.10	and we have not obeyed the voice of the L
DAN.9.11	Yes, all Israel has transgressed Your law, even turning aside, not obeying Your voice; so the curse has been poured out on us and the oath which is written in the Law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against Him. 
DAN.9.12	And He has carried out completely His [threatening] words which He had spoken against us and against our rulers [the kings, princes, and judges] who ruled us, to bring on us a great tragedy; for under the whole heaven there has not been done anything [so dreadful] like that which [He commanded and] was done to Jerusalem. 
DAN.9.13	Just as it is written in the Law of Moses, all this tragedy has come on us. Yet we have not wholeheartedly begged for forgiveness 
DAN.9.14	Therefore the L
DAN.9.15	“And now, O Lord our God, who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and who made for Yourself a name, as it is today—we have sinned, we have been wicked. 
DAN.9.16	O Lord, in accordance with all Your righteous 
DAN.9.17	Now therefore, our God, listen to (heed) the prayer of Your servant 
DAN.9.18	O my God, incline Your ear and hear; open Your eyes and look at our desolations and the city which is called by Your name; for we are not presenting our supplications before You because of our own merits 
DAN.9.19	O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, listen and take action! Do not delay, for Your own sake, O my God, because Your city and Your people are called by Your name.”
DAN.9.20	While I was still speaking and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the L
DAN.9.21	while I was still speaking in prayer and 
DAN.9.22	He instructed me and he talked with me and said, “O Daniel, I have now come to give you insight 
DAN.9.23	At the beginning of your supplications, the command [to give you an answer] was issued, and I have come to tell you, for you are highly regarded 
DAN.9.24	“Seventy weeks [of years, or 490 years] 
DAN.9.25	So you are to know and understand that from the issuance of the command to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until [the coming of] the Messiah (the Anointed One), the Prince, 
DAN.9.26	Then after the sixty-two weeks [of years] the Anointed One will be cut off [and denied His Messianic kingdom] and have nothing [and no one to defend Him], and the people of the [other] prince who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end 
DAN.9.27	And he will enter into a binding 
DAN.10.1	In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a message was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshazzar; and the message was true and it referred to great conflict (warfare, misery). And he understood the message and had an understanding of the vision.
DAN.10.2	In those days I, Daniel, had been mourning for three entire weeks. 
DAN.10.3	I ate no tasty food, nor did any meat or wine enter my mouth; and I did not 
DAN.10.4	On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was on the bank of the great river Hiddekel [which is the Tigris], 
DAN.10.5	I raised my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a 
DAN.10.6	His body also was like beryl [with a golden luster], his face had the appearance of lightning, his eyes were like flaming torches, his arms and his feet like the gleam of burnished bronze, and the sound of his words was like the noise of a multitude [of people or the roaring of the sea]. 
DAN.10.7	And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision [of this heavenly being], for the men who were with me did not see the vision; nevertheless, a great panic overwhelmed them, so they ran away to hide themselves. 
DAN.10.8	So I was left alone and saw this great vision; yet no strength was left in me, for my normal appearance turned to a deathly pale, and I grew weak 
DAN.10.9	Then I heard the sound of his words; and when I heard the sound of his words, I fell on my face in a deep sleep, with my face toward the ground.
DAN.10.10	Then behold, a hand touched me and set me unsteadily on my 
DAN.10.11	So he said to me, “O Daniel, you highly regarded 
DAN.10.12	Then he said to me, “Do not be afraid, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart on understanding this and on humbling yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to your words. 
DAN.10.13	But the 
DAN.10.14	Now I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision is in regard to the days yet to come.”
DAN.10.15	When he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground and was speechless. 
DAN.10.16	And behold, one who resembled the sons of men touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke and said to him who was standing before me, “O my lord, because of the vision anguish has come upon me, and I have retained no strength. 
DAN.10.17	For how can such a [weakened] servant of my lord talk with such [a being] as my lord? For now there remains no strength in me, nor has any breath been left in me.”
DAN.10.18	Then the one (Gabriel) whose appearance was like that of a man touched me again, and he strengthened me. 
DAN.10.19	He said, “O man, highly regarded 
DAN.10.20	Then he said, “Do you understand [fully] why I came to you? Now I shall return to fight against the [hostile] 
DAN.10.21	But I (Gabriel) will tell you what is inscribed in the 
DAN.11.1	“Also I, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I (Gabriel) arose to be an encouragement and a protection for him. 
DAN.11.2	And now I will tell you the truth. Behold,

DAN.11.5	“Then the king of the South (Egypt) will be strong, along with one of his princes who will be stronger than he and have dominance over him; his domain will be a great dominion. 
DAN.11.6	After some years 
DAN.11.7	But out of a branch of her [familial] roots will one (her brother, Ptolemy III Euergetes I) arise in his place, and he will come against the [Syrian] army and enter the fortress of the king of the North, and he will deal with them and will prevail. 
DAN.11.8	Also he will carry off to Egypt their [Syrian] gods with their cast images and their precious

DAN.11.10	“His sons will prepare for battle and assemble a multitude of great forces; which will keep on coming and overflow [the land], and pass through, so that they may again wage war as far as his fortress. 
DAN.11.11	The king of the South (Ptolemy IV Philopator of Egypt) will be enraged and go out and fight with the king of the North (Antiochus III the Great); and 
DAN.11.12	When the multitude (army) is captured 
DAN.11.13	For the king of the North will again raise a multitude (army) greater than the one before, and after several years he will advance with a great army and substantial equipment.
DAN.11.14	“In those times many will rise up against the king of the South (Egypt); also the violent men among your own people will arise in order to fulfill the [earlier] visions, but they will fail. 
DAN.11.15	Then the king of the North (Syria) will come and build up siege ramps and capture a well-fortified city. The forces of the South will not stand 
DAN.11.16	But he (Syria) who comes against him (Egypt) will do exactly as he pleases, and no one will be able to stand against him; he (Antiochus III the Great) will also stay for a time in the Beautiful 
DAN.11.17	He will be determined to come with the power of his entire kingdom, and propose equitable conditions 
DAN.11.18	After this, he (Antiochus III the Great, King of Syria) will turn his attention to the

DAN.11.26	Yes, those who eat his fine food will betray 
DAN.11.27	And as for both of these 
DAN.11.28	Then he (Antiochus IV Epiphanes) will return to his land with great treasure (plunder); and his heart will be set against the holy covenant, and he will take action and return to his own land (Syria).
DAN.11.29	“At the time appointed [by God] he will return and come into the South, but this last time will not be successful as were the previous invasions [of Egypt]. 
DAN.11.30	For ships of Cyprus [in Roman hands] will come against him; therefore he will be discouraged and turn back [to Israel] and carry out his rage against the holy covenant and take action; so he will return and show favoritism toward those [Jews] who abandon (break) the holy covenant [with God]. 
DAN.11.31	Armed forces of his will arise [in Jerusalem] and defile

DAN.11.43	He will have power over the treasures of gold and silver and over all the precious things of Egypt, and the Libyans and the Ethiopians 
DAN.11.44	But rumors from the east and from the north will alarm 
DAN.11.45	He will pitch his palatial tents between the seas and the glorious Holy Mountain (Zion); yet he will come to his end with no one to help him [in his final battle with God].

DAN.12.4	But as for you, Daniel, conceal these words and seal up the scroll until the end of time. Many will go back and forth 
DAN.12.5	Then I, Daniel, looked, and behold, there stood two others, the one [angel] on this bank of the river and the other [angel] on that bank of the river.

HOS.1.10	Where it is said to them,
HOS.1.10	“You are not My people,”
HOS.1.10	It will be said to them,

HOS.2.2	Contend with your mother (nation); contend,
HOS.2.2	For she is not my wife and I am not her husband;
HOS.2.2	And have her remove her [marks of] prostitution from her face
HOS.2.2	And her adultery from between her breasts
HOS.2.3	Or I will strip her naked
HOS.2.3	And expose her as on the day she was born,
HOS.2.3	And make her like a wilderness
HOS.2.3	And make her like a parched land
HOS.2.3	And slay her with thirst.
HOS.2.4	Also, I will have no mercy on her children,
HOS.2.4	Because they are the children of prostitution.
HOS.2.5	For their mother has played the prostitute;
HOS.2.5	She who conceived them has acted shamefully,
HOS.2.5	For she said, ‘I will pursue my lovers
HOS.2.5	Who give me my food and my water,
HOS.2.5	My wool and my flax, my oil and my [refreshing] drinks.’
HOS.2.6	Therefore, behold, I [the L

HOS.2.7	She will [passionately] pursue her lovers, but she will not overtake them;
HOS.2.7	And she will seek them, but will not find them.
HOS.2.7	Then she will say, ‘Let me go and return to my first husband,
HOS.2.7	For it was better for me then than now!’
HOS.2.8	“For she (Israel) has not noticed

HOS.2.8	Which they used for Baal 
HOS.2.9	Therefore, I will return

HOS.2.11	I will also put an end to all her rejoicing,
HOS.2.11	Her feasts, her New Moons, her Sabbaths,

HOS.2.12	I will destroy her vines and her fig trees
HOS.2.12	Of which she has said, ‘These are my wages
HOS.2.12	Which my lovers have given me.’
HOS.2.12	And I will make them a forest,
HOS.2.12	And the animals of the open country will devour them.
HOS.2.13	And I will punish her for the [feast] days of the Baals,
HOS.2.13	When she used to offer sacrifices

HOS.2.18	And with the birds of the heavens
HOS.2.18	And with the creeping things of the ground.
HOS.2.18	And I will abolish the bow and the sword and [banish] war from the land
HOS.2.18	And will make them lie down in safety.
HOS.2.19	And I will betroth you (Israel) to Me forever;
HOS.2.19	Yes, I will betroth you to Me in righteousness and in justice,
HOS.2.19	In lovingkindness 
HOS.2.20	I will betroth you to Me in stability

HOS.2.22	And the earth shall respond to the grain and the new wine and the oil [which beg it to bring them forth],
HOS.2.22	And they will respond to Jezreel [My Israel, who will now be restored].
HOS.2.23	I will sow her for Myself in the land.
HOS.2.23	I will also have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy;

HOS.3.1	Then the L
HOS.3.2	So I bought her for myself for

HOS.3.4	For the sons of Israel will remain for many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or [idolatrous] pillar, and without 
HOS.3.5	Afterward the sons of Israel will return [in deep repentance] and seek the L
HOS.4.1	Hear the word of the L
HOS.4.1	For the L
HOS.4.1	Because there is no faithfulness [no steadfast love, no dependability] or loyalty 
HOS.4.1	Or knowledge of God [from personal experience with Him] in the land.
HOS.4.2	There is [false] swearing 
HOS.4.2	They employ violence, so that one [act of] bloodshed follows closely on another.
HOS.4.3	Therefore the land [continually] mourns,
HOS.4.3	And everyone who lives in it languishes [in tragic suffering]
HOS.4.3	Together with the animals of the open country and the birds of the heavens;
HOS.4.3	Even the fish of the sea disappear.
HOS.4.4	Yet let no one find fault, nor let any rebuke [others];
HOS.4.4	For your people are like those who contend with the priest.
HOS.4.5	So you will stumble in the daytime,
HOS.4.5	And the [false] prophet will also stumble with you in the night;
HOS.4.5	And I will destroy your mother (Israel).
HOS.4.6	My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge [of My law, where I reveal My will].
HOS.4.6	Because you [the priestly nation] have rejected knowledge,
HOS.4.6	I will also reject you from being My priest.
HOS.4.6	Since you have forgotten the law of your God,
HOS.4.6	I will also forget your children.
HOS.4.7	The more they multiplied [in numbers and increased in power], the more they sinned against Me;
HOS.4.7	I will change their glory into shame.
HOS.4.8	They (the priests) 
HOS.4.8	And set their heart on their wickedness.
HOS.4.9	And it shall be: like people, like priest [both are wicked and both will be judged];
HOS.4.9	So I will punish them for their ways
HOS.4.9	And repay them for their deeds.
HOS.4.10	They will eat, but not have enough;
HOS.4.10	They will play the prostitute, but not increase [their descendants],
HOS.4.10	Because they have stopped giving heed to the L
HOS.4.11	Prostitution, wine, and new wine take away the mind 
HOS.4.12	My people consult their [lifeless] wooden idol, and their [diviner’s] wand gives them oracles.
HOS.4.12	For a spirit of prostitution has led them astray [morally and spiritually],
HOS.4.12	And they have played the prostitute, 
HOS.4.13	They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains
HOS.4.13	And burn incense on the hills,
HOS.4.13	Under oaks, poplars, and terebinths,
HOS.4.13	Because the shade is pleasant there.
HOS.4.13	Therefore your daughters play the prostitute
HOS.4.13	And your brides commit adultery.
HOS.4.14	I will not punish your daughters when they play the prostitute
HOS.4.14	Or your brides when they commit adultery,
HOS.4.14	For the men themselves slip away with prostitutes,
HOS.4.14	And they offer sacrifices with temple prostitutes [who give their bodies in honor of the idol].
HOS.4.14	So the people without understanding [stumble and fall and] come to ruin.
HOS.4.15	Though you, Israel, play the prostitute [by worshiping idols],
HOS.4.15	Do not let Judah become guilty [of the same thing];
HOS.4.15	And do not go to Gilgal [where idols are worshiped],
HOS.4.15	Or go up to 
HOS.4.15	Nor swear [oaths in idolatrous worship, saying],
HOS.4.15	“As the L

HOS.4.17	So let him alone [to suffer the consequences].
HOS.4.18	When their liquor is gone [and their drinking parties are over],
HOS.4.18	They habitually go to play the prostitute;
HOS.4.18	Ephraim’s rulers continue to dearly love shame [more than her glory which is the L
HOS.4.19	The wind [of God’s relentless wrath] has wrapped up Israel in its wings,
HOS.4.19	And [in captivity] they will be ashamed because of their sacrifices [to calves, to sun, to moon, to stars, and to pagan gods].
HOS.5.1	Hear this 
HOS.5.1	Give heed, O house of Israel!
HOS.5.1	Listen, O house of the king!
HOS.5.1	For the [pronounced] judgment pertains to you 
HOS.5.1	Because you have been a snare at Mizpah
HOS.5.1	And a net spread out over Tabor (military strongholds on either side of the Jordan River).
HOS.5.2	The revolters have gone deep into depravity,
HOS.5.2	But I [the L
HOS.5.3	I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from Me;
HOS.5.3	For now, O Ephraim, you have played the prostitute 
HOS.5.3	Israel has defiled itself.
HOS.5.4	Their [immoral] practices will not permit them
HOS.5.4	To return to their God,
HOS.5.4	For the spirit of prostitution is within them
HOS.5.4	And they do not know the L
HOS.5.5	But the pride 
HOS.5.5	Therefore Israel, and [especially] 
HOS.5.6	They will go with their flocks and with their herds
HOS.5.6	To seek the L
HOS.5.6	He has withdrawn from them [refusing to hear the prayers of the unrepentant].
HOS.5.7	They have dealt treacherously against the L
HOS.5.7	For they have borne illegitimate (pagan) children.
HOS.5.7	Now the 
HOS.5.8	Blow the horn in Gibeah,
HOS.5.8	The trumpet in Ramah [the lofty hills on Benjamin’s northern border].
HOS.5.8	Sound the alarm at Beth-aven:
HOS.5.8	“Behind you 
HOS.5.9	Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke;
HOS.5.9	Among the tribes of Israel I declare what is certain.
HOS.5.10	The princes of Judah are like those who 
HOS.5.10	I will pour out My wrath on them like [an unrestrained flood of] water.
HOS.5.11	Ephraim is oppressed; he is broken 
HOS.5.11	Because he was determined to follow 
HOS.5.12	Therefore I am like a moth to Ephraim
HOS.5.12	And like dry rot to the house of Judah [in My judgment against them].
HOS.5.13	When Ephraim saw his sickness,
HOS.5.13	And Judah his wound,
HOS.5.13	Then Ephraim went to Assyria [instead of the L
HOS.5.13	And sent to [Assyria’s] great King Jareb [for help].
HOS.5.13	But he cannot heal you
HOS.5.13	Nor will he cure you of your wound [received in judgment].
HOS.5.14	For I 
HOS.5.14	And like a young lion to the house of Judah.
HOS.5.14	I, even I, will tear to pieces and go on [tearing];
HOS.5.14	I will carry off [the prey] and there will be no one to rescue 
HOS.5.15	I will go away and return to My place [on high]
HOS.5.15	Until they acknowledge their offense 
HOS.5.15	In their distress they will earnestly seek Me, 
HOS.6.1	“Come and let us return [in repentance] to the L
HOS.6.1	For He has torn us, but He will heal us;
HOS.6.1	He has wounded us, but He will bandage us.
HOS.6.2	After two days He will revive us;
HOS.6.2	On the third day He will raise us up
HOS.6.2	That we may live before Him.
HOS.6.3	So let us know 
HOS.6.3	His appearing is prepared 
HOS.6.3	And He will come to us [in salvation] like the [heavy] rain,
HOS.6.3	Like the spring rain watering the earth.”
HOS.6.4	O Ephraim, what shall I do with you?
HOS.6.4	O Judah, what shall I do with you?
HOS.6.4	For your [wavering] loyalty 
HOS.6.4	And like the dew that goes away early.
HOS.6.5	Therefore, I have hewn them in pieces by [the words of] the prophets;
HOS.6.5	I have slain them by the words of My mouth;
HOS.6.5	My judgments [pronounced upon them by the prophets] are like the light that shines forth [obvious to all].
HOS.6.6	For I desire 
HOS.6.6	And in the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.
HOS.6.7	But they, like Adam, have transgressed the covenant;
HOS.6.7	There they have dealt treacherously against Me.
HOS.6.8	Gilead is a city of wrongdoers;
HOS.6.8	It is tracked with bloody 
HOS.6.9	And as bands of robbers [lie in] wait for a man,
HOS.6.9	So a band of priests murder on the road toward

HOS.6.10	I have seen a horrible thing [sins of every kind] in the house of Israel!
HOS.6.10	Ephraim’s prostitution (idolatry) is there; Israel has defiled itself.
HOS.6.11	Also, O Judah, there is a harvest [of divine judgment] appointed for you,
HOS.6.11	When I restore the fortunes of My people [who have been slaves to the misery of sin].
HOS.7.1	When I would heal Israel,
HOS.7.1	The sin (guilt) of Ephraim is uncovered,
HOS.7.1	And the wickedness of 
HOS.7.1	Because they practice false dealing;
HOS.7.1	The thief enters,
HOS.7.1	Bandits ravage 
HOS.7.2	But they do not consider in their hearts (minds)
HOS.7.2	That I remember [always] all their wickedness.
HOS.7.2	Now their deeds surround 
HOS.7.2	They are before My face.
HOS.7.3	They make the king glad with their wickedness,
HOS.7.3	And the princes with their lies.
HOS.7.4	They are all adulterers;
HOS.7.4	Like the heat of an oven
HOS.7.4	When the baker ceases to stir 
HOS.7.4	From the kneading of the dough until it is leavened.
HOS.7.5	On the [special] day of our king, the princes became sick with the heat of wine;
HOS.7.5	The king stretched out his hand [in association] with scoffers (lawless people).
HOS.7.6	As they approach their plotting,
HOS.7.6	Their mind burns [with intrigue] like an oven [while they lie in wait].
HOS.7.6	Their anger smolders all night;
HOS.7.6	In the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.
HOS.7.7	They are all hot like an oven
HOS.7.7	And they consume their judges (rulers);
HOS.7.7	All their kings have fallen.
HOS.7.7	There is no one among them who calls to Me.
HOS.7.8	Ephraim mixes himself with the [Gentile] nations [seeking favor with one country, then another];
HOS.7.8	Ephraim is a cake not turned [worthless; ready to be thrown away].
HOS.7.9	Strangers have devoured his strength,
HOS.7.9	Yet he does not know it;
HOS.7.9	Gray hairs are sprinkled on him,
HOS.7.9	Yet he does not know.
HOS.7.10	Though the pride of Israel testifies against him,
HOS.7.10	Yet they do not return [in repentance] to the L
HOS.7.10	Nor seek 
HOS.7.11	Ephraim also is like a silly dove, without heart 
HOS.7.11	They call to Egypt [for help], they go to Assyria.
HOS.7.12	When they go, I will spread My net over them;
HOS.7.12	I will bring them down like birds of the heavens [into Assyrian captivity].
HOS.7.12	I will chastise them in accordance with the proclamation (prophecy) to their congregation.
HOS.7.13	Woe (judgment is coming) to them, for they have wandered away from Me!
HOS.7.13	Devastation is theirs, because they have rebelled 
HOS.7.13	I would redeem them, but they speak lies against Me.
HOS.7.14	They do not cry out to Me from their heart
HOS.7.14	When they wail on their beds [in unbelieving despair];
HOS.7.14	For the sake of grain and new wine they 
HOS.7.14	They rebel against Me.
HOS.7.15	Although I trained and strengthened their arms [for victory over their enemies],
HOS.7.15	Yet they devise evil against Me.
HOS.7.16	They turn, but they do not turn upward to the Most High.
HOS.7.16	They are like a poorly crafted bow [that misses the mark];
HOS.7.16	Their princes shall fall by the sword
HOS.7.16	Because of the insolence of their tongue.
HOS.7.16	This 
HOS.8.1	Set the trumpet to your lips [announcing impending judgment]!
HOS.8.1	Like a [great] vulture 
HOS.8.1	Because they have broken My covenant
HOS.8.1	And transgressed 
HOS.8.2	Then they will cry out to Me,
HOS.8.2	“My God, we of Israel know You!”
HOS.8.3	Israel has rejected the good;
HOS.8.3	The enemy shall pursue him.
HOS.8.4	They set up kings, but not from Me [therefore without My blessing];
HOS.8.4	They have appointed princes, but I did not know it.
HOS.8.4	With their silver and their gold they made idols for themselves,
HOS.8.4	That they might be cut off.
HOS.8.5	He has rejected your [pagan] calf, O Samaria, 
HOS.8.5	“My wrath burns against them.”
HOS.8.5	How long will they be incapable of innocence?
HOS.8.6	For even this [loathsome calf] is from Israel.
HOS.8.6	A craftsman made it, so it is not God;
HOS.8.6	Surely the calf of Samaria will be broken to pieces 
HOS.8.7	For they sow the wind [in evil]
HOS.8.7	And they reap the whirlwind [in disaster].
HOS.8.7	The standing grain has no growth;
HOS.8.7	It yields no grain.
HOS.8.7	If it were to yield, strangers would swallow it up.
HOS.8.8	Israel is [as if] swallowed up [by enemies];
HOS.8.8	They are now among the nations
HOS.8.8	Like a vessel [of cheap, coarse pottery] that is useless.
HOS.8.9	For they have gone up to Assyria,
HOS.8.9	Like a wild donkey wandering alone 
HOS.8.9	Ephraim has hired lovers (pagan allies).
HOS.8.10	Yes, even though [with presents] they hire 
HOS.8.10	Now I will gather them up;
HOS.8.10	And [in a little while] they will begin 
HOS.8.10	Because of the burden imposed by the king of princes [the king of Assyria].
HOS.8.11	For Ephraim has constructed many altars for sin;
HOS.8.11	They are altars intended for sinning [which multiply his guilt].
HOS.8.12	I wrote for him the ten thousand 
HOS.8.12	But they are regarded as a strange thing [which does not concern him].
HOS.8.13	As for My sacrificial offerings,
HOS.8.13	They sacrifice the meat [as a mere formality] and eat it,
HOS.8.13	But the L
HOS.8.13	Now He will remember 
HOS.8.13	And punish them for their sins.
HOS.8.13	They will return [in captivity] to [another] Egypt [that is, Assyria].
HOS.8.14	For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces [and pagan temples],
HOS.8.14	And Judah has built many fortified cities;
HOS.8.14	But I will send a fire upon their cities so that it may consume their palaces 
HOS.9.1	Do not rejoice, O Israel, with exultation as do the [pagan] peoples,
HOS.9.1	For you have played the prostitute, 
HOS.9.1	You have loved 
HOS.9.2	The threshing floor and the wine press will no longer feed them,
HOS.9.2	And the new wine will fail them [because they failed to honor the God who provides].
HOS.9.3	They will not remain in the land of the L
HOS.9.3	But Ephraim will return to [another] Egypt [in bondage]
HOS.9.3	And they will eat [ceremonially] unclean 
HOS.9.4	They will not pour out drink offerings of wine to the L
HOS.9.4	Their sacrifices will not please Him.
HOS.9.4	All who eat it will be [ceremonially] unclean,
HOS.9.4	For their bread will be for themselves;
HOS.9.4	It will not enter the house of the L
HOS.9.5	What will you do on the day of the appointed festival
HOS.9.5	And on the day of the feast of the L
HOS.9.6	For behold, they will go away because of devastation 
HOS.9.6	Egypt will gather them up, Memphis will bury them.
HOS.9.6	Weeds will take over their treasures of silver;
HOS.9.6	Thorns 
HOS.9.7	The days of punishment have come;
HOS.9.7	The days of retribution are at hand;
HOS.9.7	Let Israel know this!
HOS.9.7	The prophet is [considered] a fool;
HOS.9.7	The man [of God] who is inspired is [treated as if] demented,
HOS.9.7	Because of the abundance of your wickedness 
HOS.9.7	And 
HOS.9.8	Ephraim was a watchman with my God, a [true] prophet [to warn the nation];
HOS.9.8	But the snare of a bird catcher was laid in all his paths.
HOS.9.8	And there is 
HOS.9.9	They have deeply corrupted (perverted) themselves
HOS.9.9	As in the days of Gibeah.
HOS.9.9	The L
HOS.9.9	He will punish their sins.
HOS.9.10	I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness [an unexpected and refreshing delight];
HOS.9.10	I saw your fathers (ancestors) as the first ripe fruit on the fig tree in its first 
HOS.9.10	But they came to Baal-peor and consecrated themselves to shamefulness [the worship of Baal],
HOS.9.10	And [because of their spiritual and physical adultery] they became as detestable 
HOS.9.11	As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird;
HOS.9.11	No birth, no pregnancy, and [because of their impurity] no conception.
HOS.9.12	Even though they bring up their children,
HOS.9.12	Yet I will bereave them until not one is left.
HOS.9.12	Indeed, woe (judgment is coming) to them when I look away 
HOS.9.13	Ephraim, as I have seen,
HOS.9.13	Is planted in a pleasant [and prosperous] meadow like Tyre;
HOS.9.13	But Ephraim will bring out his children to the executioner [for slaughter].
HOS.9.14	Give them [the punishment they deserve], O L
HOS.9.14	Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.
HOS.9.15	All their wickedness [says the L
HOS.9.15	Indeed, I came to hate them there!
HOS.9.15	Because of the wickedness of their [idolatrous] practices
HOS.9.15	I will drive them out of My house (the land of Israel)!
HOS.9.15	I will love them no longer;
HOS.9.15	All their princes are rebels.
HOS.9.16	Ephraim is stricken, their root is dried up,
HOS.9.16	They will bear no fruit.
HOS.9.16	Even though they give birth,
HOS.9.16	I will slay the precious children of their womb.
HOS.9.17	My God will reject them 
HOS.9.17	Because they did not listen to Him;
HOS.9.17	And they will be wanderers (fugitives) among the nations.
HOS.10.1	Israel is a luxuriant 
HOS.10.1	He produces fruit for himself.
HOS.10.1	The more his fruit,
HOS.10.1	The more altars he made [to Baal];
HOS.10.1	The richer his land,
HOS.10.1	The better he made the [idolatrous] pillars.
HOS.10.2	Their heart is divided (faithless);
HOS.10.2	Now they must bear their guilt 
HOS.10.2	The L
HOS.10.2	He will destroy their 
HOS.10.3	Surely now they will say [in despair], “We have no [true] king,
HOS.10.3	For we do not revere the L
HOS.10.3	And as for the king, what can he do for us [to rescue us]?”
HOS.10.4	They have spoken 
HOS.10.4	Swearing falsely to make covenants [they intend to break];
HOS.10.4	Therefore, judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.
HOS.10.5	The people of Samaria will fear 
HOS.10.5	For the [idolatrous] calf of 
HOS.10.5	Indeed, its people will mourn over it
HOS.10.5	And its idolatrous priests will cry out 
HOS.10.5	Over its glory, because the glory [of their calf god] has departed from it.
HOS.10.6	The golden calf itself will be carried to Assyria
HOS.10.6	As tribute to King Jareb;
HOS.10.6	Ephraim will be seized with shame
HOS.10.6	And Israel will be ashamed of his own counsel [to worship the calf and separate Israel from Judah].
HOS.10.7	As for Samaria, her king will be cut off 
HOS.10.7	Like a twig on the surface of the water.
HOS.10.8	Also the high places of Aven (Beth-aven), the sin of Israel, will be destroyed;
HOS.10.8	The thorn and the thistle will grow on their [pagan] altars,
HOS.10.8	And [in despair] they will say to the mountains,
HOS.10.8	“Cover us!” And to the hills, “Fall on us!”
HOS.10.9	O Israel, you have [willfully] sinned since the days of Gibeah;
HOS.10.9	There they (Israel) stand!
HOS.10.9	Will not the battle against the sons of wickedness overtake them at Gibeah?
HOS.10.10	When it is my desire [to defend My righteousness], I will chastise them;
HOS.10.10	And [hostile] peoples will be gathered against them
HOS.10.10	When they are bound 
HOS.10.11	Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to tread out the grain,
HOS.10.11	But I will come over her fair neck 
HOS.10.11	I will harness Ephraim;
HOS.10.11	Judah will plow and Jacob will harrow 
HOS.10.12	Sow with a view to righteousness [that righteousness, like seed, may germinate];
HOS.10.12	Reap in accordance with mercy 
HOS.10.12	Break up your uncultivated ground,
HOS.10.12	For it is time to seek 
HOS.10.12	Until He comes to rain righteousness 
HOS.10.13	You have plowed 
HOS.10.13	You have eaten the fruit of lies.
HOS.10.13	Because you have trusted in your own way 
HOS.10.14	Therefore an uproar will arise among your people,
HOS.10.14	And all your fortresses will be destroyed,
HOS.10.14	As Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel on the day of battle,
HOS.10.14	When mothers were dashed in pieces with their children.
HOS.10.15	In this way it will be done to you at [idolatrous] Bethel because of your great wickedness;
HOS.10.15	At daybreak the king of Israel will be completely cut off.
HOS.11.1	When Israel was a child [a young nation], I loved him,
HOS.11.1	And I called My son out of Egypt.
HOS.11.2	The more they [the prophets] called them [to repentance and obedience],
HOS.11.2	The more they went away from them;
HOS.11.2	They kept sacrificing to the Baals
HOS.11.2	And burning incense to the carved images.
HOS.11.3	Yet it is I who taught Ephraim to walk,
HOS.11.3	Taking them in My arms [nurturing the young nation];
HOS.11.3	But they did not know that I healed them.
HOS.11.4	I led them 
HOS.11.4	And I was to them as one who lifts up 
HOS.11.4	And I bent down to them and fed them.
HOS.11.5	They will not return to the land of Egypt,
HOS.11.5	But Assyria will be their king [bringing them into captivity]
HOS.11.5	Because they refused to return 
HOS.11.6	The sword will whirl against 
HOS.11.6	And will demolish the bars of their gates 
HOS.11.6	And will consume them because of their counsels.
HOS.11.7	My people are bent on turning from Me;
HOS.11.7	Though the prophets call them to 
HOS.11.7	None at all exalts 
HOS.11.8	How can I give you up, O Ephraim?
HOS.11.8	How can I surrender you, O Israel?
HOS.11.8	How can I make you like Admah?
HOS.11.8	How can I treat you like 
HOS.11.8	My heart recoils within Me;
HOS.11.8	All My compassions are kindled together [for My nation of Israel].
HOS.11.9	I will not execute the fierceness of My anger;
HOS.11.9	I will not return to Ephraim to destroy him again.
HOS.11.9	For I am God and not man, the Holy One in your midst [who will not revoke My covenant],
HOS.11.9	And I will not come in wrath 
HOS.11.10	They will walk after the L
HOS.11.10	Who will roar like a lion;
HOS.11.10	He will roar [summoning them]
HOS.11.10	And 
HOS.11.11	They will come trembling 
HOS.11.11	And like doves from the land of Assyria;
HOS.11.11	And I will settle them in their houses [in the land of their inheritance], declares the L
HOS.11.12	Ephraim surrounds Me with lies
HOS.11.12	And the house of Israel with deceit;
HOS.11.12	Judah is also unruly against God,
HOS.11.12	Even against the faithful Holy One.
HOS.12.1	Ephraim feeds on the [emptiness of the] wind
HOS.12.1	And [continually] pursues the [parching] east wind [which brings destruction];
HOS.12.1	Every day he multiplies lies and violence.
HOS.12.1	Further, he makes a covenant with Assyria
HOS.12.1	And (olive) oil is carried to Egypt [to seek alliances].
HOS.12.2	The L
HOS.12.2	And He will punish Jacob in accordance with his ways;
HOS.12.2	He will repay him in accordance with his deeds.
HOS.12.3	In 
HOS.12.3	And in his maturity he contended with God.
HOS.12.4	He wrestled with the angel and prevailed;
HOS.12.4	He wept [in repentance] and sought His favor.
HOS.12.4	He met Him at Bethel
HOS.12.4	And there God spoke with [him and through him with] us—
HOS.12.5	Even the L
HOS.12.5	The name of Him [who spoke with Jacob] is the L
HOS.12.6	Therefore, return [in repentance] to your God,
HOS.12.6	Observe 
HOS.12.6	And wait [expectantly] for your God continually.
HOS.12.7	A merchant, in whose hand are false 
HOS.12.7	He loves to oppress 
HOS.12.8	Ephraim said, “I have indeed become rich [and powerful as a nation];
HOS.12.8	I have found wealth for myself.
HOS.12.8	In all my labors they will not find in me
HOS.12.8	Any wickedness that 
HOS.12.9	But I 
HOS.12.9	I will make you live in tents again,
HOS.12.9	As in the days of the appointed 
HOS.12.10	I have also spoken to [you through] the prophets,
HOS.12.10	And I gave [them] many visions [to make My will known],
HOS.12.10	And through the prophets I gave parables [to appeal to your sense of right and wrong].
HOS.12.11	Is there wickedness (idolatry) in Gilead?
HOS.12.11	Surely the people there are worthless.
HOS.12.11	In Gilgal [they defy Me when] they sacrifice bulls,
HOS.12.11	Yes, [after My judgment] their [pagan] altars are like the stone heaps
HOS.12.11	In the furrows of the fields.
HOS.12.12	Now Jacob (Israel) fled into the open country of Aram (Paddan-aram),
HOS.12.12	And [there] Israel (Jacob) worked 
HOS.12.12	And for a wife he kept 
HOS.12.13	And by a prophet (Moses) the L
HOS.12.13	And by a prophet Israel was preserved.
HOS.12.14	Ephraim has provoked most bitter anger;
HOS.12.14	So his Lord will leave his bloodguilt on him [invoking punishment]
HOS.12.14	And bring back to him his shame 
HOS.13.1	When Ephraim spoke, 
HOS.13.1	He exalted himself [above the other tribes] in Israel;
HOS.13.1	But through [the worship of] Baal he became guilty and died [spiritually, and then came ruin, sealing Israel’s doom as a nation].
HOS.13.2	And now they sin more and more,
HOS.13.2	And make for themselves molten images,
HOS.13.2	Idols skillfully made from their silver [as it pleased them],
HOS.13.2	All of them the work of the craftsmen.
HOS.13.2	They say of these [very works of their hands], “Let those who sacrifice kiss 
HOS.13.3	Therefore they will be [swiftly dissipated] like the morning cloud
HOS.13.3	Or like dew which soon disappears,
HOS.13.3	Like chaff which swirls with the whirlwind from the threshing floor,
HOS.13.3	And like smoke from the chimney 
HOS.13.4	Yet I 
HOS.13.4	Since [the time you became a nation in] the land of Egypt;
HOS.13.4	And you were not to know any god except Me,
HOS.13.4	For there is no savior besides Me.
HOS.13.5	I knew 
HOS.13.5	In the land of drought.
HOS.13.6	When 
HOS.13.6	And being satisfied, their heart became proud (self-centered);
HOS.13.6	Therefore they forgot Me.
HOS.13.7	So I will be like a lion to them;
HOS.13.7	Like a leopard I will watch 
HOS.13.8	I will encounter them like a bear robbed of her cubs,
HOS.13.8	And I will tear open their chests;
HOS.13.8	There I will also devour them like a lioness,
HOS.13.8	As a wild beast would tear them.
HOS.13.9	It is your destruction, O Israel,
HOS.13.9	Because 
HOS.13.10	Where now is your king
HOS.13.10	That he may save you [when you are attacked] in all your cities?
HOS.13.10	And your judges of whom you asked,
HOS.13.10	“Give me a king and princes”?
HOS.13.11	I gave you a king in My anger,
HOS.13.11	And I took him away in My wrath [as punishment].
HOS.13.12	The wickedness of Ephraim [which is not yet completely punished] is bound up [as in a bag];
HOS.13.12	His sin is stored up [for judgment and destruction].
HOS.13.13	The pains of childbirth come on him;
HOS.13.13	But he is not a wise son,
HOS.13.13	For it is not the time to delay [his chance at a new birth] as the womb opens [but he ignores the opportunity to change].
HOS.13.14	Shall I ransom them from the power of Sheol (the place of the dead)?
HOS.13.14	Shall I redeem them from death?
HOS.13.14	O Sheol, where is your sting?
HOS.13.14	Compassion is hidden from My eyes [because of their failure to repent].
HOS.13.15	For though he flourishes among the reeds (his fellow tribes),
HOS.13.15	An east wind (Assyria) will come,
HOS.13.15	The breath of the L
HOS.13.15	And Ephraim’s spring will become dry
HOS.13.15	And his fountain will be dried up.
HOS.13.15	Assyria will plunder his treasury of every precious object.
HOS.13.16	Samaria will be found guilty [and become desolate],
HOS.13.16	Because she rebelled against her God;
HOS.13.16	They will fall by the sword,
HOS.13.16	Their infants will be dashed in pieces,
HOS.13.16	And their pregnant women will be ripped open.
HOS.14.1	O Israel, return [in repentance] to the L
HOS.14.1	For you have stumbled 
HOS.14.2	Take the words [confessing your guilt] with you and return to the L
HOS.14.2	Say to Him, “Take away all our wickedness;
HOS.14.2	Accept what is good 
HOS.14.2	So that we may present the fruit of our lips (gratitude).
HOS.14.3	Assyria will not save us;
HOS.14.3	We will not ride on horses [relying on military might],

HOS.14.3	‘You are our gods.’
HOS.14.3	For in You [O L
HOS.14.4	I will heal their apostasy 
HOS.14.4	I will love them freely,

JOL.1.11	Be ashamed, O farmers;

AMO.4.6	“I also gave you cleanness of teeth [because of the famine] in all your cities
AMO.4.6	And lack of bread in all your places,

AMO.4.7	When 
AMO.4.7	Then I would send rain on one city,
AMO.4.7	And on another city I would not send rain;
AMO.4.7	One piece of ground was rained on,
AMO.4.7	While the part not rained on would dry up.
AMO.4.8	So [the people of] two or three cities would stagger into one city to drink water,

AMO.4.10	“I sent a plague among you like [those of] Egypt;
AMO.4.10	I killed your young men with the sword and I captured your horses,

AMO.4.13	He who makes the dawn into darkness
AMO.4.13	And treads on the heights of the earth—
AMO.4.13	The L

AMO.5.2	She has fallen, she will not rise again—
AMO.5.2	The virgin Israel.
AMO.5.2	She lies neglected on her land;
AMO.5.2	There is no one to raise her up.
AMO.5.3	For thus says the Lord G
AMO.5.3	“The city which goes forth a thousand 
AMO.5.3	Will have a hundred left,
AMO.5.3	And the one which goes forth a hundred 
AMO.5.3	Will have ten left to the house of Israel.”
AMO.5.4	For thus says the L
AMO.5.4	“Seek Me [search diligently for Me and regard Me as more essential than food] so that you may live.
AMO.5.5	But do not resort to Bethel [to worship the golden calf]
AMO.5.5	Nor enter [idolatrous] Gilgal,
AMO.5.5	Nor cross over to Beersheba [and its idols];
AMO.5.5	For Gilgal will certainly go into captivity 
AMO.5.5	And Bethel will come to nothing.
AMO.5.6	Seek the L
AMO.5.6	Or He will rush down like a [devouring] fire, O 
AMO.5.6	And there will be no one to quench the flame for [idolatrous]

AMO.5.7	And cast righteousness down to the earth.”
AMO.5.8	He who made the [cluster of stars called] Pleiades and [the constellation] Orion,
AMO.5.8	Who turns deep darkness into the morning
AMO.5.8	And darkens the day into night,
AMO.5.8	Who calls for the waters of the sea
AMO.5.8	And pours them out on the surface of the earth,

AMO.5.10	They hate the one who reprimands [the unrighteous] in the [court held at the city] gate [regarding him as unreasonable and rejecting his reprimand],
AMO.5.10	And they detest him who speaks [the truth] with integrity 
AMO.5.11	Therefore, because you impose heavy rent on the poor
AMO.5.11	And demand a tribute (food-tax) of grain from them,
AMO.5.11	Though you have built [luxurious] houses of square stone,
AMO.5.11	You will not live in them;
AMO.5.11	You have planted beautiful vineyards, but you will not drink their wine.
AMO.5.12	For I know your transgressions are many and your sins are great (shocking, innumerable),
AMO.5.12	You who distress the righteous and take bribes,
AMO.5.12	And turn away from the poor in the [court of the city] gate [depriving them of justice].
AMO.5.13	Therefore, he who is prudent 
AMO.5.14	Seek (long for, require) good and not evil, that you may live;
AMO.5.14	And so may the L
AMO.5.14	Just as you have said!
AMO.5.15	Hate evil and love good,
AMO.5.15	And establish justice in the [court of the city] gate.
AMO.5.15	Perhaps the L
AMO.5.15	Will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph [that is, those who remain after God’s judgment].
AMO.5.16	Therefore, thus says the L
AMO.5.16	“There is wailing in all the public plazas,
AMO.5.16	And in all the streets they say, ‘Alas! Alas!’
AMO.5.16	And they call the farmers to mourning [for those who have died]
AMO.5.16	And professional mourners to wailing.
AMO.5.17	And in all vineyards 
AMO.5.17	For I will pass through your midst [in judgment],” says the L
AMO.5.18	Woe (judgment is coming) to you who desire the day of the L
AMO.5.18	Why would you want the day of the L
AMO.5.18	It is darkness (judgment) and not light [and rescue and prosperity];
AMO.5.19	It is as if a man runs from a lion [escaping one danger]
AMO.5.19	And a bear meets him [so he dies anyway],
AMO.5.19	Or goes home, and leans with his hand against the wall
AMO.5.19	And a snake bites him.
AMO.5.20	Will not the day of the L
AMO.5.20	Even very dark with no brightness in it?
AMO.5.21	“I hate, I despise 
AMO.5.21	And I do not take delight in your solemn assemblies.
AMO.5.22	Even though you offer Me your burnt offerings and your grain offerings,
AMO.5.22	I will not accept them;
AMO.5.22	And I will not even look at the peace offerings of your fattened animals.
AMO.5.23	Take the noise of your songs away from Me [they are an irritation]!
AMO.5.23	I shall not even listen to the melody of your harps.
AMO.5.24	But let justice run down like waters
AMO.5.24	And righteousness like an ever-flowing stream [flowing abundantly].
AMO.5.25	“Did you bring Me sacrifices and grain offerings during those forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel? [Certainly not!] 
AMO.5.26	You carried along your king Sikkuth and Kayyun [your man-made gods of Saturn], your images of your star-god which you made for yourselves [but you brought Me none of the appointed sacrifices]. 
AMO.5.27	Therefore, I will send you to go into exile far beyond Damascus,” says the L
AMO.6.1	Woe (judgment is coming) to those who are at ease 
AMO.6.1	And to those on the mountain of Samaria who feel secure,
AMO.6.1	The distinguished men of the foremost of nations,
AMO.6.1	To whom the house of Israel comes.
AMO.6.2	Go over to Calneh [in Babylonia] and look,
AMO.6.2	And from there go [north of Damascus] to the great city of Hamath;
AMO.6.2	Then go down to Gath of the Philistines.
AMO.6.2	Are they better than these kingdoms [of yours],
AMO.6.2	Or is their territory greater than yours?
AMO.6.3	Do you put off the day of punishment,
AMO.6.3	Yet cause the seat of violence to come near?
AMO.6.4	Those who lie on [luxurious] beds of ivory
AMO.6.4	And lounge around out on their couches,
AMO.6.4	And eat lambs from the flock
AMO.6.4	And calves from the midst of the stall,
AMO.6.5	Who improvise to the sound of the harp—
AMO.6.5	Like David they have composed songs for themselves—
AMO.6.6	Who drink wine from sacrificial bowls
AMO.6.6	And anoint themselves with the finest oils [reflecting their unrestrained celebration];
AMO.6.6	Yet they are not grieved over the ruin of Joseph (Israel).
AMO.6.7	Therefore, they will now go into exile with the first of the captives,
AMO.6.7	And the cultic revelry 
AMO.6.8	The Lord 
AMO.6.8	“I loathe 
AMO.6.8	And I hate his palaces 
AMO.6.8	Therefore, I shall hand over the [idolatrous] city [of Samaria] with all that it contains [to the Assyrian invaders].”
AMO.6.9	And it shall come to pass that if there remain ten men in one house, they shall die [by the pestilence that comes with war]. 
AMO.6.10	Then one’s uncle, or his undertaker, shall come to bring the [disease-infected] body out of the house, [to cremate it], and he will say to another in the farthest part of the house, “Is there anyone else with you?” And that one will say, “No one.” Then he will respond, “Hush! Keep quiet! For the name of the L
AMO.6.11	For behold, the L
AMO.6.12	Do horses run on rocks?
AMO.6.12	Do men plow rocks with oxen? [Of course not!]
AMO.6.12	Yet you have turned justice into poison
AMO.6.12	And the fruit of righteousness into wormwood (bitterness),
AMO.6.13	You who [self-confidently] rejoice in 
AMO.6.13	Who say, “Have we not by our own strength taken 
AMO.6.14	“For behold, I am going to stir up a nation against you,
AMO.6.14	O house of Israel,” says the L
AMO.6.14	“And they will afflict 
AMO.6.14	To the brook of the Arabah [in the south].”
AMO.7.1	Thus the Lord G
AMO.7.2	And when the locusts had finished eating the plants of the land, then I said,
AMO.7.2	“O Lord G
AMO.7.2	How can Jacob stand,
AMO.7.2	For he is so small [that he cannot endure this]?”
AMO.7.3	The L
AMO.7.3	“It shall not take place,” said the L
AMO.7.4	Thus the Lord G
AMO.7.5	Then I said,
AMO.7.5	“O Lord G
AMO.7.5	How can Jacob stand,
AMO.7.5	For he is so small [that he cannot endure this]?”
AMO.7.6	The L
AMO.7.6	“This also shall not be,” said the Lord G
AMO.7.7	Thus He showed me [a vision], and behold, the Lord was standing by a vertical wall with a plumb line in His hand [to determine if the wall was straight or if it needed to be destroyed]. 
AMO.7.8	The L
AMO.7.8	“Behold, I am setting a plumb line [as a standard]
AMO.7.8	Among My people Israel [showing the defectiveness of the nation, requiring judgment].
AMO.7.8	I shall not spare them any longer. [The door of mercy is shut.]
AMO.7.9	And the [idolatrous] high places of Isaac (Israel) will be devastated 
AMO.7.9	And the sanctuaries of Israel will be in ruins.
AMO.7.9	Then I shall rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword [and destroy the monarchy].”
AMO.7.10	Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel [site of the golden calf shrine], sent 
AMO.7.11	For in this way Amos has said, ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword and Israel will certainly go from its land into exile.’ ” 
AMO.7.12	Then Amaziah said to Amos, “Go, you seer, run for your life [from Israel] to the land of Judah [your own country] and eat bread and live as a prophet there! 
AMO.7.13	But do not prophesy any longer at Bethel, for it is the king’s sanctuary and a royal residence.”
AMO.7.14	Then Amos replied to Amaziah, “I am not a prophet [by profession], nor am I a prophet’s son; I am a herdsman and a grower of sycamore figs. 
AMO.7.15	But the L
AMO.7.16	Now therefore, listen to the word of the L
AMO.7.17	Therefore, thus says the L
AMO.8.1	Thus the Lord G
AMO.8.2	And He said, “Amos, what do you see?” And I said, “A basket of summer fruit.” Then the L
AMO.8.3	In that day, the songs of the palace shall turn to wailing,” says the Lord G
AMO.8.4	Hear this, you who trample down the needy, and do away with the poor of the land, 
AMO.8.5	saying,
AMO.8.5	“When will the New Moon [festival] be over
AMO.8.5	So that we may sell grain,
AMO.8.5	And the Sabbath ended so that we may open the wheat 
AMO.8.5	Making the ephah [measure] smaller and the shekel bigger [that is, selling less for a higher price]
AMO.8.5	And to cheat by falsifying the scales,
AMO.8.6	So that we may buy the poor [as slaves] for silver [since they are unable to support themselves]
AMO.8.6	And the

AMO.8.7	The L
AMO.8.7	“Surely I shall never forget [nor leave unpunished] any of their [rebellious] acts.
AMO.8.8	Because of this [coming judgment] will the land not quake
AMO.8.8	And everyone mourn who dwells in it?
AMO.8.8	Indeed, all of it shall rise up like the Nile,
AMO.8.8	And it will be tossed around [from the impact of judgment]
AMO.8.8	And [afterward] subside again like the Nile of Egypt.
AMO.8.9	It shall come about in that day,” says the Lord G
AMO.8.9	“That I shall cause the sun to go down at noon,
AMO.8.9	And I shall darken the earth in broad daylight.
AMO.8.10	And I shall turn your festivals 
AMO.8.10	And all your songs into dirges (funeral poems to be sung);
AMO.8.10	And I shall cause sackcloth to be put on everyone’s 
AMO.8.10	And baldness on every head [shaved for mourning].
AMO.8.10	And I shall make that time like 
AMO.8.10	And the end of it shall be like a bitter day.
AMO.8.11	“Behold, the days are coming,” says the Lord G
AMO.8.11	“When I will send hunger over the land,
AMO.8.11	Not hunger for bread or a thirst for water,
AMO.8.11	But rather [a hunger] for hearing the words of the L
AMO.8.12	People shall stagger from sea to sea [to the very ends of the earth]
AMO.8.12	And from the north even to the east;
AMO.8.12	They will roam here and there to seek the word of the L
AMO.8.12	But they will not find it.
AMO.8.13	In that day the beautiful virgins
AMO.8.13	And [even the vigorous] young men shall faint from thirst.
AMO.8.14	Those who swear [their oaths] by the sin (guilt) of Samaria 
AMO.8.14	Who say, ‘By the life of your god [the golden calf], O Dan!’
AMO.8.14	And [swear], ‘By the life of the way of [idolatrous] Beersheba,’
AMO.8.14	They shall fall and not rise again.”
AMO.9.1	I saw [in a vision] the Lord standing at the altar, and He said,
AMO.9.1	“Destroy the capitals (tops) of the pillars so that the thresholds will shake,
AMO.9.1	And break them on the heads of all of the people!
AMO.9.1	Then I will kill the rest of them with the sword;
AMO.9.1	They will not have a fugitive who will get away,
AMO.9.1	Or a survivor who will escape.
AMO.9.2	Though they dig into 
AMO.9.2	From there My hand will take them [for judgment];
AMO.9.2	And though they climb up to heaven [to hide in the realm of light],
AMO.9.2	From there will I bring them down [for judgment].
AMO.9.3	Though they hide on the summit of [Mount] Carmel,
AMO.9.3	I will track them down and take them from there;
AMO.9.3	And though they hide from My sight on the floor of the sea,
AMO.9.3	From there I shall command the serpent and it will bite them.
AMO.9.4	And though they go into captivity before their enemies,
AMO.9.4	From there I shall command the sword to kill them,
AMO.9.4	And I will set My eyes against them for evil (judgment, punishment) and not for good [that is, not for correction leading to restoration].”
AMO.9.5	The Lord G
AMO.9.5	It is He who touches the earth [in judgment] and it melts,
AMO.9.5	And all who dwell on it mourn [in despair and fear],
AMO.9.5	And all of it rises up like the Nile
AMO.9.5	And subsides like the Nile of Egypt;
AMO.9.6	It is He who builds His upper chambers in the heavens
AMO.9.6	And has established His vaulted dome (the firmament of heaven) over the earth,

JON.1.5	Then the sailors were afraid, and each man cried out to his god; and to lighten the ship [and diminish the danger] they threw the ship’s cargo into the sea. But Jonah had gone below into the hold of the ship and had lain down and was sound asleep. 
JON.1.6	So the captain came up to him and said, “How can you stay asleep? Get up! Call on your god! Perhaps your god will give a thought to us so that we will not perish.”
JON.1.7	And they said to another, “Come,

JON.1.11	Then they said to him, “What should we do to you, so that the sea will become calm for us?”—for the sea was becoming more and more violent. 
JON.1.12	Jonah said to them, “Pick me up and throw me into the sea. Then the sea will become calm for you, for I know that it is because of me that this great storm 
JON.1.13	Nevertheless, the men rowed hard [breaking through the waves] to return to land, but they could not, because the sea became even more violent [surging higher] against them. 
JON.1.14	Then they called on the L
JON.1.15	So they picked up Jonah and threw him into the sea, and the sea stopped its raging. 
JON.1.16	Then the men greatly feared the L
JON.1.17	Now the L
JON.2.1	Then Jonah prayed to the L
JON.2.2	and said,
JON.2.2	“I called out of my trouble 
JON.2.2	And He answered me;
JON.2.2	Out of the belly of Sheol I cried for help,
JON.2.2	And You heard my voice.
JON.2.3	For You cast me into the deep,
JON.2.3	Into the [deep] heart of the seas,
JON.2.3	And the currents surrounded 
JON.2.3	All Your breakers and billowing waves passed over me.
JON.2.4	Then I said, ‘I have been cast out of Your sight.
JON.2.4	Nevertheless I will look again toward Your holy temple.’
JON.2.5	The waters surrounded me, to the point of death.
JON.2.5	The great deep engulfed me,
JON.2.5	Seaweed was wrapped around my head.
JON.2.6	I descended to the [very] roots of the mountains.

JON.2.10	So the L
JON.3.1	Now the word of the L
JON.3.2	“Go to Nineveh the great city and declare to it the message which I am going to tell you.” 
JON.3.3	So Jonah went to Nineveh in accordance with the word of the L
JON.3.4	Then on the first day’s walk, Jonah 
JON.3.5	The people of Nineveh believed 
JON.3.6	When word reached the king of Nineveh [of Jonah’s message from God], he rose from his throne, took off his robe, covered himself with sackcloth and sat in the dust [in repentance]. 
JON.3.7	He issued a proclamation and it said, “In Nineveh, by the decree of the king and his nobles: No man, animal, herd, or flock is to taste anything. They are not to eat or drink water. 
JON.3.8	But both man and animal must be covered with sackcloth; and every one is to call on God earnestly 
JON.3.9	Who knows, God may turn [in compassion] and relent and withdraw His burning anger (judgment) so that we will not perish.”
JON.3.10	When God saw their deeds, that they turned from their wicked way, then God [had compassion and] relented concerning the disaster which He had declared that He would bring upon them. And He did not do it.
JON.4.1	But it greatly displeased Jonah and he became angry. 
JON.4.2	He prayed to the L
JON.4.3	Therefore now, O L
JON.4.4	Then the L
JON.4.5	Then Jonah went out of the city and sat east of it. There he made himself a shelter and sat under its shade so that he could see what would happen in the city. 
JON.4.6	So the L
JON.4.7	But God prepared a worm when morning dawned the next day, and it attacked the plant and it withered. 
JON.4.8	When the sun came up God prepared a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on Jonah’s head so that he fainted and he wished to die, and said, “It is better for me to die than to live.”
JON.4.9	Then God said to Jonah, “Do you have a good reason to be angry about [the loss of] the plant?” And he said, “I have a [very] good reason to be angry, angry enough to die!” 
JON.4.10	Then the L
JON.4.11	Should I not have compassion on Nineveh, the great city in which there are more than 120,000 [innocent] persons, who do not know

MIC.1.4	And the valleys shall be split
MIC.1.4	Like wax before the fire,
MIC.1.4	Like waters poured down a steep place.
MIC.1.5	All this is because of the rebellion 
MIC.1.5	And for the sins of the house of Israel (the Northern Kingdom).
MIC.1.5	What is the rebellion 
MIC.1.5	Is it not [the abandonment of God in order to worship the idols of] Samaria?
MIC.1.5	What are the high places [of idolatry] in Judah (the Southern Kingdom)?
MIC.1.5	Are they not Jerusalem [the capital and center of corruption]?
MIC.1.6	Therefore I [the L

MIC.1.7	All her idols shall be broken in pieces,
MIC.1.7	All her earnings [from her idolatry] shall be burned with fire,
MIC.1.7	And all her images I shall make desolate;
MIC.1.7	For from the earnings of a prostitute she collected them,
MIC.1.7	And to the earnings of a prostitute they shall return.
MIC.1.8	Because of this I [Micah] must lament (mourn over with expressions of grief) and wail,
MIC.1.8	I must go barefoot and naked [without outer garments as if robbed];
MIC.1.8	I must wail like the jackals

MIC.1.12	Because a catastrophe has come down from the L
MIC.1.12	To the gate of Jerusalem.
MIC.1.13	Harness the chariot to the team of horses [to escape the invasion],
MIC.1.13	O inhabitant of Lachish—
MIC.1.13	She was the beginning of sin
MIC.1.13	To the Daughter of Zion (Jerusalem)—
MIC.1.13	Because in you were found
MIC.1.13	The rebellious acts of Israel.
MIC.1.14	Therefore you will give parting gifts
MIC.1.14	On behalf of Moresheth-gath (Micah’s home);
MIC.1.14	The houses of Achzib (Place of Deceit) will become a deception
MIC.1.14	To the kings of Israel.
MIC.1.15	Moreover, I will bring on you
MIC.1.15	The one who takes possession,
MIC.1.15	O inhabitant of Mareshah (Prominent Place).
MIC.1.15	The glory (nobility) of Israel will enter Adullam [seeking refuge].
MIC.1.16	Make yourself bald [in mourning]—shave off your hair
MIC.1.16	For the children of your delight;
MIC.1.16	Remain as bald as the eagle,
MIC.1.16	For your children will be taken from you into exile.
MIC.2.1	Woe (judgment is coming) to those who devise wickedness
MIC.2.1	And plot evil on their beds!
MIC.2.1	When morning comes, they practice evil
MIC.2.1	Because it is in the power of their hands.
MIC.2.2	They covet fields and seize them,
MIC.2.2	And houses, and take them away.
MIC.2.2	They oppress 
MIC.2.2	A man and his inheritance.
MIC.2.3	Therefore, thus says the L
MIC.2.3	“Behold, I am planning against this family a disaster (exile)
MIC.2.3	[Like a noose] from which you cannot remove your necks;
MIC.2.3	Nor will you be able to walk haughtily 
MIC.2.3	For it will be an evil time [of subjugation to the invaders].
MIC.2.4	On that day they shall take up a [taunting, deriding] parable against you
MIC.2.4	And wail with a doleful 
MIC.2.4	‘We are completely destroyed!
MIC.2.4	God exchanges the inheritance of my people;
MIC.2.4	How He removes it from me!
MIC.2.4	He divides our fields to the rebellious [our captors].’
MIC.2.5	Therefore, you will have no one stretching a measuring line [dividing the common land]
MIC.2.5	For you by lot in the assembly of the L
MIC.2.6	‘Do not speak out,’ so they speak out.
MIC.2.6	Reproaches will not be turned back.
MIC.2.7	Is it being said, O house of Jacob:
MIC.2.7	‘Is the Spirit of the L
MIC.2.7	Or are these [prophesied judgments] His doings?’
MIC.2.7	Do not My words do good
MIC.2.7	To the one walking uprightly?
MIC.2.8	But lately My people have stood up as an enemy [and have made Me their antagonist].
MIC.2.8	You strip the ornaments off the garment
MIC.2.8	Of those unsuspecting passers-by,
MIC.2.8	Like those returned from war.
MIC.2.9	You evict the women (widows) of My people,
MIC.2.9	Each one from her pleasant house;
MIC.2.9	From her [young, fatherless] children you take away My splendor 
MIC.2.10	Arise and depart [because the captivity is inevitable],
MIC.2.10	For this [land] is not the place of rest
MIC.2.10	Because of the defilement that brings destruction,
MIC.2.10	A painful 
MIC.2.11	If a man walking in a false spirit [spouting deception]
MIC.2.11	Should lie and say,
MIC.2.11	‘I will prophesy to you [O Israel] of wine and liquor (greed, sensual pleasure),’
MIC.2.11	He would be the acceptable spokesman of this people.
MIC.2.12	“I shall most certainly assemble all of you, O Jacob;
MIC.2.12	I shall surely gather the remnant of Israel.
MIC.2.12	I shall bring them together like sheep in the fold [multiplying the nation];
MIC.2.12	Like a flock in the midst of its pasture.
MIC.2.12	The place will swarm with many people 
MIC.2.13	The 
MIC.2.13	They will break out, pass through the gate and go out;
MIC.2.13	So their King goes on before them,
MIC.2.13	The L
MIC.3.1	And I said,
MIC.3.1	“Hear now, heads of Jacob
MIC.3.1	And rulers of the house of Israel.
MIC.3.1	Is it not for you to know 
MIC.3.2	You who hate good and love evil,
MIC.3.2	Who tear the skin off my people
MIC.3.2	And their flesh from their bones;
MIC.3.3	You who eat the flesh of my people,
MIC.3.3	Strip off their skin from them,
MIC.3.3	Break their bones
MIC.3.3	And chop them in pieces as for the pot,
MIC.3.3	Like meat in a kettle.”
MIC.3.4	Then they will cry to the L
MIC.3.4	But He will not answer them;
MIC.3.4	Instead, He will even hide His face from them at that time [withholding His mercy]
MIC.3.4	Because they have practiced 
MIC.3.5	Thus says the L
MIC.3.5	When they have 
MIC.3.5	They call out, “Peace,”
MIC.3.5	But against the one who gives them nothing to eat,
MIC.3.5	They declare a holy war.
MIC.3.6	Therefore 
MIC.3.6	And darkness (cataclysm) for you—without foresight.
MIC.3.6	The sun shall go down on the [false] prophets,
MIC.3.6	And the day shall become dark 
MIC.3.7	The seers shall be ashamed
MIC.3.7	And the diviners discredited 
MIC.3.7	Indeed, they shall all cover their mouths [in shame]
MIC.3.7	Because there is no answer from God.
MIC.3.8	But in fact, I am filled with power,
MIC.3.8	With the Spirit of the L
MIC.3.8	And with justice and might,
MIC.3.8	To declare to Jacob his transgression
MIC.3.8	And to Israel his sin.
MIC.3.9	Now hear this, you heads of the house of Jacob
MIC.3.9	And rulers of the house of Israel,
MIC.3.9	Who hate 
MIC.3.9	And twist everything that is straight,
MIC.3.10	Who build Zion with blood [and extortion and murder]
MIC.3.10	And Jerusalem with violent injustice.
MIC.3.11	Her leaders pronounce judgment for a bribe,
MIC.3.11	Her priests teach for a fee,
MIC.3.11	And her prophets foretell for money;
MIC.3.11	Yet they lean on the L
MIC.3.11	“Is not the L
MIC.3.11	No tragedy 
MIC.3.12	Therefore, on account of you
MIC.3.12	Jerusalem shall become 
MIC.3.12	And the mountain of the house [of the L
MIC.4.1	But it shall come about in the last days
MIC.4.1	That the mountain of the house of the L
MIC.4.1	Shall be established as the highest 
MIC.4.1	It shall be above the hills,
MIC.4.1	And peoples shall flow [like a river] to it.
MIC.4.2	And many nations shall come and say,
MIC.4.2	“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the L
MIC.4.2	To the house of the God of Jacob,
MIC.4.2	That He may teach us about His ways
MIC.4.2	And that we may walk in His paths.”
MIC.4.2	For the law shall go forward from Zion,
MIC.4.2	And the word of the L
MIC.4.3	And He will judge between many peoples
MIC.4.3	And render decisions for strong and distant nations.
MIC.4.3	Then they shall hammer their swords into plowshares
MIC.4.3	And their spears into pruning hooks [so that the implements of war may become the tools of agriculture];
MIC.4.3	Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
MIC.4.3	Nor shall they ever again train for war.
MIC.4.4	Each of them shall sit [in security and peace] under his vine
MIC.4.4	And under his fig tree,
MIC.4.4	With no one to make them afraid,
MIC.4.4	For the mouth of the [omnipotent] L
MIC.4.5	For all the peoples [now] walk
MIC.4.5	Each in the name of his god [in a transient relationship],
MIC.4.5	As for us, we shall walk [securely]
MIC.4.5	In the name of the L
MIC.4.6	“In that day,” says the L
MIC.4.6	“I shall assemble the lame,
MIC.4.6	And gather the outcasts [from foreign captivity],
MIC.4.6	Even those whom I have caused pain.
MIC.4.7	I shall make the lame a [godly] remnant
MIC.4.7	And the outcasts a strong nation;
MIC.4.7	And the L
MIC.4.7	From this time on and forever.
MIC.4.8	As for you [Jerusalem], tower of the flock [of Israel],
MIC.4.8	Hill 
MIC.4.8	To you the former dominion shall come,
MIC.4.8	The kingdom of the Daughter of Jerusalem [when the Messiah reigns in Jerusalem, and the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled].
MIC.4.9	“Now, why do you cry out loudly?
MIC.4.9	Is there no king among you?
MIC.4.9	Has your counselor perished?
MIC.4.9	For agony has gripped you like a woman in childbirth.
MIC.4.10	Writhe in pain and labor to give birth,
MIC.4.10	O Daughter of Zion,
MIC.4.10	Like a woman in childbirth;
MIC.4.10	For now you shall go out of the city,
MIC.4.10	Live in the field,
MIC.4.10	And go to Babylon.
MIC.4.10	There you will be rescued;
MIC.4.10	There the L
MIC.4.10	From the hand of your enemies.
MIC.4.11	Now many [conquering] nations are assembled against you,
MIC.4.11	Who say, ‘Let her be profaned [through Gentile presence and the temple’s destruction],
MIC.4.11	And let our eyes gaze on 
MIC.4.12	But they (Gentile nations) do not know the thoughts of the L
MIC.4.12	Nor do they understand His purpose 
MIC.4.12	For He has gathered them (Gentiles) like sheaves to the threshing floor [for destruction].
MIC.4.13	Arise and thresh, O Daughter of Zion!
MIC.4.13	For I will make your horn iron
MIC.4.13	And I will make your hoofs bronze;
MIC.4.13	That you may beat many peoples in pieces [trampling down your enemies],
MIC.4.13	That you may devote to the L
MIC.4.13	And their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.
MIC.5.1	“Now gather yourself in troops, O daughter of troops;
MIC.5.1	A state of siege has been placed against us.
MIC.5.1	They shall strike the ruler of Israel on the cheek with a rod (scepter).
MIC.5.2	But as for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,
MIC.5.2	Too little to be among the clans of Judah;
MIC.5.2	From you One shall come forth for Me [who is] to be Ruler in Israel,
MIC.5.2	His goings forth (appearances) are from long ago,
MIC.5.2	From 
MIC.5.3	Therefore, He will give them up until the time
MIC.5.3	When she who is in labor has given birth to a child.
MIC.5.3	Then what is left of His kinsmen
MIC.5.3	Shall return to the children of Israel.
MIC.5.4	And He shall stand and shepherd 
MIC.5.4	In the strength of the L
MIC.5.4	In the majesty of the name of the L

MIC.5.4	Because at that time He shall be great [extending His authority]
MIC.5.4	[Even] to the ends of the earth.
MIC.5.5	This One [the Messiah] shall be our peace.
MIC.5.5	And tramples on our citadels 
MIC.5.5	Then shall we raise against him
MIC.5.5	Seven shepherds and eight princes [an overpowering force] among men.
MIC.5.6	They shall devastate the land of Assyria with the sword and
MIC.5.6	The land of Nimrod within her [own] gates.
MIC.5.6	And He (the Messiah) shall rescue us from the Assyrian (all enemy nations)
MIC.5.6	When he attacks our land
MIC.5.6	And when he tramples our territory.
MIC.5.7	Then the remnant of Jacob
MIC.5.7	Shall be among many peoples
MIC.5.7	Like dew from the L
MIC.5.7	Like showers on the grass [a source of blessing]
MIC.5.7	Which [come suddenly and] do not wait for man
MIC.5.7	Nor delay for the sons of men.
MIC.5.8	The remnant of Jacob

MIC.5.8	Which, if he passes through,

MIC.5.8	And there is no one to rescue.
MIC.5.9	Your hand will be lifted up against your adversaries,

MIC.5.14	I will root out your Asherim (symbols of the goddess Asherah) from among you
MIC.5.14	And destroy your cities [which are the centers of pagan worship].
MIC.5.15	And in anger and wrath I shall execute vengeance
MIC.5.15	On the nations which have not obeyed [such vengeance as they have not known before].”

MIC.6.1	And let the hills [as witnesses] hear your voice.
MIC.6.2	Hear, O mountains, the indictment of the L

MIC.6.3	O My people, what have I done to you [since you have turned away from Me]?
MIC.6.3	And how have I wearied you? Answer Me.
MIC.6.4	For I brought you up from the land of Egypt
MIC.6.4	And ransomed you from the house of slavery,
MIC.6.4	And I sent before you Moses [to lead you], Aaron [the high priest], and Miriam [the prophetess].
MIC.6.5	My people, remember now
MIC.6.5	What Balak king of Moab devised [with his evil plan against Israel]
MIC.6.5	And what Balaam the son of Beor answered him [turning the curse into blessing for Israel],
MIC.6.5	[Remember what the L

MIC.6.6	Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings,
MIC.6.6	With yearling calves?
MIC.6.7	Will the L

MIC.6.8	And to walk humbly with your God [setting aside any overblown sense of importance or self-righteousness]?
MIC.6.9	The voice of the L
MIC.6.9	And it is sound wisdom to heed [solemnly] 
MIC.6.9	“Hear, O tribe [the rod of punishment]. Who has appointed its time?
MIC.6.10	Are there not still treasures gained by wickedness
MIC.6.10	In the house of the wicked,
MIC.6.10	And a short (inaccurate) measure [for grain] 
MIC.6.11	Can I [be guiltless and] justify deceptive scales
MIC.6.11	And a bag of dishonest weights?
MIC.6.12	For the rich men of the city are full of violence [of every kind];
MIC.6.12	Her inhabitants speak lies
MIC.6.12	And their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.
MIC.6.13	So also I will make you sick, striking you down,

MIC.6.14	And what you do save I shall give to the sword.
MIC.6.15	You shall sow but you shall not reap;
MIC.6.15	You shall tread olives, but shall not anoint yourself with oil,
MIC.6.15	And [you will extract juice from] the grapes, but you shall not drink the wine.
MIC.6.16	For [you have kept] the statutes of Omri [the idolatrous king],
MIC.6.16	And all the works of the [wicked] house (dynasty) of Ahab;
MIC.6.16	And you walk in their counsels 
MIC.6.16	Therefore, I shall hand you over for destruction 
MIC.6.16	And your [city’s] inhabitants for ridicule,
MIC.6.16	And you shall bear the rebuke 
MIC.7.1	Woe is me (judgment is coming)! For I am
MIC.7.1	Like one who gathers the summer fruits, like one who gleans the vintage grapes.
MIC.7.1	There is not a cluster of grapes to eat,
MIC.7.1	No first-ripe fig which my appetite craves.
MIC.7.2	The godly person [who is faithful and loyal to God] has perished from the earth,
MIC.7.2	And there is no upright

MIC.7.2	Each hunts the other with a net.
MIC.7.3	Concerning evil, both of their hands pursue it and do it diligently 
MIC.7.3	The prince asks, also the judge, for a bribe,
MIC.7.3	And a great man speaks the [evil] desire of his soul.
MIC.7.3	So they twist the course of justice between them.
MIC.7.4	The best of them is [injurious] like a briar;
MIC.7.4	The most upright is [prickly] like a thorn hedge.
MIC.7.4	The day of your watchmen [that is, the time predicted by the prophets]

MIC.7.5	Do not trust in a neighbor [because of the moral corruption in the land];
MIC.7.5	Do not have confidence in a friend.
MIC.7.5	Guard the doors of your mouth
MIC.7.5	From her who lies in your bosom.
MIC.7.6	For the son dishonors the father 
MIC.7.6	The daughter rises up [in hostility] against her mother,
MIC.7.6	The daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law—
MIC.7.6	A man’s enemies are the men (members) of his own household.
MIC.7.7	But as for me, I will look expectantly for the L
MIC.7.7	I will wait [with confident expectation] for the God of my salvation.
MIC.7.7	My God will hear me.

MIC.7.8	Though I fall, I will rise;
MIC.7.8	Though I sit in the darkness [of distress], the L
MIC.7.9	I will bear the indignation 
MIC.7.9	Because I have sinned against Him,
MIC.7.9	Until He pleads my case and executes judgment for me.
MIC.7.9	He will bring me out to the light,
MIC.7.9	And I will behold His [amazing] righteousness

NAM.2.11	Where is the den of the lions (Assyria)
NAM.2.11	And the feeding place of the young lions,
NAM.2.11	Where the lion, lioness, and lion’s cub prowled
NAM.2.11	With nothing to fear?
NAM.2.12	The lion [of Assyria] tore enough for his cubs (Assyrian citizens),
NAM.2.12	Killed [enough prey] for his lionesses,
NAM.2.12	And filled his lairs with prey
NAM.2.12	And his dens with torn flesh.
NAM.2.13	“Behold, I am against you [Nineveh],” declares the L
NAM.3.1	Woe (judgment is coming) to the city of blood [guilty of murder and mayhem], completely full of lies and pillage;
NAM.3.1	Her prey never departs [alive].
NAM.3.2	The noise of the [cracking of the] whip,
NAM.3.2	The noise of the rattling of the wheel,
NAM.3.2	Galloping horses
NAM.3.2	And rumbling 
NAM.3.3	Horsemen charging,
NAM.3.3	Swords flashing, spears gleaming,
NAM.3.3	Many slain, a mass of corpses,
NAM.3.3	No end of corpses—
NAM.3.3	The horsemen stumble over the corpses!
NAM.3.4	All because of the many acts of prostitution of [Nineveh] the prostitute,
NAM.3.4	The charming

NAM.3.4	And families by her sorceries.
NAM.3.5	“Behold, I am against you,” declares the L

NAM.3.8	With water surrounding her,
NAM.3.8	Whose defense was the sea (the Nile),
NAM.3.8	Whose wall 
NAM.3.9	Ethiopia was her strength,

NAM.3.11	You will be hidden.
NAM.3.11	You too [Nineveh] will search [in vain] for a refuge from the enemy.
NAM.3.12	All your fortresses are [nothing but] fig trees with ripe figs—
NAM.3.12	When shaken they fall into the mouth of the eater.
NAM.3.13	Behold, your people are [as weak and helpless as] women in your midst!
NAM.3.13	The gates of your land are opened wide to your enemies;
NAM.3.13	Fire consumes the bars across your gates.

HAB.1.3	And cause me to look on wickedness?
HAB.1.3	For destruction and violence are before me;
HAB.1.3	Strife continues and contention arises.
HAB.1.4	Therefore, the law is ineffective 
HAB.1.4	And justice is never upheld,

HAB.1.6	For behold, I am raising up the 
HAB.1.6	That fierce and impetuous nation
HAB.1.6	Who march throughout the earth
HAB.1.6	To take possession of dwelling places that do not belong to them.

HAB.1.10	They make fun of kings
HAB.1.10	And rulers are a laughing matter to them.
HAB.1.10	They ridicule every stronghold

HAB.1.14	Why do You make men like the fish of the sea,
HAB.1.14	Like reptiles 
HAB.1.15	And drag them away with a net,
HAB.1.15	And gather them together in their fishing net;
HAB.1.15	So they rejoice and are glad.

ZEP.3.10	My worshipers, [the descendants of] My dispersed ones,

ZEP.3.11	On that day you [Israel] will feel no shame
ZEP.3.11	Because of all your acts
ZEP.3.11	By which you have rebelled 
ZEP.3.11	Then I will remove from among you
ZEP.3.11	Your rejoicing ones who delight in their pride;
ZEP.3.11	And you will never again behave arrogantly
ZEP.3.11	On My holy mountain [Mount Zion].
ZEP.3.12	But I will leave among you
ZEP.3.12	A humble and lowly people,
ZEP.3.12	And they will take refuge 
ZEP.3.13	The remnant of Israel will do no wrong
ZEP.3.13	Nor speak lies,
ZEP.3.13	Nor will a deceitful tongue
ZEP.3.13	Be found in their mouths;
ZEP.3.13	For they will eat and lie down
ZEP.3.13	With no one to make them tremble 
ZEP.3.14	Shout for joy, O Daughter of Zion!
ZEP.3.14	Shout 
ZEP.3.14	Rejoice, be in high spirits 
ZEP.3.14	O Daughter of Jerusalem [in that day]!
ZEP.3.15	The L

ZEP.3.15	The King of Israel, even the L
ZEP.3.15	You will no longer fear disaster.
ZEP.3.16	In that day it will be said to Jerusalem:
ZEP.3.16	“Do not be afraid, O Zion;
ZEP.3.16	Do not let your hands fall limp.
ZEP.3.17	The L
ZEP.3.17	A Warrior who saves.
ZEP.3.17	He will rejoice over you with joy;
ZEP.3.17	He will be quiet in His love [making no mention of your past sins],
ZEP.3.17	He will rejoice over you with shouts of joy.
ZEP.3.18	I will gather those [Israelites in captivity] who grieve about the appointed feasts—
ZEP.3.18	They came from you, [O Zion];
ZEP.3.18	On whom the reproach [of exile] is a burden.
ZEP.3.19	Behold, at that time I am going to deal
ZEP.3.19	With all your oppressors;
ZEP.3.19	I will save the lame
ZEP.3.19	And gather the scattered,
ZEP.3.19	And I will turn their shame into praise and renown
ZEP.3.19	In every land [where they have suffered].
ZEP.3.20	At that time I will bring you in,
ZEP.3.20	Yes, at the time I gather you together;
ZEP.3.20	For I will make you a name and a praise
ZEP.3.20	Among all the peoples of the earth
ZEP.3.20	When I restore your fortunes [and freedom] before your eyes,”
ZEP.3.20	Says the L
HAG.1.1	In the second year of

HAG.1.10	Therefore, because of you [that is, your sin and disobedience] the heavens withhold the dew and the earth withholds its produce. 
HAG.1.11	I called for a drought on the land and the hill country, on the grain, on the new wine, on the oil, on what the ground produces, on men, on cattle, and on all the labor of your hands.”
HAG.1.12	Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people [who had returned from exile], listened carefully 
HAG.1.13	Then Haggai, the L
HAG.1.14	So the L
HAG.1.15	on the 
HAG.2.1	On the twenty-first day of the 
HAG.2.2	“Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying, 
HAG.2.3	‘Who is left among you who saw this

HAG.2.5	‘As for the promise which I made with you when you came out of Egypt, My Spirit stands [firm and immovable]

HAG.2.10	On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month (Dec 18, 520

HAG.2.12	If a man carries meat that is holy [because it has been offered in sacrifice to God] in the fold of his garment, and he touches bread, or cooked food, or wine, or oil, or any [kind of] food with this fold, does what he touches become holy [dedicated exclusively to God’s service]?’ ” And the priests answered, “No!” [
HAG.2.13	Then Haggai said, “If one who is [ceremonially] unclean because of [contact with] a corpse touches any of these [articles of food], will it be unclean?” And the priests answered, “It will be unclean.” [Ceremonial uncleanness, like sin, is infectious.] 
HAG.2.14	Then Haggai answered, “ ‘So is this people. And so is this nation before Me,’ declares the L

ZEC.1.20	Then the L

ZEC.2.3	And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him, 
ZEC.2.4	and he said to the second angel, “Run, speak to that young man, saying, ‘Jerusalem will be inhabited [like villages] without walls [spreading out into the open country] because of the great number of people and livestock in it.

ZEC.11.2	For the inaccessible forest [on the steep mountainside] has come down.
ZEC.11.3	There is a sound of the shepherds’ wail,

ZEC.11.9	So I said, “I will not pasture you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be destroyed, let it be destroyed; and let the survivors devour one another’s flesh.” 
ZEC.11.10	I took my staff, Favor, and broke it in pieces, breaking the covenant which I had made with all the peoples. 
ZEC.11.11	So the covenant was broken on that day, and thus the most wretched of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the L

MAT.1.10	Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, and Amon the father of Josiah. 
MAT.1.11	Josiah became the father of Jeconiah [also called Coniah and Jehoiachin] and his brothers, at the time of the deportation (exile) to Babylon.
MAT.1.12	After the deportation to Babylon: Jeconiah became the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel. 
MAT.1.13	Zerubbabel was the father of Abihud, Abihud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor. 
MAT.1.14	Azor was the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud. 
MAT.1.15	Eliud was the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob. 
MAT.1.16	Jacob was the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, by 
MAT.1.17	So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen; from David to the Babylonian deportation (exile), fourteen generations; and from the Babylonian deportation to the Messiah, fourteen generations.
MAT.1.18	Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: when His mother Mary had been 
MAT.1.19	And Joseph her [promised] husband, being a just 
MAT.1.20	But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, descendant of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the Child who has been

MAT.2.8	Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “Go and search carefully for the Child; and when you have found Him, report to me, so that I too may come and worship Him.” 
MAT.2.9	After hearing the king, they went their way; and behold, the star, which they had seen in the east, went on before them [continually leading the way] until it came and stood over 
MAT.2.10	When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. 
MAT.2.11	And after entering the house, they saw the Child with Mary His mother; and they fell down and worshiped Him. Then, after opening their treasure chests, they presented to Him gifts [fit for a king, gifts] of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. 
MAT.2.12	And having been warned [by God] in a dream not to go back to Herod, the magi left for their own country by another way.
MAT.2.13	Now when they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Get up! Take the Child and His mother and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod intends to search for the Child in order to destroy Him.”
MAT.2.14	So Joseph got up and took the Child and His mother while it was still night, and left for Egypt. 
MAT.2.15	He remained there until the death of Herod. 
MAT.2.16	Then Herod, when he realized that he had been tricked by the magi, was extremely angry, and he sent [soldiers] and put to death all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that area who were two years old and under, according to the date which he had learned from the magi. 
MAT.2.17	Then what had been spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled:

MAT.2.19	But when

MAT.2.21	Then Joseph got up, and took the Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel.

MAT.3.15	But Jesus replied to him,

MAT.4.3	And the tempter came and said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.” 
MAT.4.4	But Jesus replied, 
MAT.4.5	Then the devil took Him into the holy city [Jerusalem] and placed Him on the pinnacle (highest point) of the temple. 
MAT.4.6	And he said [mockingly] to Him, “If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down; for it is written,

MAT.4.9	and he said to Him, “All these things I will give You, if You fall down and worship me.” 
MAT.4.10	Then Jesus said to him, 
MAT.4.11	Then the devil left Him; and angels came and ministered to Him [bringing Him food and serving Him].
MAT.4.12	Now when Jesus heard that John [the Baptist] had been arrested 
MAT.4.13	And leaving Nazareth, He went and settled in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the country of Zebulun and Naphtali.

MAT.4.17	From that time Jesus began to preach and say,

MAT.4.19	And He said to them, 
MAT.4.20	Immediately they left their nets and followed Him [becoming His disciples, believing and trusting in Him and following His example]. 
MAT.4.21	And going on [further] from there He noticed two other brothers, James the 
MAT.4.22	Immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him [becoming His disciples, believing and trusting in Him and following His example].
MAT.4.23	And He went throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news (gospel) of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people [demonstrating and revealing that He was indeed the promised Messiah].
MAT.4.24	So the news about Him spread throughout all Syria; and they brought to Him all who were sick, those suffering with various diseases and pains, those under the power of demons, and epileptics, paralytics; and He healed them.

MAT.8.1	When Jesus came down from the mountain, large crowds 
MAT.8.2	And a leper came up to Him and bowed down before Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You are able to make me clean (well).” 
MAT.8.3	Jesus reached out His hand and touched him, saying,

MAT.8.10	When Jesus heard this, He was amazed and said to those who were following Him,

MAT.8.12	 [the descendants of Abraham who will not recognize Me as Messiah]

MAT.8.15	He touched her hand and the fever left her; and she got up and served Him. 
MAT.8.16	When evening came, they brought to Him many who were under the power of demons; and He cast out the

MAT.8.18	Now when Jesus saw a crowd around Him, He gave orders to cast off for the other side 
MAT.8.19	Then [on His way to board the boat] a scribe [who was a respected and authoritative interpreter of the Law] came and said to Him, “Master, I will accompany You [as Your student] wherever You go.” 
MAT.8.20	Jesus replied to him, 
MAT.8.21	Another of the 
MAT.8.22	But Jesus said to him, 
MAT.8.23	When He got into the boat, His disciples followed Him. 
MAT.8.24	And suddenly a violent storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was being covered by the waves; but Jesus was sleeping. 
MAT.8.25	And the disciples went and woke Him, saying, “Lord, save us, we are going to die!” 
MAT.8.26	He said to them, 
MAT.8.27	The men wondered in amazement, saying, “What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?”
MAT.8.28	When He arrived at the other side in the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming out of the tombs met Him. 
MAT.8.29	And they screamed out, “
MAT.8.30	Some distance from them a large herd of pigs was grazing. 
MAT.8.31	The demons 
MAT.8.32	And He said to them, 
MAT.8.33	The herdsmen ran away, and went to the city and reported everything, including what had happened to the men under the power of demons. 
MAT.8.34	And the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and as soon as they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
MAT.9.1	And Jesus, getting into a boat, crossed over 
MAT.9.2	They brought to Him a man who was paralyzed, lying on a stretcher. Seeing their [active] faith [springing from confidence in Him], Jesus said to the paralytic, 
MAT.9.3	And some of the scribes said to themselves, “This 
MAT.9.4	But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, 
MAT.9.5	 [Both are possible for God; both are impossible for man.] 
MAT.9.6	—then He said to the paralytic, 
MAT.9.7	And he got up and went home [healed and forgiven]. 
MAT.9.8	When the crowds saw this, they were awestruck, and glorified God 
MAT.9.9	As Jesus went on from there, He saw a man named Matthew (Levi) sitting in the tax collector’s booth; and He said to him, 
MAT.9.10	Then as Jesus was reclining 
MAT.9.11	When the Pharisees saw this, they asked His disciples, “Why does your Master eat with tax collectors and sinners?” 
MAT.9.12	But when Jesus heard 
MAT.9.13	 [Scripture] 
MAT.9.14	Then the disciples of John [the Baptist] came to Jesus, asking, “Why do we and the Pharisees often fast [as a religious exercise], but Your disciples do not fast?” 
MAT.9.15	And Jesus replied to them, 
MAT.9.17	 [that have lost their elasticity]; 
MAT.9.18	While He was saying these things to them, a ruler (synagogue official) entered [the house] and kneeled down 
MAT.9.19	Jesus got up and 
MAT.9.20	Then a woman who had suffered from a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind Him and touched the [tassel] fringe of His outer robe; 
MAT.9.21	for she had been saying to herself, “If I only touch His outer robe, I will be healed.” 
MAT.9.22	But Jesus turning and seeing her said, 
MAT.9.23	When Jesus came to the ruler’s house, and saw the flute players [who were professional, hired mourners] and the [grieving] crowd making an uproar, 
MAT.9.24	He said, 
MAT.9.25	But when the crowd had been sent outside, Jesus went in and took her by the hand, and the girl got up. 
MAT.9.26	And the news about this spread throughout all that district.
MAT.9.27	As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed Him, screaming loudly, “Have mercy 
MAT.9.28	When He went into the house, the blind men came up to Him, and Jesus said to them, 
MAT.9.29	Then He touched their eyes, saying, 
MAT.9.30	And their eyes were opened. And Jesus 
MAT.9.31	But they went out and spread the news about Him throughout that whole district.
MAT.9.32	While they were going away, a mute, demon-possessed man was brought to Jesus. 
MAT.9.33	And when the demon was driven out [by Jesus], the mute man spoke; and the crowds wondered in amazement, saying, “Never before has anything like this [miracle] been seen in Israel.” 
MAT.9.34	But the Pharisees were saying, “He casts out the demons by [the power of] the ruler of demons.”
MAT.9.35	Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages [in Galilee], teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news (gospel) of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness [His words and His works reflecting His Messiahship].
MAT.9.36	When He saw the crowds, He was moved with compassion 
MAT.9.37	Then He said to His disciples, 
MAT.10.1	Jesus summoned His twelve disciples and gave them authority 
MAT.10.2	Now these are the names of the twelve 
MAT.10.3	Philip and Bartholomew (Nathanael); Thomas and Matthew (Levi) the tax collector; 
MAT.10.4	Simon the Cananaean (Zealot), and Judas Iscariot, the one who betrayed Him.
MAT.10.5	Jesus sent out these twelve, instructing them: 
MAT.10.9	 [even] 
MAT.10.11	 [who welcomes you and your message], 
MAT.10.12	 [that is, ‘Peace be to this house’]. 
MAT.10.13	 [the family living in] 
MAT.10.14	 [of it] 
MAT.10.15	 [since it rejected the Messiah’s messenger].
MAT.10.17	 [whose nature is to act in opposition to God], 
MAT.10.19	 [very] 
MAT.10.22	 [your association with] 
MAT.10.25	 [will they speak evil of] 
MAT.10.27	 [to many people]. 
MAT.10.30	 [for the Father is sovereign and has complete knowledge]. 
MAT.10.36	[own] 
MAT.10.38	 [expressing a willingness to endure whatever may come] 
MAT.10.39	 [in this world] 
MAT.10.42	 [these who are humble in rank or influence] 
MAT.11.1	When Jesus had finished giving instructions to His twelve disciples, He went on from there to teach and to preach in their [Galilean] cities.
MAT.11.2	Now when 
MAT.11.3	and asked Him, “Are You the Expected One (the Messiah), or should we look for someone else [who will be the promised One]?” 
MAT.11.4	Jesus answered, 
MAT.11.5	[their] 
MAT.11.6	 [joyful, favored by God] 
MAT.11.7	As these men were going away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: 
MAT.11.8	 [entirely unsuited for the harsh desert]? 
MAT.11.9	 [really] 
MAT.11.10	 [by the prophet Malachi],
MAT.11.12	 [as a precious prize]. 
MAT.11.13	. 
MAT.11.14	 [the fulfillment of] 
MAT.11.17	 [playing wedding], 
MAT.11.18	 [with others], 
MAT.11.19	 [with others], 
MAT.11.20	Then He began to denounce [the people in] the cities in which most of His miracles were done, because they did not repent [and change their hearts and lives]. 
MAT.11.21	 [cities of the Gentiles], 
MAT.11.22	 [the pagan cities of] 
MAT.11.23	 [for your apathy and unresponsiveness]? 
MAT.11.25	At that time Jesus said, 
MAT.11.27	 [deliberately] 
MAT.11.29	 [following Me as My disciple], 
MAT.11.30	 [to bear] 
MAT.12.1	At that particular time Jesus went through the grainfields on the 
MAT.12.2	But when the Pharisees saw this, they said to Him, “Look! Your disciples are doing what 
MAT.12.3	He said to them, 
MAT.12.5	 [the sanctity of] 
MAT.12.7	[for those in distress], 
MAT.12.9	Leaving there, He went into their synagogue. 
MAT.12.10	A man 
MAT.12.11	But He said to them, 
MAT.12.13	Then He said to the man, 
MAT.12.14	But the Pharisees went out and conspired against Him, 
MAT.12.15	Being aware of this, Jesus left there. Many followed Him, and He healed all of them [who were sick], 
MAT.12.16	and warned them not to tell [publicly] who He was. 
MAT.12.17	 to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:
MAT.12.18	“B
MAT.12.18	M
MAT.12.18	I 
MAT.12.18	A
MAT.12.19	H
MAT.12.19	N
MAT.12.20	A 
MAT.12.20	A
MAT.12.20	U
MAT.12.21	A
MAT.12.22	Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to Jesus, and He healed him, so that the mute man both spoke and saw. 
MAT.12.23	All the people wondered in amazement, and said, “Could this be the Son of David (the Messiah)?” 
MAT.12.24	But the Pharisees heard it and said, “This man 
MAT.12.25	Knowing their thoughts Jesus said to them, 
MAT.12.26	 [that is, his demons], 
MAT.12.27	 [the help of] 
MAT.12.28	 [before you expected it]. 
MAT.12.32	 [by attributing the miracles done by Me to Satan] 
MAT.12.35	 [inner] 
MAT.12.37	 [reflecting your spiritual condition] 
MAT.12.38	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Him, “Teacher, we want to see a sign (attesting miracle) from You [proving that You are what You claim to be].” 
MAT.12.39	But He replied and said to them, 
MAT.12.41	 [as witnesses] 
MAT.12.42	 [as a witness] 
MAT.12.46	While He was still talking to the crowds, it happened that His mother and brothers stood outside, asking to speak to Him. 
MAT.12.47	Someone said to Him, “Look! Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside asking to speak to You.” 
MAT.12.48	But Jesus replied to the one who told Him, 
MAT.12.49	And stretching out His hand toward His disciples [and all His other followers], He said, 
MAT.12.50	 [by believing in Me, and following Me] 
MAT.13.1	That same day Jesus went out of the house and was sitting beside the sea [of Galilee]. 
MAT.13.2	But such large crowds gathered around Him that He got into a boat and sat there [positioning Himself as a teacher], while the whole crowd stood on the shore.
MAT.13.3	He told them many things in 
MAT.13.4	 [between the fields], 
MAT.13.8	 [as was sown], 
MAT.13.9	 [to hear], 
MAT.13.10	Then the disciples came to Him and asked, “Why do You speak to the crowds in parables?” 
MAT.13.11	Jesus replied to them, 
MAT.13.12	 [spiritual wisdom because he is receptive to God’s word], 
MAT.13.13	 [having the power of] 
MAT.13.17	 [who were honorable and in right standing with God] 
MAT.13.19	 [regarding salvation] 
MAT.13.21	 [substantial] 
MAT.13.22	 [the superficial pleasures and delight] 
MAT.13.23	 [as much as was sown], 
MAT.13.24	Jesus gave them another parable [to consider], saying, 
MAT.13.25	 [resembling wheat] 
MAT.13.31	He gave them another parable [to consider], saying, 
MAT.13.32	 [planted in the region] 
MAT.13.33	He told them another parable, 
MAT.13.34	All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables, and He said nothing to them without [using] a parable. 
MAT.13.35	 to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet:
MAT.13.35	“I 
MAT.13.35	I 
MAT.13.36	Then He left the crowds and went into the house. And His disciples came to Him saying, “Explain [clearly] to us the parable of the weeds in the field.” 
MAT.13.37	He answered, 
MAT.13.38	 [as for] 
MAT.13.41	 [those things by which people are led into sin], 
MAT.13.42	 [over sorrow and pain] 
MAT.13.43	 [those who seek the will of God] 
MAT.13.50	 [over sorrow and pain] 
MAT.13.52	He said to them, 
MAT.13.53	When Jesus had finished these parables, He left there. 
MAT.13.54	And after coming to [Nazareth] His hometown, He 
MAT.13.55	Is not this the carpenter’s son? Is not His mother called Mary? And are not His brothers, James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? 
MAT.13.56	And His sisters, are they not [living here] among us? Where then did this Man get all this [wisdom and power]?” 
MAT.13.57	And they took offense at Him [refusing to believe in Him]. But Jesus said to them, 
MAT.13.58	And He did not do many miracles there [in Nazareth] because of their unbelief.
MAT.14.1	At that time Herod [Antipas], the tetrarch [who governed a portion of Palestine including Galilee and Perea], heard the reports about Jesus, 
MAT.14.2	and said to his attendants, “This is John the Baptist; he has been raised from the dead, and that is why the miraculous powers are at work in him.”
MAT.14.3	For Herod had John arrested and bound him and put him in prison [at the fortress of Machaerus, east of the Jordan, to keep him away] because of 
MAT.14.4	for John had said to him, “It is not lawful (morally right) for you to have her [living with you as your wife].” 
MAT.14.5	Although Herod wished to have him put to death, he feared the people, for they regarded John as a prophet.
MAT.14.6	But when Herod’s birthday came, [his niece Salome], the daughter of Herodias danced [immodestly] before them and pleased 
MAT.14.7	so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. 
MAT.14.8	She, being coached by her mother [Herodias], said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.” 
MAT.14.9	The king was distressed, but because of his oaths, and because of his dinner guests, he ordered it to be given her. 
MAT.14.10	He sent and had John beheaded in the prison. 
MAT.14.11	His head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother [Herodias]. 
MAT.14.12	And John’s disciples came and took away the body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.
MAT.14.13	When Jesus heard 
MAT.14.14	When He went ashore, He saw a large crowd, and felt [profound] compassion for them and healed their sick.
MAT.14.15	When evening came, the disciples came to Him and said, “This is an isolated place and the hour is already late; send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.” 
MAT.14.16	But Jesus said to them, 
MAT.14.17	They replied, “We have nothing here except five loaves and two fish.” 
MAT.14.18	He said, 
MAT.14.19	Then He ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and He took the five loaves and the two fish and, looking up toward heaven, He blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples 
MAT.14.20	and they all ate and were satisfied. They picked up twelve full baskets of the leftover broken pieces. 
MAT.14.21	There were about 5,000 men who ate, besides women and children.
MAT.14.22	Immediately He directed the disciples to get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side [of the Sea of Galilee], while He sent the crowds away. 
MAT.14.23	After He had dismissed the crowds, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. When it was evening, He was there alone. 
MAT.14.24	But the boat [by this time] was already a 
MAT.14.25	And in the fourth watch of the night (3:00-6:00 a.m.) Jesus came to them, walking on the sea. 
MAT.14.26	When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, “It is a ghost!” And they cried out in fear. 
MAT.14.27	But immediately He spoke to them, saying, 
MAT.14.28	Peter replied to Him, “Lord, if it is [really] You, command me to come to You on the water.” 
MAT.14.29	He said, 
MAT.14.30	But when he saw [the effects of] the wind, he was frightened, and he began to sink, and he cried out, “Lord, save me!” 
MAT.14.31	Immediately Jesus extended His hand and caught him, saying to him, 
MAT.14.32	And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased. 
MAT.14.33	Then those in the boat worshiped Him [with awe-inspired reverence], saying, “Truly You are the Son of God!”
MAT.14.34	When they had crossed over [the sea], they went ashore at Gennesaret. 
MAT.14.35	And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent 
MAT.14.36	and they begged Him to let them merely touch the fringe of His robe; and all who touched it were perfectly restored.
MAT.15.1	Then some Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem came to Jesus and said, 
MAT.15.2	“Why do Your disciples violate the 
MAT.15.3	He replied to them, 
MAT.15.4	 [through Moses], 
MAT.15.5	 [money or resource that] 
MAT.15.6	 [by helping them with their need].’ 
MAT.15.10	After Jesus called the crowd to Him, He said, 
MAT.15.12	Then the disciples came and said to Jesus, “Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard 
MAT.15.13	He answered, 
MAT.15.15	Peter asked Him, “Explain this parable [about what defiles a person] to us.” 
MAT.15.16	And He said, 
MAT.15.18	 [word] 
MAT.15.20	 [ceremonially] 
MAT.15.21	After leaving there, Jesus withdrew to the district of 
MAT.15.22	And a 
MAT.15.23	But He did not say a word in answer to her. And His disciples came and asked Him [repeatedly], “Send her away, because she keeps shouting out after us.” 
MAT.15.24	He answered, 
MAT.15.25	But she came and 
MAT.15.26	And He replied, 
MAT.15.27	She said, “Yes, Lord; but even the pet dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their [young] masters’ table.” 
MAT.15.28	Then Jesus answered her, 
MAT.15.29	Jesus went on from there and passed along by [the eastern shore of] the Sea of Galilee. Then He went up on the hillside and was sitting there. 
MAT.15.30	And great crowds came to Him, bringing with them the lame, crippled, blind, mute, and many others, and they put them down at His feet; and He healed them. 
MAT.15.31	So the crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled restored, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they praised 
MAT.15.32	Then Jesus called His disciples to Him, and said, 
MAT.15.33	The disciples said to Him, “Where are we to get enough bread in this isolated place to feed so large a crowd?” 
MAT.15.34	And Jesus asked them, 
MAT.15.35	He directed the crowd to sit down on the ground, 
MAT.15.36	and He took the seven loaves and the fish; and when He had given thanks, He broke them and started giving them to the disciples, and the disciples [gave them] to the people. 
MAT.15.37	And they all ate and were satisfied, and they gathered up seven full baskets of the broken pieces that were left over. 
MAT.15.38	[Among] those who ate were 4,000 men, not counting women and children.
MAT.15.39	Then Jesus sent the crowds away, got into the boat and went to the district of 
MAT.16.1	Now the Pharisees and Sadducees came up, and testing Jesus [to get something to use against Him], they asked Him to show them a sign from heaven [which would support His divine authority]. 
MAT.16.2	But He replied to them, 
MAT.16.4	 [morally] 
MAT.16.5	When the disciples reached the other side 
MAT.16.6	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.16.7	They began to discuss this among themselves, saying, “
MAT.16.8	But Jesus, aware of this, said, 
MAT.16.12	Then they understood that He did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the [false] teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
MAT.16.13	Now when Jesus went into the 
MAT.16.14	And they answered, “Some say John the Baptist; others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah, or [just] one of the prophets.” 
MAT.16.15	He said to them, 
MAT.16.16	Simon Peter replied, “You are the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed), the Son of the living God.” 
MAT.16.17	Then Jesus answered him, 
MAT.16.18	 [by preventing the resurrection of the Christ]. 
MAT.16.19	 [forbid, declare to be improper and unlawful] 
MAT.16.20	Then He gave the disciples strict orders to tell no one that He was the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed).
MAT.16.22	Peter took Him aside [to speak to Him privately] and began to reprimand Him, saying, “May God forbid it! This will never happen to You.” 
MAT.16.23	But Jesus turned and said to Peter, 
MAT.16.24	Then Jesus said to His disciples, 
MAT.16.25	 [in this world] 
MAT.16.26	 [wealth, fame, success], 
MAT.17.1	Six days later Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John the brother of James, and led them up on a high mountain by themselves. 
MAT.17.2	And His appearance changed dramatically in their presence; and His face shone [with heavenly glory, clear and bright] like the sun, and His clothing became as white as light. 
MAT.17.3	And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus. 
MAT.17.4	Then Peter began to speak and said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good 
MAT.17.5	While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and 
MAT.17.6	When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces and were terrified. 
MAT.17.7	But Jesus came and touched them and said, 
MAT.17.8	And when they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone.
MAT.17.9	And as they were going down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, 
MAT.17.10	The disciples asked Him, “Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?” 
MAT.17.11	He answered and said, 
MAT.17.13	Then the disciples understood that He had spoken to them about John the Baptist.
MAT.17.14	When they approached the crowd, a man came up to Jesus, kneeling before Him and saying, 
MAT.17.15	“Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is a lunatic (moonstruck) and suffers terribly; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water. 
MAT.17.16	And I brought him to Your disciples, and they were not able to heal him.” 
MAT.17.17	And Jesus answered, 
MAT.17.18	Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him, and the boy was healed at once.
MAT.17.19	Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and asked, “Why could we not drive it out?” 
MAT.17.20	He answered, 
MAT.17.22	When they were gathering together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, 
MAT.17.23	 [from death to life] 
MAT.17.24	When they arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the 
MAT.17.25	Peter answered, “Yes.” And when he came home, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, 
MAT.17.26	When Peter said, “From strangers,” Jesus said to him, 
MAT.17.27	 [to pay the temple tax] 
MAT.18.1	At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” 
MAT.18.2	He called a little child and set him before them, 
MAT.18.3	and said, 
MAT.18.6	 [by leading him away from My teaching], 
MAT.18.9	 [that is, remove yourself from the source of temptation]; 
MAT.18.17	 [refusing to listen and obey], 
MAT.18.18	 [forbid, declare to be improper and unlawful] 
MAT.18.20	 [meeting together as My followers], 
MAT.18.21	Then Peter came to Him and asked, “Lord, how many times will my brother sin against me and I forgive him 
MAT.18.22	Jesus answered him, 
MAT.18.27	 [canceling] 
MAT.18.31	 [with clarity and in detail] 
MAT.18.32	 [great] 
MAT.18.33	 [who owed you little by comparison], 
MAT.18.35	 [every one of] 
MAT.19.1	Now when Jesus had finished saying these things, He left Galilee and went into the part of Judea that is beyond the Jordan; 
MAT.19.2	and large crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.
MAT.19.3	And Pharisees came to Jesus, testing Him and asking, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for just any reason?” 
MAT.19.4	He replied, 
MAT.19.7	The Pharisees said to Him, “Why then did Moses command us to 
MAT.19.8	He said to them, 
MAT.19.10	The disciples said to Jesus, “If the relationship of a man with his wife is like this, it is better not to marry.” 
MAT.19.11	But He said to them, 
MAT.19.12	 [making them incapable of consummating a marriage]; 
MAT.19.13	Then children were brought to Jesus so that He might place His hands on them [for a blessing] and pray; but the disciples reprimanded them. 
MAT.19.14	But He said, 
MAT.19.15	After placing His hands on them [for a blessing], He went on from there.
MAT.19.16	And someone came to Him and said, “Teacher, what [essentially] good thing shall I do to obtain eternal life [that is, eternal salvation in the Messiah’s kingdom]?” 
MAT.19.17	Jesus answered, 
MAT.19.18	He said to Jesus, “Which commandments?” And Jesus answered, 
MAT.19.19	 [that is, unselfishly seek the best or higher good for others]. 
MAT.19.20	The young man said to Him, “I have kept all these things [from my youth]; what do I still lack?” 
MAT.19.21	Jesus answered him, 
MAT.19.22	But when the young man heard this, he left grieving 
MAT.19.23	Jesus said to His disciples, 
MAT.19.24	 [who places his faith in wealth and status] 
MAT.19.25	When the disciples heard this, they were completely 
MAT.19.26	But Jesus looked at them and said, 
MAT.19.27	Then Peter answered Him, saying, “Look, we have given up everything and followed You [becoming Your disciples and accepting You as Teacher and Lord]; what then will there be for us?” 
MAT.19.28	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.19.30	 [in this world] 
MAT.20.9	 [a day’s wage]. 
MAT.20.10	 [to be hired] 
MAT.20.12	 [only] 
MAT.20.14	 [hired] 
MAT.20.16	 [in this world] 
MAT.20.17	As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve [disciples] aside, and along the way He said to them, 
MAT.20.18	 [judicially] 
MAT.20.19	 [to life] 
MAT.20.20	Then [Salome] the 
MAT.20.21	And He said to her, 
MAT.20.22	But Jesus replied, 
MAT.20.23	He said to them, 
MAT.20.24	And when the [other] ten heard this, they were resentful 
MAT.20.25	But Jesus called them to Himself and said, 
MAT.20.27	 [willing and humble] 
MAT.20.28	 [paying the price to set them free from the penalty of sin].”
MAT.20.29	As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Him. 
MAT.20.30	And two blind men were sitting by the road, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David (Messiah)!” 
MAT.20.31	The crowd sternly told them to be quiet, but they cried out all the more, “Lord, Son of David (Messiah) have mercy on us!” 
MAT.20.32	Jesus stopped and called them, and asked, 
MAT.20.33	They answered Him, “Lord, 
MAT.20.34	Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes; and immediately they regained their sight and followed Him [as His disciples].
MAT.21.1	When they approached Jerusalem and had reached Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples [ahead], 
MAT.21.2	saying to them, 
MAT.21.3	 [with you].” 
MAT.21.4	This happened so that what was spoken by the prophet would be fulfilled, saying:
MAT.21.5	“T
MAT.21.5	‘B
MAT.21.5	G
MAT.21.5	E
MAT.21.6	Then the disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them, 
MAT.21.7	and they brought the donkey and 
MAT.21.8	Most of the crowd spread their coats on the road [as before a king], while others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them on the road. 
MAT.21.9	The crowds that went ahead of Him, and those that followed Him, were shouting [in praise and adoration],
MAT.21.9	“
MAT.21.9	B
MAT.21.9	Hosanna in the highest [heaven]!”
MAT.21.10	When He entered Jerusalem, all the city was trembling [with excitement], saying, “Who is this?” 
MAT.21.11	And the crowds were saying, “This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth in Galilee.”
MAT.21.12	And Jesus entered the temple [grounds] and drove out [with force] all who were buying and selling [birds and animals for sacrifice] in the temple 
MAT.21.13	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.21.14	And the blind and the lame came to Him in [the porticoes and courts of] the temple 
MAT.21.15	But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful 
MAT.21.16	and they said to Him, “Do You hear what these 
MAT.21.17	Then He left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there.
MAT.21.18	Now early in the morning, as Jesus was coming back to the city, He was hungry. 
MAT.21.19	Seeing a lone fig tree at the roadside, He went to it and found nothing but leaves on it; and He said to it, 
MAT.21.20	When the disciples saw it, they were astonished and asked, “How is it that the fig tree has withered away all at once?” 
MAT.21.21	Jesus replied to them, 
MAT.21.23	When He entered the temple 
MAT.21.24	Jesus replied to them, 
MAT.21.25	 [that is, ordained by God] 
MAT.21.26	But if we say, ‘From men,’ we are afraid of the [response of the] crowd; for they all regard John as a prophet.” 
MAT.21.27	So they answered Jesus, “We do not know.” And He said to them, 
MAT.21.31	 The chief priests and elders replied, “The first one.” Jesus said to them, 
MAT.21.32	 [walking] 
MAT.21.34	 [share of the] 
MAT.21.38	 [man] 
MAT.21.41	They said to Him, “He will put those despicable men to a miserable end, and rent out the vineyard to other tenants [of good character] who will pay him the proceeds at the 
MAT.21.42	Jesus asked them, 
MAT.21.45	When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they understood that He was talking about them. 
MAT.21.46	And although they were trying to arrest Him, they feared the people, because they regarded Jesus as a prophet.
MAT.22.1	Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying, 
MAT.22.3	 [previously] 
MAT.22.5	 [they disregarded the invitation, treating it with contempt] 
MAT.22.6	 [of the invited guests] 
MAT.22.7	 [when he heard this], 
MAT.22.8	 [feast] 
MAT.22.10	 [sitting at the banquet table].
MAT.22.12	 [that were provided for you]?’ 
MAT.22.13	 [over sorrow and pain] 
MAT.22.15	Then the Pharisees went and conspired together plotting how to trap Him by [distorting] what He said. 
MAT.22.16	They sent their disciples to Him, along with the 
MAT.22.17	Tell us then, what do You think? Is it permissible [according to Jewish law and tradition] to pay a 
MAT.22.18	But Jesus, aware of their malice, asked, 
MAT.22.19	 And they brought Him a denarius [a day’s wage]. 
MAT.22.20	And Jesus said to them, 
MAT.22.21	They said, “[
MAT.22.22	When they heard this, they were caught off guard, and they left Him and went away.
MAT.22.23	On that day some Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection [of the dead], came to Him and asked Him a question, 
MAT.22.24	saying, “Teacher, Moses said, ‘I
MAT.22.25	Now there were seven brothers among us; the first married and died, and having no children left his wife to his brother. 
MAT.22.26	The second also [died childless], and the third, down to the seventh. 
MAT.22.27	Last of all, the woman died. 
MAT.22.28	So in the resurrection, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had 
MAT.22.29	But Jesus replied to them, 
MAT.22.30	 [who do not marry nor produce children]. 
MAT.22.31	 [in the Scripture] 
MAT.22.33	When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at His teaching.
MAT.22.34	Now when the Pharisees heard that He had silenced (muzzled) the Sadducees, they gathered together. 
MAT.22.35	One of them, a lawyer [an expert in Mosaic Law], asked Jesus 
MAT.22.36	“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” 
MAT.22.37	And Jesus replied to him, 
MAT.22.39	 [that is, unselfishly seek the best or higher good for others].’ 
MAT.22.40	 [writings of the] 
MAT.22.41	Now while the Pharisees were [still] gathered together, Jesus asked them a question: 
MAT.22.42	 [Pharisees] 
MAT.22.43	Jesus asked them, 
MAT.22.46	No one was able to say a word to Him in answer, nor from that day on did anyone dare to question Him again.
MAT.23.1	Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples, 
MAT.23.2	saying: 
MAT.23.3	 [things], 
MAT.23.4	 [that are hard to bear] 
MAT.23.5	 [to make them more conspicuous] 
MAT.23.6	 [those on the platform near the scrolls of the Law, facing the congregation],

MAT.23.39	 [ministering to you publicly] 
MAT.24.1	Jesus left the temple 
MAT.24.2	And He said to them, 
MAT.24.3	While Jesus was seated on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, and said, “Tell us, when will this [destruction of the temple] take place, and what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end (completion, consummation) of the age?”
MAT.24.4	Jesus answered, 
MAT.24.5	 [misusing it, and appropriating the strength of the name which belongs to Me], 
MAT.24.6	 [of the age]. 
MAT.24.8	 [of the intolerable anguish and the time of unprecedented trouble].

MAT.24.35	 [as now known] 
MAT.24.38	 [very] 
MAT.24.39	 [unexpected judgment].

MAT.24.41	 [for judgment] 
MAT.24.44	 [who follow Me] 
MAT.24.46	 [faithful] 
MAT.24.48	 [he will not return for a long while],’ 
MAT.24.51	 [over sorrow and pain] 
MAT.25.2	 [thoughtless, silly, and careless], 
MAT.25.3	 [extra]

MAT.25.13	 [be prepared and ready], 
MAT.25.16	 [made a profit and] 
MAT.25.17	 [made a profit and] 
MAT.25.20	 [made a profit and] 
MAT.25.25	 [to lose the talent],

MAT.25.36	 [with help and ministering care]; 
MAT.25.43	 [with help and ministering care].’ 
MAT.25.44	 [in their turn] 
MAT.25.45	 [my followers], 
MAT.25.46	 [unbelieving people] 
MAT.26.1	When Jesus had finished this 
MAT.26.3	Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the courtyard of the [elegant home of the Jewish] high priest, whose name was 
MAT.26.4	and plotted together to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill Him. 
MAT.26.5	But they said, “It must not be during the festival (Passover), otherwise there might be a riot among the people.”
MAT.26.6	Now when Jesus was [back] in Bethany, at the home of 
MAT.26.7	a 
MAT.26.8	But when the 
MAT.26.9	For this 
MAT.26.10	But Jesus, aware [of the malice] of this [remark], said to them, 
MAT.26.13	 [of salvation] 
MAT.26.14	Then one of the twelve [disciples], who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests 
MAT.26.15	and said, “What are you willing to give me if I hand Jesus over to you?” And they weighed out 
MAT.26.16	And from that moment Judas 
MAT.26.17	Now on the first day of 
MAT.26.18	He said, 
MAT.26.19	[Accordingly] the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.
MAT.26.20	When evening came, Jesus was reclining 
MAT.26.21	And as they were eating, He said, 
MAT.26.22	Being deeply grieved 
MAT.26.23	Jesus answered, 
MAT.26.24	 [to the cross], 
MAT.26.25	And Judas, the betrayer, said, “Surely it is not I, Rabbi?” Jesus said to him, 
MAT.26.26	Now as they were eating Jesus took bread, and after 
MAT.26.27	And when He had taken a cup and 
MAT.26.28	 [new and better] 
MAT.26.30	After singing a 
MAT.26.31	Then Jesus said to them, 
MAT.26.32	 [to life], 
MAT.26.33	Peter replied to Him, “Though they all fall away because of You [and doubt and disown You], I will never fall away!” 
MAT.26.34	Jesus said to him, 
MAT.26.35	Peter said to Jesus, “Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You!” And all the disciples said the same thing.
MAT.26.36	Then Jesus came with them to a place called 
MAT.26.37	And taking with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee [James and John], He began to be grieved and greatly distressed. 
MAT.26.38	Then He said to them, 
MAT.26.39	And after going a little farther, He fell face down and prayed, saying, 
MAT.26.40	And He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, 
MAT.26.42	He went away a second time and prayed, saying, 
MAT.26.43	Again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. 
MAT.26.44	So, leaving them again, He went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words once more. 
MAT.26.45	Then He returned to the disciples and said to them, 
MAT.26.47	As Jesus was still speaking, Judas [Iscariot], one of the twelve [disciples], came up accompanied by a large crowd with swords and clubs, [who came as representatives] from the chief priests and elders of the people. 
MAT.26.48	Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “Whomever I kiss, He is the one; seize Him.” 
MAT.26.49	Immediately Judas went to Jesus and said, “Greetings (rejoice), Rabbi!” And he 
MAT.26.50	Jesus said to Judas, 
MAT.26.51	And 
MAT.26.52	Then Jesus said to him, 
MAT.26.55	At that moment Jesus said to the crowds, 
MAT.26.56	 Then all the disciples deserted Him and fled.
MAT.26.57	Those who had seized Jesus led Him away to 
MAT.26.58	But Peter followed Him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the [elegant home of the Jewish] high priest, and went inside, and sat with the 
MAT.26.59	Now the chief priests and the whole Council (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court) tried to get false witnesses to testify against Jesus, so that they might [have a reason to] put Him to death. 
MAT.26.60	They found none, even though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward, 
MAT.26.61	and testified, “This man said, ‘
MAT.26.62	The high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Have You no answer to give? What is it that these men are testifying against You?” 
MAT.26.63	But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest said to Him, “I call on You to swear a binding oath by the living God, that you tell us whether You are the Christ, the Son of God.” 
MAT.26.64	Jesus said to him, 
MAT.26.65	Then the high priest tore his 
MAT.26.66	What do you think?” They answered, “
MAT.26.67	Then they spat in His face and struck Him with their fists; and some slapped Him, 
MAT.26.68	saying, “
MAT.26.69	Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant-girl came up to him and said, “You too were with Jesus the Galilean.” 
MAT.26.70	But he denied it before them all, saying, “I do not know what you are talking about.” 
MAT.26.71	And when he had gone out to the gateway, another 
MAT.26.72	And again he denied it with an oath, “I do not know the man.” 
MAT.26.73	After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, “Surely you are one of them too; for even your [Galilean] accent gives you away.” 
MAT.26.74	Then he began to curse [that is, to invoke God’s judgment on himself] and swear [an oath], “I do not know the man!” And at that moment a rooster crowed. 
MAT.26.75	And Peter remembered the [prophetic] words of Jesus, when He had said, 
MAT.27.1	When it was morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court) conferred together against Jesus, [plotting how] to put Him to death [since under Roman rule they had no power to execute anyone]; 
MAT.27.2	so they bound Him, and led Him away and handed Him over to Pilate the governor [of Judea, who had the authority to condemn prisoners to death].
MAT.27.3	When Judas, His betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was gripped with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, 
MAT.27.4	saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.” They replied, “What is that to us? See to that yourself!” 
MAT.27.5	And throwing the pieces of silver into the temple sanctuary, he left; and went away and 
MAT.27.6	The chief priests, picking up the pieces of silver, said, “It is not lawful to put these in the treasury [of the temple], because it is the price of blood.” 
MAT.27.7	So after consultation they used the money to buy the Potter’s Field as a burial place for strangers. 
MAT.27.8	Therefore that piece of ground has been called the Field of Blood to this day. 
MAT.27.9	Then the words spoken by Jeremiah the prophet were fulfilled: “A
MAT.27.10	 P
MAT.27.11	Now Jesus stood before [Pilate] the governor, and the governor asked Him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” [In affirmation] Jesus said to him, 
MAT.27.12	But when the charges were brought against Him by the chief priests and elders, He did not answer. 
MAT.27.13	Then Pilate said to Him, “Do You not hear how many things they are testifying against You?” 
MAT.27.14	But Jesus did not reply to him, not even to a single accusation, so that the governor was greatly astonished.
MAT.27.15	Now at the feast [of the Passover] the governor was in the habit of setting free any one prisoner whom the people chose. 
MAT.27.16	And at that time they were holding a notorious prisoner [guilty of insurrection and murder], called Barabbas. 
MAT.27.17	So when they had assembled [for this purpose], Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to set free for you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?” 
MAT.27.18	For Pilate knew that it was because of jealousy that the chief priests and elders had handed Jesus over to him.
MAT.27.19	While he was seated on the judgment seat, his wife sent him 
MAT.27.20	But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to put Jesus to death. 
MAT.27.21	The governor said to them, “Which of the two do you wish me to set free for you?” And they said, “Barabbas.” 
MAT.27.22	Pilate said to them, “Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?” They all replied, “Let Him be crucified!” 
MAT.27.23	And he said, “Why, what has He done that is evil?” But they continued shouting all the louder, “Let Him be crucified!”
MAT.27.24	So when Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but rather that a riot was breaking out, he took water and washed his hands [to ceremonially cleanse himself of guilt] in the presence of the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this [righteous] Man’s blood; see 
MAT.27.25	And all the people answered, “Let [the responsibility for] His blood be on us and on our children!” 
MAT.27.26	So he set Barabbas free for them; but after having Jesus severely whipped (scourged), he handed Him over to be crucified.
MAT.27.27	Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into 
MAT.27.28	They stripped him and put a scarlet 
MAT.27.29	And after twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and put a reed in His right hand [as a scepter]. Kneeling before Him, they ridiculed Him, saying, “Hail (rejoice), King of the Jews!” 
MAT.27.30	They spat on Him, and took the reed and struck Him 
MAT.27.31	After they finished ridiculing Him, they stripped Him of the 
MAT.27.32	Now as they were coming out, they found a man of 
MAT.27.33	And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means 
MAT.27.34	they offered Him wine mixed with gall (myrrh, a bitter-tasting narcotic) to drink; but after tasting it, He refused to drink it.
MAT.27.35	And when they had crucified Him, they divided His clothes among them by casting 
MAT.27.36	Then sitting down there, they 
MAT.27.37	And above His head they put the accusation against Him which read, “
MAT.27.38	At the same time two robbers were crucified with Jesus, one on the right and one on the left. 
MAT.27.39	Those who passed by were hurling abuse at Him 
MAT.27.40	and they said [tauntingly], “You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save Yourself [from death]! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross.” 
MAT.27.41	In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes and elders, mocked Him, saying, 
MAT.27.42	“He saved others [from death]; He cannot save Himself. He is the King of Israel; let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in Him 
MAT.27.43	H
MAT.27.44	The robbers who had been crucified with Him also began to insult Him in the same way.
MAT.27.45	Now from the sixth hour (noon) there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour (3:00 p.m.). 
MAT.27.46	About the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud [agonized] voice, 
MAT.27.47	When some of the bystanders there heard it, they 
MAT.27.48	Immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, soaked it with sour wine and put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink. 
MAT.27.49	But the rest said, “Let us see whether Elijah will come to save Him [from death].” 
MAT.27.50	And Jesus cried out again with a loud [agonized] voice, and gave up His spirit [voluntarily, sovereignly dismissing and releasing His spirit from His body in submission to His Father’s plan]. 
MAT.27.51	And [at once] the veil [of the Holy of Holies] of the temple was 
MAT.27.52	The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints (God’s people) who had fallen asleep [in death] were raised [to life]; 
MAT.27.53	and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection, they entered the holy city (Jerusalem) and appeared to many people. 
MAT.27.54	Now the centurion, and those who were with him keeping guard over Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that were happening, they were terribly frightened 
MAT.27.55	There were also many women there looking on from a distance, who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him. 
MAT.27.56	Among them was 
MAT.27.57	When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus. 
MAT.27.58	He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus [so that he might bury Him], and Pilate ordered that it be given 
MAT.27.59	And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth (burial wrapping), 
MAT.27.60	and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock; and he rolled a large stone over the entrance of the tomb and went away. 
MAT.27.61	And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other 
MAT.27.62	The next day, that is, 
MAT.27.63	and said, “Sir, we have remembered that when He was still alive that deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise [from the dead].’ 
MAT.27.64	Therefore, give orders to have the tomb made secure 
MAT.27.65	Pilate said to them, “You have a guard [of soldiers]; go [with them], make the tomb as secure as you know how.” 
MAT.27.66	So they went and 
MAT.28.1	Now after the Sabbath, near dawn of the first 
MAT.28.2	And a great earthquake had occurred, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone [from the opening of the tomb], and sat on it. 
MAT.28.3	The angel’s appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were as white as snow. 
MAT.28.4	The guards shook, paralyzed with fear [at the sight] of him and became like dead men [pale and immobile]. 
MAT.28.5	But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid; for I know that you are looking for Jesus who has been crucified. 
MAT.28.6	He is not here, for He has risen, just as He said [He would]. Come! See the place where He was lying. 
MAT.28.7	Then go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead; and behold, He is going ahead of you into Galilee [as He promised]. There you will see Him; behold, I have told you.”
MAT.28.8	So the women left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy, and ran to tell [the good news to] the disciples. 
MAT.28.9	And 
MAT.28.10	Then Jesus said to them, 
MAT.28.11	While they were on their way, some of the [Roman] guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. 
MAT.28.12	And when the chief priests had gathered with the elders and had consulted together [to develop a plan of deception], they gave a sufficient sum of money [as a bribe] to the soldiers, 
MAT.28.13	and said, “You say this, ‘His disciples came at night and stole Him while we were sleeping.’ 
MAT.28.14	And if the governor (Pilate) hears about it, we will calm him down and keep you out of trouble.” 
MAT.28.15	So they took the money [they were paid for lying] and did as they were instructed; and this [fabricated] story was widely spread among the Jews, and is to the present day.
MAT.28.16	Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had designated. 
MAT.28.17	And when they saw Him, they worshiped 
MAT.28.18	Jesus came up and said to them, 
MAT.28.19	 [help the people to learn of Me, believe in Me, and obey My words], 
MAT.28.20	 [remaining with you perpetually—regardless of circumstance, and on every occasion], 
MRK.1.1	The beginning of the [facts regarding the] good news of

MRK.1.7	And he was preaching, saying, “After me comes He who is mightier [more powerful, more noble] than I, and I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the straps of His sandals [even as His slave]. 
MRK.1.8	As for me, I baptized you [who came to me] with water [only]; but He will baptize you [who truly repent] 
MRK.1.9	In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. 
MRK.1.10	Immediately coming up out of the water, he (John) saw the heavens torn open, and the 
MRK.1.11	and a 
MRK.1.12	Immediately the [Holy] Spirit forced Him out into the wilderness. 
MRK.1.13	He was in the wilderness forty days being tempted [to do evil] by Satan; and He was with the wild animals, and the angels ministered 
MRK.1.14	Now after John [the Baptist] was arrested 
MRK.1.15	and saying, 
MRK.1.16	As Jesus was walking by the shore of the 
MRK.1.17	And Jesus said to them, 
MRK.1.18	Immediately they left their nets and followed Him [becoming His disciples, believing and trusting in Him and following His example]. 
MRK.1.19	Going on a little farther, He saw James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John, who were also in the boat mending 
MRK.1.20	Immediately Jesus called to them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired workers, and went away to follow Him [becoming His disciples, believing and trusting in Him and following His example].
MRK.1.21	They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath Jesus went into the synagogue and 
MRK.1.22	They were completely amazed at His teaching; because He was teaching them as one having [God-given] authority, and not as the scribes. 
MRK.1.23	Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit; and he cried out [terribly from the depths of his throat], 
MRK.1.24	saying, “
MRK.1.25	Jesus rebuked him, saying, 
MRK.1.26	The unclean spirit threw the man into convulsions, and screeching with a loud voice, came out of him. 
MRK.1.27	They were all so amazed that they debated 
MRK.1.28	Immediately the news about Him spread everywhere throughout the district surrounding Galilee.
MRK.1.29	And immediately they left the synagogue and went into the house of Simon [Peter] and Andrew, accompanied by James and John. 
MRK.1.30	Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever; and immediately they told Him about her. 
MRK.1.31	Jesus went to her, and taking her by the hand, raised her up; and the fever left her, and she 
MRK.1.32	Now when evening came, after the sun had set [and the Sabbath Day had ended, in a steady stream] they were bringing to Him all who were sick and those who were under the power of demons, 
MRK.1.33	until the whole city had gathered together at the door. 
MRK.1.34	And Jesus healed many who were suffering with various diseases; and He drove out many demons, but would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew Him [recognizing Him as the Son of God].
MRK.1.35	Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left [the house], and went out to a secluded place, and was praying there. 
MRK.1.36	Simon [Peter] and his companions searched [everywhere, looking anxiously] for Him, 
MRK.1.37	and they found Him and said, “Everybody is looking for You!” 
MRK.1.38	He replied, 
MRK.1.39	So He went throughout Galilee, preaching [the gospel] in their synagogues and casting out demons.
MRK.1.40	And a leper came to Him, begging Him and falling on his knees before Him, saying, “If You are willing, You are able to make me 
MRK.1.41	Moved with compassion [for his suffering], Jesus reached out with His hand and touched him, and said to him, 
MRK.1.42	The leprosy left him immediately and he was cleansed [completely healed and restored to health]. 
MRK.1.43	And Jesus [deeply moved] admonished him sternly and sent him away immediately, 
MRK.1.44	saying to him, 
MRK.1.45	But he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the news [of his healing], to such an extent that Jesus could no longer openly enter a city [where He was known], but stayed out in the unpopulated places; yet people were still coming to Him from everywhere.
MRK.2.1	Jesus returned to Capernaum, and a few days later the news went out that He was at home. 
MRK.2.2	So many people gathered together that there was no longer room [for them], not even near the door; and Jesus was discussing with them the word [of God]. 
MRK.2.3	Then they came, bringing to Him a paralyzed man, who was being carried by four men. 
MRK.2.4	When they were unable to get to Him because of the crowd, they 
MRK.2.5	When Jesus saw their [active] faith [springing from confidence in Him], He said to the paralyzed man, 
MRK.2.6	But some of the 
MRK.2.7	“Why does this man talk that way? He is blaspheming; who can forgive sins [remove guilt, nullify sin’s penalty, and assign righteousness] except God alone?” 
MRK.2.8	Immediately Jesus, being fully aware [of their hostility] 
MRK.2.10	—He said to the paralyzed man, 
MRK.2.12	And he got up and immediately picked up the mat and went out before them all, so that they all were astonished and they glorified 
MRK.2.13	Jesus went out again along the [Galilean] seashore; and all the people were coming to Him, and He was teaching them.
MRK.2.14	As He was passing by, He saw Levi (Matthew) the son of Alphaeus sitting in the 
MRK.2.15	And it happened that Jesus was 
MRK.2.16	When the scribes [belonging to the sect] of the 
MRK.2.17	When Jesus heard this, He said to them, 
MRK.2.18	Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting [as a ritual]; and they came and asked Jesus, “Why are John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fasting, but Your disciples are not doing so?” 
MRK.2.19	Jesus answered, 
MRK.2.20	 [forcefully] 
MRK.2.22	 [fermenting] 
MRK.2.23	One Sabbath He was walking along [with His disciples] through the grainfields, and as they went along, His disciples began picking the heads of grain. 
MRK.2.24	The Pharisees said to Him, “Look, why are they doing what 
MRK.2.25	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.2.27	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.2.28	 [and He has authority over it].”
MRK.3.1	Again Jesus went into a synagogue; and a man was there whose hand was 
MRK.3.2	The Pharisees were watching Jesus 
MRK.3.3	He said to the man whose hand was withered, 
MRK.3.4	He asked them, 
MRK.3.5	After looking around at them with anger, grieved at the hardness 
MRK.3.6	Then the Pharisees went out and immediately 
MRK.3.7	Jesus withdrew to the sea with His disciples; and a large crowd from Galilee followed Him; and 
MRK.3.8	and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and [from the region] beyond the Jordan, and around Tyre and Sidon; a vast number of people came to Him because they were hearing about all [the things] that He was doing. 
MRK.3.9	And He told His disciples to have a small boat stand ready for Him because of the many people, so that they would not crowd Him; 
MRK.3.10	for He had healed many, and as a result all who had diseases pressed around Him to touch Him. 
MRK.3.11	Whenever the unclean spirits saw Him, they fell down before Him and screamed out, “You are the Son of God!” 
MRK.3.12	Jesus sternly warned them [again and again] not to tell who He was.
MRK.3.13	He went up on the hillside and called those whom He Himself wanted 
MRK.3.14	And He appointed 
MRK.3.15	and to have authority 
MRK.3.16	He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom He gave the name Peter), 
MRK.3.17	and James, the son of 
MRK.3.18	and [He also appointed] Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew (Nathanael), and Matthew (Levi the tax collector), and Thomas, and 
MRK.3.19	and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Him.
MRK.3.20	Then He came to a 
MRK.3.21	When His own family heard this they went to take custody of Him; for they were saying, “He is out of His mind.” 
MRK.3.22	The scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, “He is possessed by 
MRK.3.23	So He called them to Himself and spoke to them in 
MRK.3.24	 [split into factions and rebelling] 
MRK.3.29	 [by attributing the miracles done by Me to Satan] 
MRK.3.30	[Jesus said this] because the scribes and Pharisees were [attributing His miracles to Satan by] saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”
MRK.3.31	Then His mother and His brothers arrived, and standing outside they sent 
MRK.3.32	A crowd was sitting around Him, and they said to Him, “Look! Your mother and Your brothers are outside asking for You.” 
MRK.3.33	And He replied, 
MRK.3.34	Looking at those who were sitting in a circle around Him, He said, 
MRK.3.35	 [by believing in Me, and following Me], 
MRK.4.1	Again Jesus began to teach beside the sea [of Galilee]. And a very large crowd gathered around Him, so He got into a boat [anchoring it a short distance out] on the sea and sat down; and the whole crowd was by the sea on the shore. 
MRK.4.2	And He taught them many things in parables, and in His teaching He said to them, 
MRK.4.8	 [as much as had been sown].” 
MRK.4.9	And He said, 
MRK.4.10	As soon as He was alone, those who were around Him, together with the twelve [disciples], 
MRK.4.11	He said to them, 
MRK.4.12	[from their rejection of the truth] 
MRK.4.13	Then He said to them, 
MRK.4.14	 [of God, the good news regarding the way of salvation]. 
MRK.4.15	 [in the first group] 
MRK.4.16	 [in the second group] 
MRK.4.17	 [are offended and displeased at being associated with Me and] 
MRK.4.19	 [the distractions of this age with its worldly pleasures], 
MRK.4.20	 [in the last group] 
MRK.4.21	He said to them, 
MRK.4.22	 [that is, things are hidden only temporarily, until the appropriate time comes for them to be known]. 
MRK.4.24	Then He said to them, 
MRK.4.25	 [a teachable heart], 
MRK.4.26	Then He said, 
MRK.4.27	 [in the meantime] 
MRK.4.28	 [of grain], 
MRK.4.29	 [to reap], 
MRK.4.30	And He said, 
MRK.4.31	 [other] 
MRK.4.33	With many such parables, Jesus spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear 
MRK.4.34	and He did not say 
MRK.4.35	On that [same] day, when evening had come, He said to them, 
MRK.4.36	So leaving the crowd, they took Him with them, just as He was, in the boat. And other boats were with Him. 
MRK.4.37	And a 
MRK.4.38	But Jesus was in the stern, asleep [with His head] on the [sailor’s leather] cushion. And they woke Him and said to Him, “Teacher, do You not care that we are about to die?” 
MRK.4.39	And He got up and [sternly] rebuked the wind and said to the sea, 
MRK.4.40	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.4.41	They were filled with great fear, and said to each other, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?”
MRK.5.1	They came to the 
MRK.5.2	When Jesus got out of the boat, immediately a man from the tombs with an unclean spirit met Him, 
MRK.5.3	and the man lived in the 
MRK.5.4	For he had often been bound with shackles [for the feet] and with chains, and he tore apart the chains and broke the shackles into pieces, and no one was strong enough to subdue 
MRK.5.5	Night and day he was constantly screaming 
MRK.5.6	Seeing Jesus from a distance, he ran up and bowed down before Him [in homage]; 
MRK.5.7	and screaming with a loud voice, he said, “
MRK.5.8	For Jesus had been saying to him, 
MRK.5.9	He was asking him, 
MRK.5.10	And he 
MRK.5.11	Now there was a large herd of pigs grazing there on the mountain. 
MRK.5.12	And 
MRK.5.13	Jesus gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out [of the man] and entered the pigs. The herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea; and they were drowned [one after the other] in the sea.
MRK.5.14	The herdsmen [tending the pigs] ran away and reported it in the city and in the country. And 
MRK.5.15	They came to Jesus and saw the man who had been demon-possessed sitting down, clothed and in his right mind, the man who had [previously] had the “legion” [of demons]; and they were frightened. 
MRK.5.16	Those who had seen it described [in detail] to the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man, and [told them all] about the pigs. 
MRK.5.17	So the people began to beg with Jesus to leave their region. 
MRK.5.18	As He was stepping into the boat, the [Gentile] man who had been demon-possessed was begging with Him [asking] that he might go with Him [as a disciple]. 
MRK.5.19	Jesus did not let him [come], but [instead] He said to him, 
MRK.5.20	So he [obeyed and] went away and began to publicly proclaim in Decapolis [the region of the ten Hellenistic cities] all the great things that Jesus had done for him; and all the people were astonished.
MRK.5.21	When Jesus had again crossed over in the boat to the other side [of the sea], a large crowd gathered around Him; and so He stayed by the seashore. 
MRK.5.22	One of the synagogue officials named Jairus came up; and seeing Him, fell at His feet 
MRK.5.23	and begged anxiously with Him, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death; [please] come and lay Your hands on her, so that she will be healed and live.” 
MRK.5.24	And Jesus went with him; and a large crowd followed Him and pressed in around Him [from all sides].
MRK.5.25	A woman [in the crowd] had [suffered from] a hemorrhage for twelve years, 
MRK.5.26	and had endured much [suffering] at the hands of many physicians. She had spent all that she had and was not helped at all, but instead had become worse. 
MRK.5.27	She had heard [reports] about Jesus, and she came up behind Him in the crowd and touched His outer robe. 
MRK.5.28	For she thought, “If I just touch His clothing, I will get well.” 
MRK.5.29	Immediately her flow of blood was dried up; and she felt in her body [and knew without any doubt] that she was healed of her suffering. 
MRK.5.30	Immediately Jesus, recognizing in Himself that power had gone out from Him, turned around in the crowd and asked, 
MRK.5.31	His disciples said to Him, “You see the crowd pressing in around You [from all sides], and You ask, ‘Who touched Me?’ ” 
MRK.5.32	Still He kept looking around to see the woman who had done it. 
MRK.5.33	And the woman, though she was afraid and trembling, aware of what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth. 
MRK.5.34	Then He said to her, 
MRK.5.35	While He was still speaking, some people came from the synagogue official’s house, saying [to Jairus], “Your daughter has died; why bother the Teacher any longer?” 
MRK.5.36	Overhearing what was being said, Jesus said to the synagogue official, 
MRK.5.37	And He allowed no one to go with Him [as witnesses], except Peter and 
MRK.5.38	They came to the house of the synagogue official; and He looked [with understanding] at the uproar 
MRK.5.39	When He had gone in, He said to them, 
MRK.5.40	They 
MRK.5.41	Taking the child’s hand, He said [tenderly] to her, 
MRK.5.42	The little girl immediately got up and 
MRK.5.43	He gave strict orders that no one should know about this, and He told them to give her 
MRK.6.1	Jesus left there and came to His hometown [Nazareth]; and His disciples followed Him. 
MRK.6.2	When the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue; and many who listened to Him were astonished, saying, “Where did this man get these things [this knowledge and spiritual insight]? What is this wisdom [this confident understanding of the Scripture] that has been given to Him, and such miracles as these performed by His hands? 
MRK.6.3	Is this not the carpenter, 
MRK.6.4	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.6.5	And He could not do a miracle there at all [because of their unbelief] except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them. 
MRK.6.6	He wondered at their unbelief.
MRK.6.7	And He called the twelve [disciples] and began to send them out [as His special messengers] two by two, and gave them authority 
MRK.6.8	He told them to take nothing for the journey except a mere walking stick—no bread, no [traveler’s] bag, no money in their belts— 
MRK.6.9	but to wear sandals; and [He told them] not to wear 
MRK.6.10	And He told them, 
MRK.6.11	 [breaking all ties with them because they rejected My message].” 
MRK.6.12	So they went out and preached that men should repent [that is, think differently, recognize sin, turn away from it, and live changed lives]. 
MRK.6.13	And they were casting out many demons and were anointing with oil many who were sick, and healing them.
MRK.6.14	King Herod [Antipas] heard about this, for Jesus’ name 
MRK.6.15	But others were saying, “He is 
MRK.6.16	But when Herod heard [of it], he kept saying, “John, whom I beheaded, has risen [from the dead]!”
MRK.6.17	For Herod himself had sent [guards] and had John arrested and shackled in prison because of 
MRK.6.18	For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not lawful [under Mosaic Law] for you to have your brother’s wife.” 
MRK.6.19	Herodias had a grudge against John and wanted to kill him, but she could not, 
MRK.6.20	because Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he 
MRK.6.21	But an opportune time [finally] came [for Herodias]. Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his officials (nobles, courtiers) and 
MRK.6.22	Now [Salome] the daughter of Herodias came in and danced [for the men]. She pleased 
MRK.6.23	And he swore to her, “Whatever you ask me, I will give it to you; 
MRK.6.24	She went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask for?” And Herodias replied, “The head of John the Baptist!” 
MRK.6.25	And she rushed back to the king and asked, saying, “I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter!” 
MRK.6.26	The king was deeply grieved, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests [who might have regarded him as weak], he was unwilling to [break his word and] refuse her. 
MRK.6.27	So the king immediately sent for an executioner and commanded him to bring back John’s head. And he went and had John beheaded in the prison, 
MRK.6.28	and brought back his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother. 
MRK.6.29	When his disciples heard 
MRK.6.30	The apostles [who had been sent out on a mission] gathered together with Jesus and told Him everything that they had done and taught. 
MRK.6.31	He said to them, 
MRK.6.32	And they went away by themselves in the boat to a secluded place. 
MRK.6.33	Many [people] saw them leaving, and recognized 
MRK.6.34	When Jesus went ashore, He saw a large crowd [waiting], and He was moved with compassion for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd [lacking guidance]; and He began to teach them many things. 
MRK.6.35	When the day was nearly gone, His disciples came to Him and said, “This is an isolated place, and it is already late; 
MRK.6.36	send the crowds away so that they may go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.” 
MRK.6.37	But He replied, 
MRK.6.38	He said to them, 
MRK.6.39	Then Jesus commanded them all to sit down by groups on the green grass. 
MRK.6.40	They sat down in groups of hundreds and of fifties [so that the crowd resembled an orderly arrangement of colorful garden plots]. 
MRK.6.41	Taking the five loaves and two fish, He looked up to heaven and said a blessing [of praise and thanksgiving to the Father]. Then He broke the loaves and [repeatedly] gave them to the disciples to set before the people; and He divided up the two fish among them all. 
MRK.6.42	They all ate and were satisfied. 
MRK.6.43	And the disciples picked up twelve full baskets of the broken pieces [of the loaves], and of the fish. 
MRK.6.44	Those who ate the loaves were five thousand men [not counting the women and children].
MRK.6.45	Jesus immediately insisted that His disciples get into the boat and go ahead [of Him] to the other side to Bethsaida, while He was dismissing the crowd. 
MRK.6.46	And after He said goodbye to them, He went to the mountain to pray.
MRK.6.47	Now when evening had come, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and Jesus was alone on the land. 
MRK.6.48	Seeing the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them, at about the fourth watch of the night (3:00-6:00 a.m.) He came to them, walking on the sea. And [acted as if] He intended to pass by them. 
MRK.6.49	But when they saw Him walking on the sea, they thought it was a ghost, and cried out [in horror]; 
MRK.6.50	for they all saw Him and were shaken 
MRK.6.51	Then He got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased [as if exhausted by its own activity]; and they were completely overwhelmed, 
MRK.6.52	because they had not understood [the miracle of] the loaves [how it revealed the power and deity of Jesus]; but [in fact] their heart was hardened [being oblivious and indifferent to His amazing works].
MRK.6.53	When they had crossed over [the sea], they reached the land of Gennesaret and anchored at the shore. 
MRK.6.54	They got out of the boat and immediately 
MRK.6.55	and ran throughout that surrounding countryside and began to carry around on their mats those who were sick, to any place where they heard He was. 
MRK.6.56	And wherever He came into villages, or cities, or the countryside, they were laying the sick in the market places and pleading with Him [to allow them] just to touch the fringe (tassel with a blue cord) of His robe; and all who touched it were healed.
MRK.7.1	Now the Pharisees and some of the scribes came from Jerusalem and gathered around Him, 
MRK.7.2	and they had seen that some of His disciples ate their bread with [ceremonially] impure hands, that is, unwashed [and defiled according to Jewish religious ritual]. 
MRK.7.3	(
MRK.7.4	and 
MRK.7.5	So the Pharisees and scribes asked Jesus, “Why do Your disciples not live their lives according to the tradition of the elders, but [instead] eat their bread with [ceremonially] unwashed hands?” 
MRK.7.6	He replied, 
MRK.7.9	He was also saying to them, 
MRK.7.10	 [with respect and gratitude]’; 
MRK.7.11	 [Pharisees and scribes] 
MRK.7.12	 [since helping them would violate his vow of Corban]; 
MRK.7.13	 [authority of the] 
MRK.7.14	After He called the people to Him again, He 
MRK.7.15	 [such as food] 
MRK.7.17	When Jesus had left the crowd and gone into the 
MRK.7.18	And He said to them, 
MRK.7.19	 [only] 
MRK.7.20	And He said, 
MRK.7.21	 [that is] 
MRK.7.23	 [schemes and desires] 
MRK.7.24	Jesus got up and left there and went to the region of Tyre [and Sidon, the coastal area of Phoenicia]. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know 
MRK.7.25	Instead, after hearing about Him, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately came and fell at His feet. 
MRK.7.26	Now the woman was a Gentile (Greek), a 
MRK.7.27	He was saying to her, 
MRK.7.28	But she replied, “Yes, Lord, but even the pet dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.” 
MRK.7.29	And He said to her, 
MRK.7.30	And returning to her home, she found the child lying on the couch [relaxed and resting], the demon having gone.
MRK.7.31	Soon after this Jesus left the region of Tyre, and passed through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, through the region of Decapolis [the ten Hellenistic cities]. 
MRK.7.32	They brought to Him a man who was deaf and had difficulty speaking, and they begged Jesus to place His hand on him. 
MRK.7.33	Jesus, taking him aside by himself, away from the crowd, put His fingers into the man’s ears, and after spitting, He touched the man’s tongue [with the saliva]; 
MRK.7.34	and looking up to heaven, He sighed deeply and said to the man, 
MRK.7.35	And his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he 
MRK.7.36	Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone; but the more He ordered them, the more widely they continued to proclaim it. 
MRK.7.37	They were thoroughly astounded 
MRK.8.1	In those days, when there was again a large crowd [gathered before Him] and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called His disciples and told them, 
MRK.8.2	 [left] 
MRK.8.3	 [from exhaustion] 
MRK.8.4	His disciples replied to Him, “Where will anyone be able to find enough bread here in this isolated place to feed these people?” 
MRK.8.5	He asked them, 
MRK.8.6	He directed the people to sit down on the ground; and taking the seven loaves, He gave thanks and broke them, and [repeatedly] gave them to His disciples to set before them, and they served the crowd. 
MRK.8.7	They also had a few small fish; and when Jesus had blessed them [and given thanks], He ordered these [fish] to be set before them as well. 
MRK.8.8	And the people ate and were satisfied; and they picked up seven large baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over. 
MRK.8.9	About four thousand [men] were there [besides women and children]; and He sent them away. 
MRK.8.10	Then immediately He got into the boat with His disciples and went to the district of 
MRK.8.11	The Pharisees came out and began to argue [contentiously and debate] with Him, demanding from Him a sign from heaven, to test Him [because of their unbelief]. 
MRK.8.12	He groaned 
MRK.8.13	Leaving them, He again boarded the boat and left for the other side.
MRK.8.14	Now the disciples had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat. 
MRK.8.15	Jesus repeatedly ordered them, saying, 
MRK.8.16	They 
MRK.8.17	Jesus, aware of this [discussion], said to them, 
MRK.8.18	 [to what I have said]? 
MRK.8.19	 They answered, “Twelve.” 
MRK.8.20	 [when I broke] 
MRK.8.21	And He was saying to them, 
MRK.8.22	Then they came to Bethsaida; and some people brought a blind man to Jesus and begged Him to touch him. 
MRK.8.23	Taking the blind man by the hand, He led him out of the village; and after spitting on his eyes and laying His hands on him, He asked him, 
MRK.8.24	And he looked up and said, “I see people, but [they look] like trees, walking around.” 
MRK.8.25	Then again Jesus laid His hands on his eyes; and the man stared intently and [his sight] was [completely] restored, and he 
MRK.8.26	And He sent him to his home, saying, 
MRK.8.27	Then Jesus and His disciples went out to the villages of 
MRK.8.28	They answered Him, “John the Baptist; and others say Elijah; but others, one of the prophets.” 
MRK.8.29	And He asked them, 
MRK.8.30	Then Jesus strictly warned them not to tell anyone about Him.
MRK.8.31	And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must [of necessity] suffer many things and be rejected [as the Messiah] by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and must be put to death, and after three days rise [from death to life]. 
MRK.8.32	He was stating the matter plainly [not holding anything back]. Then Peter took Him aside and began to reprimand Him. 
MRK.8.33	But turning around [with His back to Peter] and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, 
MRK.8.34	Jesus called the crowd together with His disciples, and said to them, 
MRK.8.35	 [in this world] 
MRK.8.36	 [with all its pleasures], 
MRK.8.37	 [in God’s kingdom]? 
MRK.8.38	 [here and now] 
MRK.9.1	And Jesus said to them, 
MRK.9.2	Six days later, Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John, and led them up on a high mountain by themselves. And He was transfigured (changed in form) before them [and began to shine brightly with divine and regal glory]; 
MRK.9.3	and His clothes became radiant 
MRK.9.4	Elijah appeared to them along with Moses, and they were having a conversation with Jesus. 
MRK.9.5	Peter responded and said to Jesus, “Rabbi (Master), it is good for us to be here; let us make three [sacred] tents—one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” 
MRK.9.6	For he did not [really] know what to say because they were terrified [and stunned by the miraculous sight]. 
MRK.9.7	Then a cloud formed, overshadowing them, and 
MRK.9.8	Suddenly they looked around and no longer saw anyone with them, except Jesus alone.
MRK.9.9	As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus expressly ordered them not to tell anyone what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. 
MRK.9.10	So they [carefully and faithfully] kept the matter to themselves, 
MRK.9.11	They asked Him, saying, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first [before the Messiah comes]?” 
MRK.9.12	He answered them, 
MRK.9.13	 [already], 
MRK.9.14	When they came [back] to the [other nine] disciples, they saw a large crowd around them, and scribes questioning 
MRK.9.15	Immediately, when the entire crowd saw Jesus, they were startled and 
MRK.9.16	He asked them, 
MRK.9.17	One of the crowd replied to Him, “Teacher, I brought You my son, possessed with a spirit which makes him unable to speak; 
MRK.9.18	and whenever it seizes him [intending to do harm], it throws him down, and he foams [at the mouth], and grinds his teeth and becomes stiff. I told Your disciples to drive it out, and they could not do it.” 
MRK.9.19	He replied, 
MRK.9.20	They brought the boy to Him. When the [demonic] spirit saw Him, immediately it threw the boy into a convulsion, and falling to the ground he 
MRK.9.21	Jesus asked his father, 
MRK.9.22	The demon has often thrown him both into fire and into water, intending to kill him. But if You can do anything, take pity on us and help us!” 
MRK.9.23	Jesus said to him, “[You say to Me,] 
MRK.9.24	Immediately the father of the boy cried out [with a desperate, piercing cry], saying, “I do believe; help [me overcome] my unbelief.” 
MRK.9.25	When Jesus saw that a crowd was rapidly gathering [around them], He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, 
MRK.9.26	After screaming out and throwing him into a terrible convulsion, it came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse [so still and pale] that many [of the spectators] said, “He is dead!” 
MRK.9.27	But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him; and he stood up. 
MRK.9.28	When He had gone indoors, His disciples 
MRK.9.29	He replied to them, 
MRK.9.30	They went on from there and 
MRK.9.31	because He was teaching His disciples [and preparing them for the future]. He told them, 
MRK.9.32	But 
MRK.9.33	They arrived at Capernaum; and when He was in the 
MRK.9.34	But they kept quiet, because on the road they had discussed 
MRK.9.35	Sitting down [to teach], He called the twelve [disciples] and said to them, 
MRK.9.36	Taking a child, He set him before them; and taking him in His arms, He said to them, 
MRK.9.37	 [only] 
MRK.9.38	John said to Him, “Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we tried to stop him because he was not accompanying us [as Your disciple].” 
MRK.9.39	But Jesus said, 
MRK.9.43	 [that is, remove yourself from the source of temptation]! 
MRK.9.45	 [that is, remove yourself from the source of temptation]! 
MRK.9.47	 [that is, remove yourself from the source of temptation]! 
MRK.9.48	 [that feeds on the dead] 
MRK.10.1	Getting up, He left there (Capernaum) and went to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan; and crowds gathered around Him again 
MRK.10.2	Pharisees came to Jesus to test Him [intending to trick Him into saying something wrong], and asked Him, “Is it lawful [according to Scripture] for a man to divorce his wife 
MRK.10.3	He replied to them, 
MRK.10.4	They said, “Moses allowed 
MRK.10.5	But Jesus said to them, 
MRK.10.7	 [to establish a home with his wife], 
MRK.10.8	 [are united as] 
MRK.10.9	 [by divorce].”
MRK.10.10	In the house the disciples 
MRK.10.11	And He said to them, 
MRK.10.13	People were bringing children to Him so that He would touch 
MRK.10.14	But when Jesus saw this, He was indignant and He said to them, 
MRK.10.16	And He took the children [one by one] in His arms and 
MRK.10.17	As He was leaving on His journey, a man ran up and knelt before Him and asked Him, “Good Teacher [You who are essentially good and morally perfect], what shall I do to inherit eternal life [that is, eternal salvation in the Messiah’s kingdom]?” 
MRK.10.18	Jesus said to him, 
MRK.10.20	And he replied to Him, “Teacher, I have [carefully] kept all these [commandments] since my 
MRK.10.21	Looking at him, Jesus felt a love (high regard, compassion) for him, and He said to him, 
MRK.10.22	But the man was saddened at Jesus’ words, and he left grieving, because he owned much property 
MRK.10.23	Jesus looked around and said to His disciples, 
MRK.10.24	The disciples were 
MRK.10.25	 [who places his faith in wealth or status] 
MRK.10.26	They were completely 
MRK.10.27	Looking at them, Jesus said, 
MRK.10.28	Peter started saying to Him, “Look, we have given up everything and followed You [becoming Your disciples and accepting You as Teacher and Lord].” 
MRK.10.29	Jesus said, 
MRK.10.32	Now they were on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking on ahead of them; and they were perplexed [at what Jesus had said], and those who were following were alarmed 
MRK.10.33	, 
MRK.10.34	 [from the dead].”
MRK.10.35	James and John, the two sons of Zebedee, came to Him, saying, “Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask of You.” 
MRK.10.36	And He replied to them, 
MRK.10.37	They said to Him, “Grant that we may sit [with You], one on Your right and one on 
MRK.10.38	But Jesus said to them, 
MRK.10.39	And they replied to Him, “We are able.” Jesus told them, 
MRK.10.40	 [by My Father].”
MRK.10.41	Hearing this, the [other] ten became indignant with James and John. 
MRK.10.42	Calling them to Himself, Jesus said to them, 
MRK.10.46	Then they came to Jericho. And as He was leaving Jericho with His disciples and a large crowd, a blind beggar, Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting beside the road [as was his custom]. 
MRK.10.47	When Bartimaeus heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout and say, “Jesus, 
MRK.10.48	Many sternly rebuked him, telling him to keep still 
MRK.10.49	Jesus stopped and said, 
MRK.10.50	Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped up and came to Jesus. 
MRK.10.51	And Jesus said, 
MRK.10.52	Jesus said to him, 
MRK.11.1	When they were nearing Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of His disciples, 
MRK.11.2	saying to them, 
MRK.11.4	So they went away [to the village] and found a colt tied outside at a gate in the street, and they untied it. 
MRK.11.5	Some of the people who were standing there said to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?” 
MRK.11.6	They replied to them just as Jesus had directed, and they allowed them to go. 
MRK.11.7	They brought the colt to Jesus and put their coats on it, and He sat on it. 
MRK.11.8	And many [of the people] spread their coats on the road [as an act of tribute and homage before a new king], and others [scattered a layer of] leafy branches which they had cut from the fields [honoring Him as Messiah]. 
MRK.11.9	Those who went in front and those who were following [Him] were shouting [in joy and praise],
MRK.11.9	“Hosanna (
MRK.11.9	B
MRK.11.10	Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!
MRK.11.10	Hosanna in the highest [heaven]!”
MRK.11.11	Jesus entered Jerusalem and went to the temple [enclosure]; and after looking around at everything, He left for Bethany with the twelve [disciples], because it was already late [in the day].
MRK.11.12	On the next day, when they had left Bethany, He was hungry. 
MRK.11.13	Seeing at a distance a fig tree in leaf, He went to see if He would find anything on it. But He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. 
MRK.11.14	He said to it, 
MRK.11.15	Then they came to Jerusalem. And He entered the temple [grounds] and began driving out [with force] the people who were 
MRK.11.16	and He would not permit anyone to carry 
MRK.11.17	He 
MRK.11.18	The chief priests and the scribes heard this and 
MRK.11.19	When evening came, Jesus and His disciples would leave the city.
MRK.11.20	In the morning, as they were passing by, the disciples saw that the fig tree had withered away from the roots up. 
MRK.11.21	And remembering, Peter said to Him, “Rabbi (Master), look! The fig tree which You cursed has withered!” 
MRK.11.22	Jesus replied, 
MRK.11.23	 [in God’s unlimited power], 
MRK.11.24	 [in accordance with God’s will], 
MRK.11.25	 [drop the issue, let it go], 
MRK.11.27	They came again to Jerusalem. And as Jesus was walking in the [courts and porches of the] temple, the 
MRK.11.28	and 
MRK.11.29	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.11.30	 [the Baptist] 
MRK.11.31	They 
MRK.11.32	But 
MRK.11.33	So they replied to Jesus, “We do not know.” And Jesus said to them, 
MRK.12.1	Jesus began to speak to them [the chief priests, scribes and elders who were questioning Him] in parables: 
MRK.12.4	 [threw stones and] 
MRK.12.7	 [and destroy the evidence], 
MRK.12.12	And they were looking for a way to seize Him, but they were afraid of the crowd; for they knew that He spoke this parable in reference to [and as a charge against] them. And so they left Him and went away.
MRK.12.13	Then they sent some of the 
MRK.12.14	They came and said to Him, “Teacher, we know that You are truthful and have no personal bias toward anyone; for You are not influenced by outward appearances 
MRK.12.15	Should we pay [the tax] or should we not pay?” But knowing their hypocrisy, He asked them, 
MRK.12.16	So they brought one. Then He asked them, 
MRK.12.17	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.12.18	Some Sadducees (who say that there is no resurrection) came to Him, and 
MRK.12.19	“Teacher, Moses wrote for us [a law] that 
MRK.12.20	There were seven brothers; the first [one] took a wife, and died leaving no children. 
MRK.12.21	The second brother married her, and died leaving no children; and the third likewise; 
MRK.12.22	and so all seven [married her and died, and] left no children. Last of all the woman died also. 
MRK.12.23	In the resurrection, whose wife will she be? For all seven [brothers] were married to her.” 
MRK.12.24	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.12.28	Then one of the scribes [an expert in Mosaic Law] came up and listened to them arguing [with one another], and noticing that Jesus answered them well, asked Him, “Which commandment is first 
MRK.12.29	Jesus answered, 
MRK.12.31	 [unselfishly] 
MRK.12.32	The scribe said to Him, “Admirably answered, Teacher; You truthfully stated that H
MRK.12.33	 H
MRK.12.34	When Jesus saw that he answered thoughtfully 
MRK.12.35	Jesus 
MRK.12.36	 [when inspired] 
MRK.12.38	In [the course of] His teaching He was saying, 
MRK.12.39	 [they love] 
MRK.12.40	[these scribes] 
MRK.12.41	And He sat down opposite the [temple] treasury, and 
MRK.12.42	A poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which amount to a 
MRK.12.43	Calling His disciples to Him, He said to them, 
MRK.13.1	As He was coming out of the temple [grounds], one of His disciples said to Him, “Teacher, look what 
MRK.13.2	Jesus replied to him, 
MRK.13.3	As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked Him privately, 
MRK.13.4	“Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be fulfilled?” 
MRK.13.5	Jesus began to say to them, 
MRK.13.6	 [misusing My name or claiming to be the Messiah], 
MRK.13.8	 [the intolerable anguish and suffering].
MRK.13.10	 [that is, the good news regarding the way of salvation] 
MRK.13.11	 [to the court], 
MRK.13.12	 [be put to] 
MRK.13.13	 [your association with] 
MRK.13.15	 [to enter the house], 
MRK.13.19	 [be again]. 
MRK.13.20	 [for Himself], 
MRK.13.22	 [such a thing were] 
MRK.13.26	 [in royal majesty and splendor]. 
MRK.13.27	 [those He has chosen for Himself] 
MRK.13.29	 [for certain] 
MRK.13.30	 [the people living when these signs and events begin] 
MRK.13.31	 [as now known] 
MRK.13.32	 [exact] 
MRK.13.36	[stay alert,] 
MRK.13.37	 [stay awake and be continually cautious]!’ ”
MRK.14.1	It was now two days before the Passover and [the festival of] Unleavened Bread, and the chief priests and the scribes were searching for a deceitful way to arrest Jesus and kill 
MRK.14.2	but they were saying, “Not during the festival, for the people might riot.”
MRK.14.3	While He was in Bethany [as a guest] at the home of 
MRK.14.4	But there were 
MRK.14.5	For this perfume might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii [a laborer’s wages for almost a year], and 
MRK.14.6	But Jesus said, 
MRK.14.9	 good news [regarding salvation] 
MRK.14.10	Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve [disciples], went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them. 
MRK.14.11	When they heard this they were delighted, and promised to give him money. And he 
MRK.14.12	On the first day [of the festival] of 
MRK.14.13	And He sent two of His disciples, saying to them, 
MRK.14.15	 [with carpets and dining couches]; 
MRK.14.16	The disciples left and went to the city and found everything just as He had told them, and they prepared the Passover.
MRK.14.17	When it was evening, He came with the twelve [disciples]. 
MRK.14.18	While they were reclining 
MRK.14.19	They began to be grieved 
MRK.14.20	And He replied, 
MRK.14.21	 [to the cross] 
MRK.14.22	While they were eating, Jesus took bread and 
MRK.14.23	And when He had taken a cup [of wine] and 
MRK.14.24	And He said to them, 
MRK.14.26	After they had sung a 
MRK.14.27	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.14.28	 [from the dead], 
MRK.14.29	But Peter said to Him, “Even if they all fall away [and desert You, ashamed and afraid of being associated with You], yet I will not [do so]!” 
MRK.14.30	Jesus said to him, 
MRK.14.31	But Peter kept saying insistently, “If I have to die with You, I will not deny You!” And they all were saying the same thing as well.
MRK.14.32	Then they went to a place called Gethsemane; and Jesus said to His disciples, 
MRK.14.33	He took Peter and James and John with Him, and He began to be deeply distressed and troubled [extremely anguished at the prospect of what was to come]. 
MRK.14.34	And He said to them, 
MRK.14.35	After going a little farther, He fell to the ground [distressed by the weight of His spiritual burden] and 
MRK.14.36	He was saying, 
MRK.14.37	And He came back and found them sleeping, and He said to Peter, 
MRK.14.38	 [actively] 
MRK.14.39	He went away again and prayed, saying the same words. 
MRK.14.40	And again He came back and found them sleeping, because their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know how to answer Him. 
MRK.14.41	He came back a third time and said to them, 
MRK.14.43	And at once, while He was still speaking, Judas [Iscariot], one of the twelve [disciples], came up, and with him a crowd of men with swords and clubs, 
MRK.14.44	Now the betrayer had given them a signal, saying, “Whomever I kiss, He is the one; seize Him and lead Him away safely [under guard].” 
MRK.14.45	When Judas came, immediately he went up to Jesus and said, “Rabbi (Master)!” and he 
MRK.14.46	They laid hands on Him and seized Him. 
MRK.14.47	But one of the bystanders [Simon Peter] drew his sword and struck [Malchus] the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear. 
MRK.14.48	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.14.49	 [courts and porches of the] 
MRK.14.50	Then all of His disciples abandoned Him and fled.
MRK.14.51	A young 
MRK.14.52	But pulling free of the linen sheet, he escaped [from them] naked.
MRK.14.53	They led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court) gathered together. 
MRK.14.54	Peter had followed Him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the officers [guards and servants] and warming himself at the fire. 
MRK.14.55	Now the chief priests and the entire Council (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court) were trying to obtain testimony against Jesus [which they could use] to have Him [condemned and] executed, but they were not finding any. 
MRK.14.56	For many [people] were giving false testimony against Him, but their testimonies were not consistent. 
MRK.14.57	Some stood up and 
MRK.14.58	“We heard Him say, ‘I will destroy this temple (sanctuary) that was made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.’ ” 
MRK.14.59	Not even in this respect was their testimony consistent. 
MRK.14.60	The high priest stood up and came forward and asked Jesus, “Have You no answer to give [in response] to what these men are testifying against You?” 
MRK.14.61	But Jesus kept silent and gave no answer at all. Again the high priest was questioning Him, and saying to Him, “Are You the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed), the Son of the 
MRK.14.62	Jesus said, 
MRK.14.63	Then 
MRK.14.64	You have heard the blasphemy [that is, His claim to be the Son of God]. What is your decision?” And they all condemned Him to be [guilty and] deserving of death. 
MRK.14.65	And some began to spit on Him, and to blindfold Him, and to beat Him with their fists, and to say to Him, “Prophesy [by telling us who hit you]!” Then the officers took custody of Him and struck him in the face.
MRK.14.66	While Peter was down below in the courtyard, one of the servant-girls of the high priest came, 
MRK.14.67	and when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked intently at him and said, “You were with Jesus the Nazarene, too.” 
MRK.14.68	But he denied it, saying, “I neither know nor understand what you are talking about.” Then he went out [of the courtyard] to the porch, 
MRK.14.69	The servant-girl saw him, and began once more to tell the bystanders, “This [man] is 
MRK.14.70	But again he denied it. After a little while, the bystanders again said to Peter, “You are in fact 
MRK.14.71	But he began to 
MRK.14.72	Immediately a rooster crowed the second time. And Peter remembered what Jesus said to him: 
MRK.15.1	Early in the morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes and the whole Council (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court), immediately consulted together; and they bound Jesus, they took Him away [violently] and handed Him over to Pilate. 
MRK.15.2	Pilate questioned Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” And He replied to him, 
MRK.15.3	The chief priests 
MRK.15.4	Then Pilate again asked Him, “Have You no answer [to give]? See how many charges they are bringing against You!” 
MRK.15.5	But Jesus gave no further answer; so Pilate was perplexed.
MRK.15.6	Now at the [Passover] feast Pilate used to set free for them any one prisoner whom they requested. 
MRK.15.7	The man called Barabbas was imprisoned with the insurrectionists (revolutionaries) who had committed murder in the civil rebellion. 
MRK.15.8	The crowd came up and began asking Pilate to do as he usually did for them. 
MRK.15.9	Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to set free for you the King of the Jews?” 
MRK.15.10	For he was aware that the chief priests had turned Jesus over to him because of envy 
MRK.15.11	But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to get him to release Barabbas for them instead. 
MRK.15.12	Again Pilate answered, “Then what shall I do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?” 
MRK.15.13	They screamed back, “Crucify Him!” 
MRK.15.14	But Pilate asked them, “Why, what has He done that is evil?” But they screamed all the more, “Crucify Him!” 
MRK.15.15	So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, set Barabbas free for them; and after having Jesus 
MRK.15.16	The soldiers led Him away into the palace (that is, the 
MRK.15.17	They dressed Him up in [a ranking Roman officer’s robe of] purple, and after twisting [together] a crown of thorns, they placed it on Him; 
MRK.15.18	and they began saluting 
MRK.15.19	They kept beating Him on the head with a 
MRK.15.20	After they had mocked Him, they took off the purple robe and put His own clothes on Him. And they led Him out [of the city] to crucify Him.
MRK.15.21	They forced into service a passer-by coming in from the countryside, Simon of 
MRK.15.22	Then they brought Him to the place [called] Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a 
MRK.15.23	They tried to give Him 
MRK.15.24	And they crucified Him, and 
MRK.15.25	It was the third hour (9:00 a.m.) when they crucified Him. 
MRK.15.26	The inscription of the accusation against Him had been written [above Him]: “THE KING OF THE JEWS.”
MRK.15.27	They crucified two robbers with Him, one on His right and one on His left. 
MRK.15.28	And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “He was counted with the transgressors.”
MRK.15.29	Those who were passing by were insulting Him with abusive 
MRK.15.30	save Yourself by coming down from the cross!” 
MRK.15.31	In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes, were ridiculing 
MRK.15.32	Let the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed), the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, so that we may see and believe 
MRK.15.33	When the sixth hour (noon) came, darkness covered the whole land until the ninth hour (3:00 p.m.). 
MRK.15.34	And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, 
MRK.15.35	Some of the bystanders heard Him and said, “Look! He is calling for 
MRK.15.36	Someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed and gave Him a drink, saying, “Let us see whether Elijah is coming to take Him down.” 
MRK.15.37	But Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed out His last [voluntarily, sovereignly dismissing and releasing His spirit from His body in submission to His Father’s plan]. 
MRK.15.38	And the veil [of the Holy of Holies] of the temple was torn in two from 
MRK.15.39	When the centurion, who was standing opposite Him, saw the way He breathed His last [being fully in control], he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”
MRK.15.40	Now some women also were watching from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and 
MRK.15.41	When Jesus was in Galilee, they used to accompany him and minister to Him; and 
MRK.15.42	When evening had already come, because it was the preparation day, that is, the day before the Sabbath, 
MRK.15.43	Joseph of Arimathea came, a prominent 
MRK.15.44	Pilate 
MRK.15.45	And when he learned from the centurion [that Jesus was in fact dead], he gave the body to Joseph [by granting him permission to remove it]. 
MRK.15.46	So Joseph purchased a [fine] linen cloth [for 
MRK.15.47	Mary Magdalene and Mary the 
MRK.16.1	When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the 
MRK.16.2	Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen. 
MRK.16.3	And they were saying to one another, “Who will roll back the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?” 
MRK.16.4	Looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away, though it was extremely large. 
MRK.16.5	Entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right, wearing a [long, stately] white robe; and they were amazed 
MRK.16.6	And he said to them, “Do not be amazed; you are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen; He is not here. See, [here is] the place where they laid Him. 
MRK.16.7	But go, tell His disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you to Galilee; you will see Him there, just as He told you.’ ” 
MRK.16.8	They went out and fled from the tomb, for they were seized with trembling and astonishment; and they said nothing [about it] to anyone, because they were afraid.
MRK.16.10	She went and reported it to those who had been with Him, while they were mourning and weeping. 
MRK.16.11	When they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe it.
MRK.16.12	After that, He appeared in a different form to two of them as they were walking along the way to the country. 
MRK.16.13	They returned [to Jerusalem] and told the others, but they did not believe them either.
MRK.16.14	Later, Jesus appeared to the eleven [disciples] themselves as they were reclining 
MRK.16.15	And He said to them, 
MRK.16.16	 [in Me] 
MRK.16.19	So then, when the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. 
MRK.16.20	And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord was working with them and confirming the word by the signs that followed.
LUK.1.1	Since [as is well known] many have undertaken to compile an orderly account of the things which have been fulfilled among us [by God], 
LUK.1.2	exactly as they were handed down to us by those [with personal experience] who from the beginning [of Christ’s ministry] were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word [that is, of the teaching concerning salvation through faith in Christ], 
LUK.1.3	it seemed fitting for 
LUK.1.4	so that you may know the exact truth about the things you have been 
LUK.1.5	In the days of Herod [the Great], king of Judea, there was a certain priest whose name was 
LUK.1.6	They both were righteous (approved) in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and requirements of the Lord. 
LUK.1.7	But they were childless, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both far advanced in years.
LUK.1.8	Now it happened while Zacharias was serving as priest before God in the 
LUK.1.9	as was the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot to enter [the sanctuary of] the temple of the Lord and 
LUK.1.10	And all the congregation was praying outside [in the court of the temple] at the hour of the incense offering. 
LUK.1.11	And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing to the right of the altar of incense. 
LUK.1.12	When Zacharias saw 
LUK.1.13	But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zacharias, because your petition [in prayer] was heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will name him 
LUK.1.14	You will have great joy and delight, and many will rejoice over his birth, 
LUK.1.15	for he will be great 
LUK.1.16	He will turn many of the sons of Israel back [from sin] to [love and serve] the Lord their God. 
LUK.1.17	It is he who will go 
LUK.1.18	And Zacharias said to the angel, “How will I be certain of this? For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in age.” 
LUK.1.19	The angel replied and said to him, “I am Gabriel; I stand 
LUK.1.20	Listen carefully, you will be 
LUK.1.21	The people [outside in the court] were waiting for Zacharias, and were wondering about his 
LUK.1.22	But when he did come out, he was unable to speak to them. They realized that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he kept making signs to them, and remained mute. 
LUK.1.23	When his time of priestly service was finished, he returned to his home.
LUK.1.24	Now after this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant, and for five months she secluded herself completely, saying, 
LUK.1.25	“This is how the Lord has dealt with me in the days when He looked with favor on 
LUK.1.26	Now in the sixth month [of Elizabeth’s pregnancy] the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth, 
LUK.1.27	to a virgin 
LUK.1.28	And coming to her, the angel said, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.” 
LUK.1.29	But she was greatly perplexed at what he said, and kept carefully considering what kind of greeting this was. 
LUK.1.30	The angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. 
LUK.1.31	Listen carefully: you will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son, and you shall name Him Jesus. 
LUK.1.32	He will be great 
LUK.1.33	and He will reign over the house of Jacob (Israel) forever, and of His kingdom there shall be no end.” 
LUK.1.34	Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I am a virgin 
LUK.1.35	Then the angel replied to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you [like a cloud]; for that reason the holy (pure, sinless) Child shall be called the Son of God. 
LUK.1.36	And listen, even your relative Elizabeth has also conceived a son in her old age; and she who was called barren is now in her sixth month. 
LUK.1.37	For with God nothing [is or ever] shall be impossible.” 
LUK.1.38	Then Mary said, “
LUK.1.39	Now at this time Mary arose and hurried to the hill country, to a city of Judah (Judea), 
LUK.1.40	and she entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. 
LUK.1.41	When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, her baby leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit 
LUK.1.42	And she exclaimed loudly, “Blessed [worthy to be praised] are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! 
LUK.1.43	And how has it 
LUK.1.44	For behold, when the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. 
LUK.1.45	And blessed [spiritually fortunate and favored by God] is she who believed 
LUK.1.46	And Mary said,
LUK.1.46	“My soul magnifies 
LUK.1.47	And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.
LUK.1.48	For He has looked [with loving care] on the humble state of His maidservant;
LUK.1.48	For behold, from now on all generations will count me blessed 
LUK.1.49	For He who is mighty has done great things for me;
LUK.1.49	And holy is His name [to be worshiped in His purity, majesty, and glory].
LUK.1.50	A
LUK.1.50	T
LUK.1.51	He has done mighty deeds with His [powerful] arm;
LUK.1.51	He has scattered 
LUK.1.52	He has brought down rulers from 
LUK.1.52	And exalted those who were humble.
LUK.1.53	H
LUK.1.53	And sent the rich away empty-handed.
LUK.1.54	He has helped His servant Israel,
LUK.1.54	In remembrance of His mercy,
LUK.1.55	Just as He promised to our fathers,
LUK.1.55	To Abraham and to his descendants forever.”
LUK.1.56	And Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months, and then returned to her home.
LUK.1.57	Now the time had come for Elizabeth to give birth, and she gave birth to a son. 
LUK.1.58	Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown His great mercy toward her, and they were rejoicing with her.
LUK.1.59	It happened that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child [as required by the Law], and they intended to name him Zacharias, after his father; 
LUK.1.60	but his mother answered, “No indeed; instead he will be called John.” 
LUK.1.61	And they said to her, “None of your relatives is called by that name.” 
LUK.1.62	Then they made signs to his father, as to what he wanted him called. 
LUK.1.63	And he asked for a 
LUK.1.64	At once Zacharias’ mouth was opened and his tongue 
LUK.1.65	Then fear came on all their neighbors; and all these things were discussed throughout the hill country of Judea. 
LUK.1.66	All who heard these things kept them in mind, saying, “What then will this little boy 
LUK.1.67	Now Zacharias his father was filled with the Holy Spirit 
LUK.1.68	“Blessed (praised, glorified) be the Lord, the God of Israel,
LUK.1.68	Because He has visited us and brought redemption to His people,
LUK.1.69	And He has raised up a 
LUK.1.69	In the house of David His servant—
LUK.1.70	Just as He promised by the mouth of His holy prophets from the most ancient times—
LUK.1.71	Salvation 
LUK.1.71	And 
LUK.1.72	To show mercy [as He promised] to our fathers,
LUK.1.72	And to remember His holy covenant [the promised blessing],
LUK.1.73	The oath which He swore to Abraham our father,
LUK.1.74	To grant us that we, being rescued from the hand of our enemies,
LUK.1.74	Might serve Him without fear,
LUK.1.75	In holiness [being set apart] and righteousness [being upright] before Him all our days.
LUK.1.76	And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High;
LUK.1.76	For you will go on 
LUK.1.77	To give His people the knowledge of salvation
LUK.1.77	By the forgiveness of their sins,
LUK.1.78	Because of the tender mercy of our God,
LUK.1.78	With which the Sunrise (the Messiah) from on high will dawn 
LUK.1.79	T
LUK.1.79	To guide our feet [in a straight line] into the way of peace 
LUK.1.80	The child continued to grow and to become strong in spirit, and he lived in the deserts until the day of his public appearance to Israel [as John the Baptist, the forerunner of the Messiah].
LUK.2.1	Now in those days a decree went out from [the emperor] 
LUK.2.2	This was the first census taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria. 
LUK.2.3	And everyone went to register for the census, each to his own city. 
LUK.2.4	So Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David, 
LUK.2.5	in order to register with Mary, who was 
LUK.2.6	While they were there [in Bethlehem], the time came for her to give birth, 
LUK.2.7	and she gave birth to her Son, her firstborn; and she wrapped Him in [
LUK.2.8	In the same region there were shepherds staying out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. 
LUK.2.9	And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the Lord flashed 
LUK.2.10	But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for 
LUK.2.11	For this day in the city of David there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord (the Messiah). 
LUK.2.12	And this will be a sign for you [by which you will recognize Him]: you will find a Baby wrapped in [swaddling] cloths and lying in a manger.” 
LUK.2.13	Then suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host (angelic army) praising God and saying,
LUK.2.14	“Glory to God in the highest [heaven],
LUK.2.14	And on earth peace among men with whom He is well-pleased.”
LUK.2.15	When the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds 
LUK.2.16	So they went in a hurry and found their way to Mary and Joseph, and the Baby as He lay in the manger. 
LUK.2.17	And when they had seen this, they made known what had been told them about this Child, 
LUK.2.18	and all who heard it were astounded 
LUK.2.19	But Mary treasured all these things, giving careful thought to them 
LUK.2.20	The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, just as it had been told them.
LUK.2.21	At the end of eight days, when He was to be circumcised, He was named Jesus, the name given [to Him] by the angel [Gabriel] before He was conceived in the womb.
LUK.2.22	And when the time for their purification came [that is, the mother’s purification and the baby’s dedication] according to the Law of Moses, they brought Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord [set apart as the Firstborn] 
LUK.2.23	(as it is written in the Law of the Lord, “E
LUK.2.24	and [they came also] to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord [to be appropriate for a family of modest means], “
LUK.2.25	Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout [carefully observing the divine Law], and looking for the 
LUK.2.26	It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord’s Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed). 
LUK.2.27	Prompted by the Spirit, he came into the temple [enclosure]; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, 
LUK.2.28	Simeon took Him into his arms, and blessed 
LUK.2.29	“Now, Lord, You are releasing Your bond-servant to leave [this world] in peace,
LUK.2.29	According to Your word;
LUK.2.30	For my eyes have seen Your Salvation,
LUK.2.31	Which You have prepared in the presence of all peoples,
LUK.2.32	A L
LUK.2.32	And [to bring] the praise 
LUK.2.33	And His [legal] father and His mother were amazed at what was said about Him. 
LUK.2.34	Simeon blessed them and said to Mary His mother, “Listen carefully: this 
LUK.2.35	and a sword [of deep sorrow] will pierce through your own soul—so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.”
LUK.2.36	There was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old, and had lived with her husband for seven years after her marriage, 
LUK.2.37	and then as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She did not leave the [area of the] temple, but was serving 
LUK.2.38	She, too, came up at that very moment and 
LUK.2.39	And when they had done everything [in connection with Jesus’ birth] according to the Law of the Lord, they went back to Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth. 
LUK.2.40	And the Child continued to grow and become strong [in spirit], filled with wisdom; and the grace (favor, spiritual blessing) of God was upon Him.
LUK.2.41	Now His parents went to Jerusalem every year for the Passover Feast. 
LUK.2.42	And when He was twelve years old, they went up 
LUK.2.43	and as they were returning [to 
LUK.2.44	but supposed Him to be in the caravan, and traveled a day’s journey; and [then] they 
LUK.2.45	When they did not find Him, they went back to Jerusalem looking for Him [everywhere]. 
LUK.2.46	Three days later they found Him in the [court of the] temple, sitting among the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions. 
LUK.2.47	All who heard Him were amazed by His intelligence 
LUK.2.48	When they saw Him, they were overwhelmed; and His mother said to Him, “Son, why have You treated us like this? Listen, Your 
LUK.2.49	And He answered, 
LUK.2.50	But they did not understand what He had said to them. 
LUK.2.51	He went down to Nazareth with them, and was continually submissive 
LUK.2.52	And Jesus kept increasing in wisdom and in stature, and in favor with God and men.
LUK.3.1	Now in the fifteenth year of [Emperor] 
LUK.3.2	in the high 
LUK.3.3	And he went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sin; 
LUK.3.4	as it is written 
LUK.3.4	“T
LUK.3.4	‘P
LUK.3.5	E
LUK.3.5	A
LUK.3.5	A
LUK.3.5	A
LUK.3.7	So he 
LUK.3.8	Therefore produce fruit that is worthy of [and consistent with your] repentance [that is, live changed lives, turn from sin and seek God and His righteousness]. And do not 
LUK.3.9	Even now the axe [of God’s judgment] is swinging toward the root of the trees; so every tree that does not produce good fruit is being cut down and thrown into the fire.”
LUK.3.10	The crowds asked him, “Then what are we to do?” 
LUK.3.11	And John replied, “The man who has two tunics is to share with him who has none; and he who has food is to do the same.” 
LUK.3.12	Even 
LUK.3.13	And he told them, “Collect no more than the 
LUK.3.14	 soldiers asked him, “And 
LUK.3.15	Now the people were in a state of expectation, and all were wondering in their hearts about John, as to whether he was the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed). 
LUK.3.16	John answered them all by saying, “As for me, I baptize you [only] 
LUK.3.17	His 
LUK.3.18	So with many other appeals 
LUK.3.19	But when Herod [Antipas] the tetrarch was 
LUK.3.20	he also added this to them all: he locked up John in prison.
LUK.3.21	Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus was also baptized, and while He was praying, the [visible] heaven was opened, 
LUK.3.22	and the 
LUK.3.23	When He began His ministry, Jesus Himself was about thirty years of age, being, as was supposed, the son of Joseph, the son [by marriage] of Eli, 
LUK.3.24	the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph, 
LUK.3.25	the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Hesli, the son of Naggai, 
LUK.3.26	the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda, 
LUK.3.27	the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri, 
LUK.3.28	the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er, 
LUK.3.29	the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, 
LUK.3.30	the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim, 
LUK.3.31	the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David, 
LUK.3.32	the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon, 
LUK.3.33	the son of Amminadab, the son of Admin, the son of Ram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah, 
LUK.3.34	the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor, 
LUK.3.35	the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Heber, the son of Shelah, 
LUK.3.36	the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, 
LUK.3.37	the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan, 
LUK.3.38	the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.
LUK.4.1	Now Jesus, full of [and in perfect communication with] the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness 
LUK.4.2	for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And He ate nothing during those days, and when they ended, He was hungry. 
LUK.4.3	Then the devil said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, command this stone to turn into bread.” 
LUK.4.4	Jesus replied to him, 
LUK.4.5	Then he led Jesus up [to a high mountain] and displayed before Him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth [and their magnificence] in the twinkling of an eye. 
LUK.4.6	And the devil said to Him, “I will give You all this realm and its glory [its power, its renown]; because it has been handed over to me, and I give it to whomever I wish. 
LUK.4.7	Therefore if You worship before me, it will all be Yours.” 
LUK.4.8	Jesus replied to him, 
LUK.4.9	Then he led Jesus to Jerusalem and had Him stand on the pinnacle (highest point) of the temple, and said [mockingly] to Him, “If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here; 
LUK.4.10	for it is written 
LUK.4.10	‘H
LUK.4.11	and,
LUK.4.11	‘
LUK.4.11	S
LUK.4.12	Jesus replied to him, 
LUK.4.13	When the devil had finished every temptation, he [temporarily] left Him until a more opportune time.
LUK.4.14	Then Jesus went back to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and the news about Him spread through the entire region. 
LUK.4.15	And He 
LUK.4.16	So He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up; and as was His custom, He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath, and stood up to read. 
LUK.4.17	The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written,
LUK.4.20	Then He rolled up the scroll [having stopped in the middle of the verse], gave it back to the attendant and sat down [to teach]; and the eyes of all those in the synagogue were [attentively] fixed on Him. 
LUK.4.21	He began speaking to them: 
LUK.4.22	And [as He continued on] they all were speaking well of Him, and were in awe 
LUK.4.23	So He said to them, 
LUK.4.24	Then He said, 
LUK.4.26	 [by the Lord] 
LUK.4.27	 [by being healed] 
LUK.4.28	As they heard these things [about God’s grace to these two Gentiles], 
LUK.4.29	and they got up and drove Him out of the city, and led Him to the crest of the hill on which their city had been built, in order to hurl Him down the cliff. 
LUK.4.30	But passing [miraculously] through the crowd, He went on His way.
LUK.4.31	Then He came down [from the hills of Nazareth] to Capernaum, a city of Galilee [on the shore of the sea], and He was teaching them on the Sabbath; 
LUK.4.32	and they were surprised [almost overwhelmed] at His teaching, because His message was [given] with authority 
LUK.4.33	There was a man in the synagogue who was possessed by the spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud 
LUK.4.34	“Let us alone! 
LUK.4.35	But Jesus rebuked him, saying, 
LUK.4.36	They were all astonished 
LUK.4.37	And the news about Him spread into every place in the surrounding district (Galilee).
LUK.4.38	Then Jesus got up and left the synagogue and went to Simon’s (Peter’s) house. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Him to help her. 
LUK.4.39	Standing over her, He rebuked the fever, and it left her; and immediately she got up and 
LUK.4.40	While the sun was setting [marking the end of the Sabbath day], all those who had any 
LUK.4.41	Demons also were coming out of many people, shouting, “You are the Son of God!” But He rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that He was the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed).
LUK.4.42	When daybreak came, Jesus left [Simon Peter’s house] and went to a secluded place; and the crowds were searching for Him, and [they] came to Him and tried to keep Him from leaving them. 
LUK.4.43	But He said, 
LUK.4.44	So He continued preaching in the synagogues of Judea [the country of the Jews, including Galilee].
LUK.5.1	Now it happened that while Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret (Sea of Galilee), with the people crowding all around Him and listening to the word of God; 
LUK.5.2	that He saw two boats lying at the edge of the lake, but the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets. 
LUK.5.3	He got into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little distance from the shore. And He sat down and 
LUK.5.4	When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon [Peter], 
LUK.5.5	Simon replied, “Master, we worked hard all night [to the point of exhaustion] and caught nothing [in our nets], but at Your word I will [do as you say and] lower the nets [again].” 
LUK.5.6	When they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their nets were [at the point of] breaking; 
LUK.5.7	so they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both of the boats [with fish], so that they began to sink. 
LUK.5.8	But when Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Go away from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!” 
LUK.5.9	For he and all his companions were completely astounded at the catch of fish which they had taken; 
LUK.5.10	and so were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon [Peter]. Jesus said to Simon, 
LUK.5.11	After they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and 
LUK.5.12	While Jesus was in one of the cities, there came a man covered with [an advanced case of] leprosy; and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean 
LUK.5.13	And Jesus reached out His hand and touched him, saying, 
LUK.5.14	Jesus ordered him to tell no one [that he might happen to meet], 
LUK.5.15	But the news about Him was spreading farther, and large crowds kept gathering to hear Him and to be healed of their illnesses. 
LUK.5.16	But Jesus Himself would often slip away to the wilderness and pray [in seclusion].
LUK.5.17	One day as He was teaching, there were Pharisees and teachers of the Law sitting there who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was 
LUK.5.18	 men came carrying on a stretcher a man who was paralyzed, and they tried to bring him in and lay him down in front of Jesus. 
LUK.5.19	But finding no way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up on the 
LUK.5.20	When Jesus saw their [active] faith [springing from confidence in Him], He said, 
LUK.5.21	The scribes and the Pharisees began to consider 
LUK.5.22	But Jesus, knowing their [hostile] thoughts, answered them, 
LUK.5.24	—He said to the paralyzed man, 
LUK.5.25	He immediately stood up before them, picked up his stretcher, and went home glorifying 
LUK.5.26	They were all astonished, and they 
LUK.5.27	After this Jesus went out and noticed a tax collector named Levi (Matthew) sitting at the tax booth; and He said to him, 
LUK.5.28	And he left everything behind and got up and 
LUK.5.29	Levi (Matthew) gave a great banquet for Him at his house; and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining 
LUK.5.30	The Pharisees and their scribes [seeing those with whom He was associating] 
LUK.5.31	And Jesus replied to them, 
LUK.5.32	 [self-proclaimed] 
LUK.5.33	Then they said to Him, “The disciples of John [the Baptist] often practice fasting and offer prayers [of special petition], and so do the 
LUK.5.34	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.5.35	 [for mourning] 
LUK.5.36	He also told them a parable: 
LUK.5.37	 [fermenting] 
LUK.6.1	One Sabbath while Jesus was passing through fields of standing grain, it happened that His disciples were picking the heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands, and eating them. 
LUK.6.2	But some of the Pharisees said, “Why are you doing what 
LUK.6.3	Jesus replied to them, 
LUK.6.4	 [for anyone] 
LUK.6.5	Jesus was saying to them, 
LUK.6.6	On another Sabbath He went into the synagogue and taught, and a man was present whose right hand was withered. 
LUK.6.7	The scribes and the Pharisees were watching Him closely [with malicious intent], to see if He would [actually] heal [someone] on the Sabbath, so that they might find 
LUK.6.8	But He was aware of their thoughts, and He said to the man with the withered hand, 
LUK.6.9	Then Jesus said to them, 
LUK.6.10	After looking around at them all, He said to the man, 
LUK.6.11	But the scribes and Pharisees were filled with senseless rage [and lacked spiritual insight], and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.
LUK.6.12	Now at this time Jesus went off to the mountain to pray, and He spent the whole night in prayer to God. 
LUK.6.13	When day came, He called His disciples and selected twelve of them, whom He also named 
LUK.6.14	Simon, whom He also named Peter, and his brother Andrew; and [the brothers] 
LUK.6.15	and Matthew (Levi, the tax collector) and Thomas; and 
LUK.6.16	Judas [also called Thaddaeus] 
LUK.6.17	Then Jesus came down with them and stood on a level place; and 
LUK.6.18	who had come to listen to Him and to be healed of their diseases. Even those who were troubled by unclean spirits (demons) were being healed. 
LUK.6.19	All the people were trying to touch Him, because [healing] power was coming from Him and healing them all.
LUK.6.20	And looking toward His disciples, He began 
LUK.6.21	 [joyful, nourished by God’s goodness] 
LUK.6.22	 [morally courageous and spiritually alive with life-joy in God’s goodness] 
LUK.6.23	 [absolutely inexhaustible]; 
LUK.6.24	 [and place your faith in possessions while remaining spiritually impoverished], 
LUK.6.25	 [enjoying a life of self-indulgence], 
LUK.6.29	 [simply ignore insignificant insults or losses and do not bother to retaliate—maintain your dignity]. 
LUK.6.32	 [only] 
LUK.6.34	 [money] 
LUK.6.35	 [that is, unselfishly seek the best or higher good for] 
LUK.6.36	 [heavenly] 
LUK.6.38	 [with no space left for more]. 
LUK.6.39	He also told them a parable: 
LUK.6.45	 [intrinsically] 
LUK.6.48	 [far-sighted, practical, and sensible] 
LUK.6.49	 [merely] 
LUK.7.1	After He had finished all that He had to say in the hearing of the people, He went to Capernaum.
LUK.7.2	Now a [Roman] 
LUK.7.3	When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to Him, asking Him to come and save the life of his slave. 
LUK.7.4	When they reached Jesus, they pleaded with Him earnestly [to come], saying, “He is worthy for You to do this for him, 
LUK.7.5	because he loves our nation and he built us our synagogue [at his own expense].” 
LUK.7.6	And Jesus went with them. But when He was near the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying, “Lord, do not trouble Yourself further, for I am not worthy for You to come under my roof. 
LUK.7.7	Therefore I did not even consider myself worthy to come to You. But just speak a word, and my slave will be healed. 
LUK.7.8	For I also am a man subject to authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” 
LUK.7.9	Now when Jesus heard this, He was amazed at him, and turned and said to the crowd that was following Him, 
LUK.7.10	When the messengers who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave in good health.
LUK.7.11	Soon afterward Jesus went to a city called Nain [near Nazareth], and His disciples and a large crowd accompanied Him. 
LUK.7.12	Now as He approached the city gate, a dead man was being carried out—the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the city was with her [in the funeral procession]. 
LUK.7.13	When the Lord saw her, He felt [great] compassion for her, and said to her, 
LUK.7.14	And He came up and touched the bier [on which the body rested], and the pallbearers stood still. And He said, 
LUK.7.15	The man who was dead sat up and began to speak. And 
LUK.7.16	Fear 
LUK.7.17	This news about Him spread through all of Judea and in all the surrounding countryside.
LUK.7.18	John’s disciples brought word to him [in prison] of all these things. 
LUK.7.19	John called two of his disciples and sent them to the Lord, saying, “Are You the 
LUK.7.20	So the men came to Jesus and said, “John the Baptist sent us to You to ask, ‘Are You the Expected One (the Messiah), or should we look for someone else?’ ” 
LUK.7.21	At that very hour Jesus healed many 
LUK.7.22	So He replied to them, 
LUK.7.23	 [joyful, spiritually favored] 
LUK.7.24	When John’s messengers left, Jesus began speaking to the crowds about John: 
LUK.7.25	 [entirely unsuited for the harsh wilderness]? 
LUK.7.26	 [really] 
LUK.7.27	 [by the prophet Malachi],
LUK.7.27	‘
LUK.7.29	All the people and the tax collectors who heard Jesus, acknowledged [the validity of] God’s justice, having been baptized with the baptism of John. 
LUK.7.30	But the Pharisees and the lawyers [who were experts in the Mosaic Law] annulled 
LUK.7.32	 [pretending to be at a wedding], 
LUK.7.34	 [heavy] 
LUK.7.35	 [by the lifestyle, moral character, and good deeds of her followers].”
LUK.7.36	One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to eat with him, and He went into the Pharisee’s house [in the region of Galilee] and reclined 
LUK.7.37	Now there was a woman in the city who was [known as] a 
LUK.7.38	and standing behind Him at His feet, weeping, she began wetting His feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and [respectfully] kissed His feet [as an act signifying both affection and submission] and 
LUK.7.39	Now when [Simon] the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he said to himself, “If this Man were a prophet He would know who and what sort of woman this is who is touching Him, that she is a [notorious] sinner [an outcast, devoted to sin].”
LUK.7.40	Jesus, answering, said to the Pharisee, 
LUK.7.42	 [the debts], 
LUK.7.43	Simon answered, “The one, I take it, for whom he forgave more.” Jesus said to him, 
LUK.7.44	Then turning toward the woman, He said to Simon, 
LUK.7.45	 [welcoming] 
LUK.7.46	 [even] 
LUK.7.48	Then He said to her, 
LUK.7.49	Those who were reclining 
LUK.7.50	Jesus said to the woman, 
LUK.8.1	Soon afterward, Jesus 
LUK.8.2	and 
LUK.8.3	and Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod’s household steward, and Susanna, and many others who were contributing to their support out of their private means [as was the custom for a rabbi’s disciples].
LUK.8.4	When a large crowd was gathering together, and people from city after city were coming to Him, He spoke [to them] using a parable: 
LUK.8.6	 [shallow soil covering] 
LUK.8.8	 As He said these things, He called out, 
LUK.8.9	Now His disciples 
LUK.8.10	And He said, 
LUK.8.12	 [of God] 
LUK.8.13	 [from Me and abandon their faith]. 
LUK.8.18	 [a teachable heart], 
LUK.8.19	Then Jesus’ mother and His brothers came up toward Him, but they could not reach Him because of the crowd. 
LUK.8.20	And He was told, “Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, asking to see You.” 
LUK.8.21	But He answered, 
LUK.8.22	Now on one of 
LUK.8.23	But as they were sailing, He fell asleep. And a fierce gale of wind swept down [as if through a wind tunnel] on the lake, and they 
LUK.8.24	They came to Jesus and woke Him, saying, “Master, Master, we are about to die!” He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging, violent waves, and they ceased, and it became calm [a perfect peacefulness]. 
LUK.8.25	And He said to them, 
LUK.8.26	Then they sailed to the 
LUK.8.27	Now when Jesus stepped out on land, He was met by a man from the city [of Gerasa] who was possessed with demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and was not living in a house, but among the 
LUK.8.28	Seeing Jesus, he cried out [with a terrible voice from the depths of his throat] and fell down before Him [in dread and terror], and shouted loudly, “
LUK.8.29	Now He was [already] commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had seized him [violently] many times; and he was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the desert. 
LUK.8.30	Then Jesus asked him, 
LUK.8.31	They 
LUK.8.32	Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the mountain. 
LUK.8.33	Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.
LUK.8.34	When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they ran away and told it in the city and out in the country. 
LUK.8.35	 came out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind (mentally healthy); and they were frightened. 
LUK.8.36	Those who had seen it told them how the man who had been demon-possessed had been healed. 
LUK.8.37	Then all the people of the country of the Gerasenes and the surrounding district asked Him to leave them, because they were overwhelmed with fear. So Jesus got into the boat and returned [to the west side of the Sea of Galilee]. 
LUK.8.38	But the man from whom the demons had gone out kept begging Him, pleading to go with Him; but Jesus sent him away, saying, 
LUK.8.39	 [about] 
LUK.8.40	Now as Jesus was returning [to Galilee], the people welcomed Him, for they had all been expecting Him. 
LUK.8.41	Now a man named Jairus, a synagogue official, came [to Him]; and he fell at Jesus’ feet and 
LUK.8.42	for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. But as Jesus went, the people were crowding against Him [almost crushing Him].
LUK.8.43	And a woman who had [suffered from] a hemorrhage for twelve years 
LUK.8.44	came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His outer robe, and immediately her bleeding stopped. 
LUK.8.45	Jesus said, 
LUK.8.46	But Jesus said, 
LUK.8.47	When the woman saw that she had not escaped notice, she came up trembling and fell down before Him. She declared in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched Him, and how she had been immediately healed. 
LUK.8.48	He said to her, 
LUK.8.49	While He was still speaking, someone from the synagogue official’s house came and said [to Jairus], “Your daughter is dead; do not inconvenience the Teacher any further.” 
LUK.8.50	But Jesus, hearing this, answered him, 
LUK.8.51	When He came to the house, He allowed no one to enter with Him, except Peter and John and James, and the girl’s father and mother. 
LUK.8.52	Now they were all weeping loudly and mourning for her; but He said, 
LUK.8.53	Then they 
LUK.8.54	But Jesus took hold of her hand and spoke, saying, 
LUK.8.55	And her spirit returned, and she got up immediately; and He ordered that she be given 
LUK.8.56	Her parents were greatly astonished [by the miracle]; but He instructed them to tell no one what had happened.
LUK.9.1	Now Jesus called together the twelve [disciples] and gave them [the right to exercise] power and authority over all the demons and to heal diseases. 
LUK.9.2	Then He sent them out [on a brief journey] to preach 
LUK.9.3	And He said to them, 
LUK.9.4	 [to go to another]. 
LUK.9.5	 [breaking all ties with them] 
LUK.9.6	So they 
LUK.9.7	Now Herod [Antipas] the tetrarch [who governed a portion of Palestine including Galilee and Perea] heard about all that was being done [by Jesus], and he was thoroughly perplexed, because it was said by some that John [the Baptist whom he had ordered beheaded] had been raised from the dead, 
LUK.9.8	and by others that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the [other] prophets of old had been resurrected. 
LUK.9.9	Herod said, “I personally had John beheaded. Who is this man about whom I hear such things?” And he kept trying to see Jesus.
LUK.9.10	When the apostles returned, they told Him all that they had done. He took them with Him and He privately withdrew [across the Jordan] to a city called Bethsaida. 
LUK.9.11	But when the crowds learned of it, they followed Him; and He welcomed them and He 
LUK.9.12	Now the day was ending, and the twelve [disciples] came and said to Him, “Send the crowd away, so that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside and find lodging, and get provisions; because here we are in an isolated place.” 
LUK.9.13	But He said to them, 
LUK.9.14	(For there were 
LUK.9.15	They did so, and had them all sit down. 
LUK.9.16	Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and He looked up to heaven [and gave thanks] and blessed them, and broke 
LUK.9.17	They all ate and were [completely] satisfied; and the broken pieces which they had left over were [abundant and were] picked up—twelve baskets full.
LUK.9.18	Now it happened that as Jesus was praying privately, the disciples were with Him, and He asked them, 
LUK.9.19	They answered, “John the Baptist, and some say, Elijah; but others, that one of the ancient prophets has come back to life.” 
LUK.9.20	And He said to them, 
LUK.9.21	But He strictly warned and admonished them not to tell this to anyone, 
LUK.9.22	saying, 
LUK.9.23	And He was saying to them all, 
LUK.9.24	 [in this world] 
LUK.9.25	 [wealth, fame, success], 
LUK.9.26	 [here and now] 
LUK.9.28	Now about eight days after these teachings, He took along Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray. 
LUK.9.29	As He was praying, the appearance of His face became different [actually transformed], and His clothing 
LUK.9.30	And behold, two men were talking with Him; and they were Moses and Elijah, 
LUK.9.31	who appeared in glory, and were speaking of His departure [from earthly life], which He was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem. 
LUK.9.32	Now Peter and those who were with him had been overcome with sleep; but when they were fully awake, they saw His glory 
LUK.9.33	And as these [men, Moses and Elijah] were leaving Him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is delightful 
LUK.9.34	But even as he was saying this, a cloud formed and 
LUK.9.35	Then 
LUK.9.36	When the voice had ceased, Jesus was found 
LUK.9.37	On the next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met Him. 
LUK.9.38	And a man from the crowd shouted for help, “Teacher, I beg You to look at my son, because he is my only child; 
LUK.9.39	and a spirit seizes him, and suddenly he cries out, and it throws him into a convulsion so that he foams 
LUK.9.40	I begged Your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.” 
LUK.9.41	Jesus answered, 
LUK.9.42	Even while the boy was coming, the demon slammed him down and threw him into a [violent] convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy and gave him back to his father. 
LUK.9.43	They were all amazed [practically overwhelmed] at the [evidence of the] greatness of God 
LUK.9.44	 [who are His enemies].” 
LUK.9.45	However, they did not understand this statement. Its meaning was kept hidden from them so that they would not grasp it; and they were afraid to ask Him about it.
LUK.9.46	An argument started among them as to which of them might be the greatest [surpassing the others in esteem and authority]. 
LUK.9.47	But Jesus, knowing what they were thinking in their heart, took a child and had him stand beside Him, 
LUK.9.48	and He told them, 
LUK.9.49	John replied, “Master, we saw someone driving out demons in Your name; and we tried to stop him because he does not follow along with us.” 
LUK.9.50	But Jesus told him, 
LUK.9.51	Now when the time was approaching for Him to be taken up [to heaven], He was determined to go to Jerusalem [to fulfill His purpose]. 
LUK.9.52	He sent messengers on ahead of Him, and they went into a Samaritan village to make arrangements for Him; 
LUK.9.53	but the people would not welcome Him, 
LUK.9.54	When His disciples James and John saw this, they said, “Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and destroy them?” 
LUK.9.55	But He turned and rebuked them 
LUK.9.56	 And they journeyed on to another village.
LUK.9.57	As they were going along the road, someone said to Him, “I will follow You wherever You go.” 
LUK.9.58	And Jesus told him, 
LUK.9.59	He said to another, 
LUK.9.60	But He said to him, 
LUK.9.61	Another also said, “I will follow You, Lord [as Your disciple]; but first let me say goodbye to those at my home.” 
LUK.9.62	But Jesus said to him, 
LUK.10.1	Now after this the Lord appointed 
LUK.10.2	He was saying to them, 
LUK.10.4	 [extra] 
LUK.10.5	 [that is, a blessing of well-being and prosperity, the favor of God] 
LUK.10.6	 [someone who is sweet-spirited and hospitable], 
LUK.10.9	 [authenticating your message], 
LUK.10.11	 [breaking all ties]; 
LUK.10.12	 [of judgment] 
LUK.10.17	The seventy returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name.” 
LUK.10.18	He said to them, 
LUK.10.19	 [that you now possess] 
LUK.10.21	In that very hour He was overjoyed 
LUK.10.23	Then turning to His disciples, Jesus said privately, 
LUK.10.25	And a certain lawyer [an expert in Mosaic Law] stood up to test Him, saying, “Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” 
LUK.10.26	Jesus said to him, 
LUK.10.27	And he replied, “Y
LUK.10.28	Jesus said to him, 
LUK.10.29	But he, wishing to justify 
LUK.10.30	Jesus replied, 
LUK.10.32	 [of the road]. 
LUK.10.33	 [for him], 
LUK.10.34	 [to sooth and disinfect the injuries]; 
LUK.10.37	He answered, “The one who showed compassion 
LUK.10.38	Now while they were on their way, Jesus entered a village [called Bethany], and a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home. 
LUK.10.39	She had a sister named Mary, who seated herself at the Lord’s feet and was 
LUK.10.40	But Martha was very busy 
LUK.10.41	But the Lord replied to her, 
LUK.10.42	 [that which is to her advantage], 
LUK.11.1	It happened that while Jesus was praying in a certain place, after He finished, one of His disciples said to Him, “Lord, teach us to pray just as John also taught his disciples.” 
LUK.11.2	He said to them,
LUK.11.5	Then He said to them, 
LUK.11.10	 [persistently], 
LUK.11.13	 [that is, sinful by nature], 
LUK.11.14	And [at another time] Jesus was casting out a demon, and it was [controlling a man so as to make him] mute; when the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke. And the crowds were awed. 
LUK.11.15	But some of them said, “He drives out demons by [the power of] 
LUK.11.16	Others, trying to test Him, were demanding of Him a sign from heaven. 
LUK.11.17	But He, 
LUK.11.18	 [the power of] 
LUK.11.19	 [the Jewish exorcists] 
LUK.11.22	 [goods as] 
LUK.11.23	 [believing in Me as Lord and Savior] 
LUK.11.26	 [the person] 
LUK.11.27	Now while Jesus was saying these things, one of the women in the crowd raised her voice and said to Him, “Blessed (happy, favored by God) is the womb that gave birth to You and the breasts at which You nursed!” 
LUK.11.28	But He said, 
LUK.11.29	Now as the crowds were increasing [in number], He began to say, 
LUK.11.30	 [a sign] 
LUK.11.32	 [as witnesses] 
LUK.11.34	 [spiritually perceptive, focused on God], 
LUK.11.36	 [with light], 
LUK.11.37	Now after Jesus had spoken, a Pharisee asked Him to have lunch with him. He went in [the Pharisee’s home] and reclined 
LUK.11.38	The Pharisee noticed this and was surprised that Jesus did not first ceremonially wash before the meal. 
LUK.11.39	But the Lord said to him, 
LUK.11.40	 [acting without reflection or intelligence]! 
LUK.11.41	 [that is, acts of mercy and compassion, not as a public display, but as an expression of your faithfulness to God], 
LUK.11.44	 [and are ceremonially unclean].”
LUK.11.45	One of the lawyers [an expert in the Mosaic Law] answered Him, “Teacher, by saying this, You insult us too!” 
LUK.11.46	But He said, 
LUK.11.48	 [actually] 
LUK.11.49	 [in the Scriptures], 
LUK.11.50	 [holding them responsible] 
LUK.11.51	 [the priest], 
LUK.11.52	 [by your flawed interpretation of God’s word and your man-made tradition].”
LUK.11.53	When He left there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be very hostile [toward Him] and to interrogate Him on many subjects, 
LUK.11.54	plotting against Him to catch 
LUK.12.1	In the meantime, after so many thousands of the people had gathered that they were stepping on one another, Jesus began speaking first 
LUK.12.2	 [so carefully] 
LUK.12.5	 [you] 
LUK.12.6	 [ever] 
LUK.12.10	 [that is, whoever intentionally discredits the Holy Spirit by attributing the authenticating miracles done by Me to Satan], 
LUK.12.13	Someone from the crowd said to Him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the 
LUK.12.14	But He said to him, 
LUK.12.15	Then He said to them, 
LUK.12.16	Then He told them a parable, saying, 
LUK.12.17	 [large enough in which] 
LUK.12.19	 [enough] 
LUK.12.21	 [in his relationship] 
LUK.12.22	Jesus said to His disciples, 
LUK.12.24	 [seed] 
LUK.12.26	 [such as that], 
LUK.12.27	 [in the open field]. 
LUK.12.30	 [pagan] 
LUK.12.31	 [strive for and actively] 
LUK.12.38	 [prepared and ready], 
LUK.12.41	Peter said, “Lord, are You addressing this parable to us [disciples], or to everyone else as well?”
LUK.12.42	The Lord said, 
LUK.12.47	 [of the whip], 
LUK.12.48	 [lashes]. 
LUK.12.50	 [of great suffering] 
LUK.12.51	 [between believers and unbelievers]; 
LUK.12.52	 [over Me], 
LUK.12.54	He also said to the crowds, 
LUK.12.55	 [you see that] 
LUK.12.56	 [to forecast the weather], 
LUK.12.58	 [at law] 
LUK.12.59	 [absolutely] 
LUK.13.1	Just at that time some people came who told Jesus about the 
LUK.13.2	Jesus replied to them, 
LUK.13.3	 [change your old way of thinking, turn from your sinful ways and live changed lives], 
LUK.13.5	 [change your old way of thinking, turn from your sinful ways and live changed lives], 
LUK.13.6	Then He 
LUK.13.7	 [depleting the soil and blocking the sunlight]?’ 
LUK.13.8	 [just] 
LUK.13.10	Now Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath. 
LUK.13.11	And there was a woman who for eighteen years had had an illness caused by a spirit (demon). She was bent double, and could not straighten up at all. 
LUK.13.12	When Jesus saw her, He called her over and said to her, 
LUK.13.13	Then He laid His hands on her; and immediately she stood erect again and she 
LUK.13.14	But the leader of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, 
LUK.13.15	But the Lord replied to him, 
LUK.13.17	As He was saying this, all His opponents were being humiliated; and the entire crowd was rejoicing over all the glorious things that were being done by Him.
LUK.13.18	So this led Him to say, 
LUK.13.20	And again He said, 
LUK.13.22	Jesus journeyed on through cities and villages, teaching and making His way toward Jerusalem. 
LUK.13.23	And someone asked Him, “Lord, will only a few be saved [from the penalties of the last judgment]?” And He said to them, 
LUK.13.24	 [force aside unbelief and the attractions of sin]; 
LUK.13.25	 [again and again], 
LUK.13.28	 [in sorrow and pain] 
LUK.13.29	 [and feast at the table] 
LUK.13.31	At that very hour some Pharisees came up and said to Him, “Leave and go away from here, because Herod [Antipas] wants to kill You.” 
LUK.13.32	And He said to them, 
LUK.13.34	 [to death] 
LUK.13.35	 [abandoned by God and destitute of His protection]; 
LUK.14.1	It happened one Sabbath, when He went for a meal at the house of one of the ruling Pharisees, that they were watching Him closely 
LUK.14.2	And there in front of Him was a man who had 
LUK.14.3	And Jesus asked the lawyers and the Pharisees, 
LUK.14.4	But they kept silent. Then He took hold of the man and healed him, and sent him on his way. 
LUK.14.5	Then He said to them, 
LUK.14.6	And they were unable to reply to this.
LUK.14.7	Now Jesus 
LUK.14.8	 [to eat] 
LUK.14.10	 [to eat] 
LUK.14.11	 [before others], 
LUK.14.12	Jesus also went on to say to the one who had invited Him, 
LUK.14.15	When one of those who were reclining 
LUK.14.16	But Jesus said to him, 
LUK.14.20	 [recently] 
LUK.14.21	 [his master,] 
LUK.14.22	 [after returning] 
LUK.14.23	 [with guests]. 
LUK.14.24	 [and declined] 
LUK.14.25	Now large crowds were going along with Jesus; and He turned and said to them, 
LUK.14.26	 [in the sense of indifference to or relative disregard for them in comparison with his attitude toward God]—
LUK.14.27	 [expressing a willingness to endure whatever may come] 
LUK.14.28	 [for his guards], 
LUK.14.29	 [the building], 
LUK.14.32	 [if he feels he is not powerful enough], 
LUK.14.33	 [carefully consider the cost and then for My sake] 
LUK.15.1	Now all the tax collectors and sinners [including non-observant Jews] were coming near Jesus to listen to Him. 
LUK.15.2	Both the Pharisees and the scribes 
LUK.15.3	So He told them this parable: 
LUK.15.4	 [searching] 
LUK.15.9	 [women] 
LUK.15.10	 [that is, changes his inner self—his old way of thinking, regrets past sins, lives his life in a way that proves repentance; and seeks God’s purpose for his life].”
LUK.15.11	Then He said, 
LUK.15.12	 [inappropriately] 
LUK.15.13	 [that he had] 
LUK.15.16	 [carob] 
LUK.15.17	 [finally] 
LUK.15.19	 [just] 
LUK.15.22	 [for the guest of honor] 
LUK.15.23	 [invite everyone and] 
LUK.15.24	 [as good as] 
LUK.15.26	 [celebration] 
LUK.15.29	 [so much as] 
LUK.15.30	 [other] 
LUK.15.32	 [as good as] 
LUK.16.1	Now Jesus was also saying to the disciples, 
LUK.16.2	 [of my affairs], 
LUK.16.3	 [of the estate] 
LUK.16.4	 [who are my master’s debtors] 
LUK.16.6	 [olive] 
LUK.16.8	 [not for his misdeeds, but] 
LUK.16.9	 [learn from this], 
LUK.16.12	 [earthly wealth] 
LUK.16.13	 [that is, your earthly possessions or anything else you trust in and rely on instead of God].”
LUK.16.14	Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, were listening to all these things and were sneering 
LUK.16.15	So He said to them, 
LUK.16.21	 [eagerly] 
LUK.16.25	 [all the comforts and delights], 
LUK.16.26	 [people] 
LUK.16.27	 [Abraham], 
LUK.16.29	 [the Scriptures given by] 
LUK.16.30	 [they will change their old way of thinking and seek God and His righteousness].’ 
LUK.16.31	 [the messages of] 
LUK.17.1	Jesus said to His disciples, 
LUK.17.2	 [as large as one turned by a donkey] 
LUK.17.3	 [looking out for one another]! 
LUK.17.4	 [that is, give up resentment and consider the offense recalled and annulled].”
LUK.17.5	The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith [our ability to confidently trust in God and in His power].” 
LUK.17.6	And the Lord said, 
LUK.17.8	 [for service] 
LUK.17.10	 [undeserving of praise or a reward, for we have not gone beyond our obligation]; 
LUK.17.11	While Jesus was on the way to Jerusalem, He was passing [along the border] between Samaria and Galilee. 
LUK.17.12	As He entered a village, He was met by ten lepers who stood at a distance; 
LUK.17.13	and they raised their voices and called out, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!” 
LUK.17.14	When He saw them, He said to them, 
LUK.17.15	One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, glorifying 
LUK.17.16	and he lay face downward at Jesus’ feet, thanking Him [over and over]. He was a 
LUK.17.17	Then Jesus asked, 
LUK.17.19	Jesus said to him, 
LUK.17.20	Now having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, He replied, 
LUK.17.21	 [because of My presence].”
LUK.17.22	Then He said to the disciples, 
LUK.17.23	 [the Messiah is] 
LUK.17.24	 [visible] 
LUK.17.25	 [to be the Messiah] 
LUK.17.26	 [the second coming of] 
LUK.17.27	 [they were indifferent to God] 
LUK.17.28	 [carrying on business as usual, without regard for their sins]; 
LUK.17.29	 [very] 
LUK.17.31	 [and go inside] 
LUK.17.32	 [what happened to] 
LUK.17.33	 [eventually] 
LUK.17.34	 [when Messiah comes again] 
LUK.17.35	 [at the mill] 
LUK.17.37	And they asked Him, “Where, Lord?” He answered, 
LUK.18.1	Now Jesus was telling the disciples a parable to make the point that at all times they ought to pray and not give up 
LUK.18.2	saying, 
LUK.18.3	 [desperate] 
LUK.18.5	 [will be an intolerable annoyance and she] 
LUK.18.6	Then the Lord said, 
LUK.18.7	 [our just] 
LUK.18.8	 [this kind of persistent] 
LUK.18.9	He also told this parable to some people who trusted in themselves 
LUK.18.10	 [enclosure] 
LUK.18.11	 [ostentatiously] 
LUK.18.13	 [in humility and repentance], 
LUK.18.14	 [forgiven of the guilt of sin and placed in right standing with God] 
LUK.18.15	Now they were also bringing their babies to Him, so that He would touch 
LUK.18.16	But Jesus called them to Himself, saying [to the apostles], 
LUK.18.17	 [with faith and humility] 
LUK.18.18	A certain ruler asked Him, “Good Teacher [You who are essentially and morally good], what shall I do to inherit eternal life [that is, eternal salvation in the Messiah’s kingdom]?” 
LUK.18.19	Jesus said to him, 
LUK.18.21	He replied, “I have kept all these things from my youth.” 
LUK.18.22	When Jesus heard this, He said to him, 
LUK.18.23	But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich. 
LUK.18.24	Jesus looked at him and said, 
LUK.18.25	 [who places his faith in wealth or status] 
LUK.18.26	And those who heard it said, “
LUK.18.27	But He said, 
LUK.18.28	Peter said, “Look, we have left all [things—homes, families, businesses] and followed You.” 
LUK.18.29	And He said to them, 
LUK.18.31	Then taking the 
LUK.18.33	 [from the dead].” 
LUK.18.34	But the disciples understood none of these things [about the approaching death and resurrection of Jesus]. This statement was hidden from them, and they did not grasp the [meaning of the] things that were said [by Jesus].
LUK.18.35	As He was approaching Jericho [on His way to Jerusalem], it happened that a blind man was sitting beside the road begging. 
LUK.18.36	Now when he heard a crowd going by, he 
LUK.18.37	They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.” 
LUK.18.38	So he shouted out, saying, “Jesus, 
LUK.18.39	Those who were leading the way were sternly telling him to keep quiet; but he screamed all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” 
LUK.18.40	Then Jesus stopped and ordered that the blind man be led to Him; and when he came near, Jesus asked him, 
LUK.18.41	 He said, “Lord, let me regain my sight!” 
LUK.18.42	Jesus said to him, 
LUK.18.43	Immediately he regained his sight and 
LUK.19.1	Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through. 
LUK.19.2	And there was a man called Zaccheus; he was a chief tax collector [a superintendent to whom others reported], and he was rich. 
LUK.19.3	Zaccheus was trying to see who Jesus was, but he could not see 
LUK.19.4	So he ran on ahead [of the crowd] and climbed up in a sycamore tree in order to see Him, for He was about to pass through that way. 
LUK.19.5	When Jesus reached the place, He looked up and said to him, 
LUK.19.6	So Zaccheus hurried and came down, and welcomed Jesus with joy. 
LUK.19.7	When the people saw it, they all 
LUK.19.8	Zaccheus stopped and said to the Lord, “See, Lord, I am [now] giving half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone out of anything, I will give back four times as much.” 
LUK.19.9	Jesus said to him, 
LUK.19.11	While they were listening to these things, Jesus went on to tell a parable, because He was near Jerusalem, and they assumed that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately [as soon as He reached the city]. 
LUK.19.12	So He said, 
LUK.19.13	 [one apiece, each equal to about a hundred days’ wages] 
LUK.19.14	 [the residents of his new kingdom] 
LUK.19.17	 [now] 
LUK.19.20	 [for safekeeping]. 
LUK.19.21	 [always] 
LUK.19.22	 [really] 
LUK.19.23	 [at the very least] 
LUK.19.26	[Jesus explained,] 
LUK.19.27	[The king ended by saying,] 
LUK.19.28	After saying these things, Jesus went on ahead [of them], going up to Jerusalem.
LUK.19.29	When He approached Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, He sent two of the disciples, 
LUK.19.30	saying, 
LUK.19.32	So those who were sent left and found the colt just as He had told them. 
LUK.19.33	As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, “Why are you untying the colt?” 
LUK.19.34	They said, “The Lord needs it.” 
LUK.19.35	They brought it to Jesus, and 
LUK.19.36	As He rode along, people were spreading their coats on the road [as an act of homage before a king]. 
LUK.19.37	As soon as He was approaching [Jerusalem], near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the entire multitude of the disciples [all those who were or claimed to be His followers] began praising God [adoring Him enthusiastically and] joyfully with loud voices for all the miracles 
LUK.19.38	shouting,
LUK.19.38	“B
LUK.19.38	Peace in heaven and glory (majesty, splendor) in the highest [heaven]!”
LUK.19.39	Some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to Him, “Teacher, rebuke Your disciples [for shouting these Messianic praises].” 
LUK.19.40	Jesus replied, 
LUK.19.41	As He approached 
LUK.19.42	saying, 
LUK.19.43	 [of siege] 
LUK.19.44	 [Jerusalem] 
LUK.19.45	Jesus went into the temple [enclosure] and began driving out those who were selling, 
LUK.19.46	saying to them, 
LUK.19.47	He was teaching day after day in the temple [porches and courts]; but the chief priests and scribes and the leading men among the people were seeking [a way] to put Him to death, 
LUK.19.48	and they could not find anything that they could do, for all the people [stayed close to Him and] were hanging on to 
LUK.20.1	On one of the days, as Jesus was instructing the people in the temple [area] and preaching the good news (gospel), 
LUK.20.2	and said to Him, “Tell us by what 
LUK.20.3	Jesus replied, 
LUK.20.4	 [the Baptist]—
LUK.20.5	They discussed 
LUK.20.6	But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us to death, for they are 
LUK.20.7	So they replied that they did not know from where 
LUK.20.8	Then Jesus said to them, 
LUK.20.9	Then He began to tell the people this parable: 
LUK.20.10	 [as his representative] 
LUK.20.12	 [of the vineyard]. 
LUK.20.14	 [man] 
LUK.20.16	 When the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders heard this, they said, “May it never be!” 
LUK.20.17	But Jesus looked at them and said, 
LUK.20.19	The scribes and the chief priests tried to [find a way to] arrest Him at that very hour, but they were afraid of the people; because they understood that He spoke this parable against them. 
LUK.20.20	So they watched [for a chance to trap] Him. They sent spies who pretended to be upright 
LUK.20.21	They asked Him, “Teacher, we know that You speak and teach correctly, and that You show no partiality to anyone, but teach the way of God truthfully. 
LUK.20.22	Is it lawful [according to Jewish law and tradition] for us to pay taxes (tribute money) to 
LUK.20.23	But He saw through their trickery and said to them, 
LUK.20.24	 [Roman] 
LUK.20.25	He said to them, 
LUK.20.26	They were not able to seize on anything He said in the presence of the people; and being unnerved at His reply, they were silent.
LUK.20.27	Now some of the Sadducees (who say that there is no resurrection) came to Him 
LUK.20.28	and they questioned Him, saying, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us [a law that] 
LUK.20.29	Now there were seven brothers; and the first took a wife and died childless. 
LUK.20.30	And the second, 
LUK.20.31	and the third married her, and in the same way all seven died, leaving no children. 
LUK.20.32	Finally the woman also died. 
LUK.20.33	So in the [life after] resurrection, whose wife does she become? For all seven had married her.”
LUK.20.34	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.20.35	 [other world and that future] 
LUK.20.36	 [immortal] 
LUK.20.37	 [as for the fact] 
LUK.20.38	 [so these forefathers will be among the resurrected]; 
LUK.20.39	Some of the scribes replied, “Teacher, you have spoken well [so that there is no room for blame].” 
LUK.20.40	And they did not dare to question Him further about anything [because of the wisdom He displayed in His answers].
LUK.20.41	Then He said to them, 
LUK.20.45	And with all the people listening, He said to His disciples, 
LUK.20.46	 [displaying their prominence], 
LUK.20.47	 [men] 
LUK.21.1	Looking up, He saw the rich people putting their gifts into the treasury. 
LUK.21.2	And He saw a poor widow putting in two 
LUK.21.3	He said, 
LUK.21.5	As some were talking about the 
LUK.21.7	They asked Him, “Teacher, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign when these things are about to happen?” 
LUK.21.8	He said, 
LUK.21.9	 [civil unrest, revolts, uprisings], 
LUK.21.10	Then Jesus told them, 
LUK.21.11	 [deadly and devastating] 
LUK.21.13	 [about Me]. 
LUK.21.15	 [skillful] 
LUK.21.17	 [your association with] 
LUK.21.19	 [patient] 
LUK.21.21	 [out] 
LUK.21.22	 [of rendering full justice or satisfaction], 
LUK.21.23	 [Israel]. 
LUK.21.26	 [dreadful] 
LUK.21.27	 [transcendent, overwhelming] 
LUK.21.28	 [in joy], 
LUK.21.29	Then He told them a parable: 
LUK.21.31	 [without any doubt] 
LUK.21.32	 [those living at that definite period of time preceding the second coming] 
LUK.21.36	 [be attentive and ready], 
LUK.21.37	Now in the daytime Jesus was teaching in [the porches and courts of] the temple, but at night He would go out and spend the night on the mount that is called Olivet. 
LUK.21.38	And early in the morning all the people would come to Him in the temple to listen to Him.
LUK.22.1	Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching. 
LUK.22.2	The chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to put Him to death; for they were afraid of the people [who listened devotedly to His teaching, and who respected His spiritual wisdom].
LUK.22.3	Then Satan entered Judas, the one called Iscariot, who was one of the twelve [disciples]. 
LUK.22.4	And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers how he might betray Him 
LUK.22.5	They were delighted and agreed with him to give him money. 
LUK.22.6	So he consented, and 
LUK.22.7	Then came the 
LUK.22.8	So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, 
LUK.22.9	They asked Him, “Where do You want us to prepare it?” 
LUK.22.10	He replied, 
LUK.22.12	 [with carpets and dining couches]; 
LUK.22.13	They left and found it just as He had told them; and they prepared the Passover.
LUK.22.14	When the hour [for the meal] had come, Jesus reclined 
LUK.22.15	He said to them, 
LUK.22.17	And when He had taken a cup and 
LUK.22.19	And when He had taken bread and given thanks, He broke it and gave it to them, saying, 
LUK.22.20	And in the same way 
LUK.22.23	And they began to discuss among themselves which one of them it might be who was going to do this.
LUK.22.24	Now a dispute also arose among them as to which of them was regarded to be the greatest. 
LUK.22.25	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.22.26	 [and least privileged], 
LUK.22.29	 [the privilege] 
LUK.22.32	 [especially] 
LUK.22.33	And Peter said to Him, “Lord, I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death!” 
LUK.22.34	Jesus said, 
LUK.22.35	And He said to them, 
LUK.22.36	Then He said to them, 
LUK.22.37	 [Scripture] 
LUK.22.38	They said, “Lord, look, here are two swords.” And He said to them, 
LUK.22.39	And He came out and went, as was His habit, to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples followed Him. 
LUK.22.40	When He arrived at the place [called Gethsemane], He said to them, 
LUK.22.41	And He withdrew from them about a stone’s throw, and knelt down and prayed, 
LUK.22.42	saying, 
LUK.22.43	Now an angel appeared to Him from heaven, strengthening Him. 
LUK.22.44	And being in agony [deeply distressed and anguished; almost to the point of death], He prayed more intently; and His 
LUK.22.45	When He rose from prayer, He came to the disciples and found them sleeping from sorrow, 
LUK.22.46	and He said to them, 
LUK.22.47	While He was still speaking, a crowd 
LUK.22.48	And Jesus said to him, 
LUK.22.49	When those who were around Him saw what was about to happen, they said, “Lord, should we strike with the sword?” 
LUK.22.50	And 
LUK.22.51	But Jesus replied, 
LUK.22.52	Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders [of the Sanhedrin] who had come out against Him, 
LUK.22.54	Then they seized Him, and led Him 
LUK.22.55	After they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat among them. 
LUK.22.56	And a servant-girl, seeing him as he sat in the firelight and looking intently at him, said, “This man was with Him too.” 
LUK.22.57	But Peter denied it, saying, “Woman, I do not know Him!” 
LUK.22.58	A little later someone else saw him and said, “You are one of them too.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not!” 
LUK.22.59	After about an hour had passed, another man 
LUK.22.60	But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are talking about.” Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. 
LUK.22.61	The Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had told him, 
LUK.22.62	And he went out and wept bitterly [deeply grieved and distressed].
LUK.22.63	Now the men who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking 
LUK.22.64	They blindfolded Him and asked, “Prophesy, who is it that struck You?” 
LUK.22.65	And they were saying many other [evil and slanderous] things against Him, blaspheming [speaking sacrilegiously and abusively about] Him.
LUK.22.66	When day came, the Council of the elders of the people (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court) assembled, both chief priests and scribes; and they led Jesus away to the council 
LUK.22.67	“If You are the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed), tell us.” But He said to them, 
LUK.22.70	And they all said, “Are You the Son of God, then?” He replied, 
LUK.22.71	Then they asked, “What further need of testimony do we have? For we ourselves have heard it from His own mouth.”
LUK.23.1	Then the whole assembly got up and brought Him before Pilate. 
LUK.23.2	They began to accuse Jesus, asserting, “We found this Man misleading 
LUK.23.3	So Pilate asked Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” And He answered him, 
LUK.23.4	Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no guilt in this Man.” 
LUK.23.5	But they were insistent and said, “He stirs up the people [to rebel], teaching throughout Judea, starting from Galilee even as far as here [in Jerusalem].”
LUK.23.6	When Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man was a Galilean. 
LUK.23.7	And when he learned that He belonged to the jurisdiction of 
LUK.23.8	When Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly pleased. He had wanted to see Him for a long time because of what he had heard about Him, and was hoping to see some [miraculous] sign [even something spectacular] done by Him. 
LUK.23.9	And he questioned Him at some length, but Jesus made no reply. 
LUK.23.10	The chief priests and the scribes were standing there, 
LUK.23.11	And Herod with his soldiers, after treating Him with contempt and mocking 
LUK.23.12	Now that very day Herod and Pilate became friends with each other—before this they had been enemies.
LUK.23.13	Pilate summoned the chief priests and the rulers and the people, 
LUK.23.14	and said to them, “You brought this man before me as one who corrupts 
LUK.23.15	No, nor has Herod, for he sent Him back to us; and indeed, He has done nothing to deserve death. 
LUK.23.16	Therefore I will punish Him [to teach Him a lesson] and release Him.” 
LUK.23.17	Now he was obligated to release to them one prisoner at the Feast.
LUK.23.18	But they [loudly] shouted out all together, saying, “Away with this Man, and release Barabbas to us!” 
LUK.23.19	(He was one who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection that happened in the city, and for murder.) 
LUK.23.20	Pilate addressed them again, wanting to release Jesus, 
LUK.23.21	but they kept shouting out, “Crucify, crucify Him!” 
LUK.23.22	A third time he said to them, “Why, what wrong has He done? I have found no guilt [no crime, no offense] in Him 
LUK.23.23	But they were insistent 
LUK.23.24	Pilate pronounced sentence that their demand be granted. 
LUK.23.25	And he released the man they were asking for who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, but he handed over Jesus to their will.
LUK.23.26	When they led Him away, they seized a man, 
LUK.23.27	Following Him was a large crowd of the people, including women who were mourning and wailing for Him. 
LUK.23.28	But Jesus, turning toward them, said, 
LUK.23.32	Two others also, who were criminals, were being led away to be executed with Him.
LUK.23.33	When they came to the place called 
LUK.23.34	And Jesus was saying, 
LUK.23.35	Now the people stood by, watching; but even the rulers ridiculed 
LUK.23.36	The soldiers also mocked Him, coming up to Him and [cruelly] offering Him sour wine, 
LUK.23.37	and sarcastically saying, “If you are [really] the King of the Jews, save Yourself [from death]!” 
LUK.23.38	Now there was also an inscription above Him: “THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.”
LUK.23.39	One of the criminals who had been hanged [on a cross beside Him] kept hurling abuse at Him, saying, “Are You not the Christ? Save Yourself and us [from death]!” 
LUK.23.40	But the other one rebuked him, saying, “Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? 
LUK.23.41	We 
LUK.23.42	And he was saying, “Jesus, [please] remember me when You come into Your kingdom!” 
LUK.23.43	Jesus said to him, 
LUK.23.44	It was now about the sixth hour (noon), and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour (3:00 p.m.), 
LUK.23.45	because the sun was 
LUK.23.46	And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, 
LUK.23.47	Now when the centurion saw what had taken place, he 
LUK.23.48	All the crowds who had gathered for this spectacle, when they saw what had happened, 
LUK.23.49	And all His acquaintances and the women who had accompanied Him from Galilee were standing at a distance, watching these things.
LUK.23.50	A man named Joseph, who was a member of the Council (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court), a good and honorable man 
LUK.23.51	(he had not consented to the Council’s plan and action) 
LUK.23.52	this man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 
LUK.23.53	And [after receiving permission] he took it down and wrapped it in a linen [burial] cloth and laid Him in a tomb cut into the rock, where no one had yet been laid. 
LUK.23.54	It was the day of preparation [for the Sabbath], and the Sabbath was dawning. 
LUK.23.55	Now the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed [closely], and saw the tomb and how His body was laid. 
LUK.23.56	Then they went back and prepared spices and ointments 
LUK.24.1	But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, the women went to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared [to finish anointing the body]. 
LUK.24.2	And they found the [large, circular] stone rolled back from the tomb, 
LUK.24.3	but when they went inside, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. 
LUK.24.4	While they were perplexed 
LUK.24.5	and as the women were terrified and were bowing their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why are you looking for the living One among the dead? 
LUK.24.6	He is not here, but has risen. Remember how He told you, while He was still in Galilee, 
LUK.24.7	saying that the Son of Man must be handed over to sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise [from death to life].” 
LUK.24.8	And they remembered His words, 
LUK.24.9	and after returning from the tomb, they reported all these things to the eleven [apostles] and to all the rest. 
LUK.24.10	Now they were Mary Magdalene and Joanna [the wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward] and Mary the 
LUK.24.11	But their report seemed to them like idle talk 
LUK.24.12	But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping [at the small entrance] and looking in, he saw only the linen 
LUK.24.13	And then, that very day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, which was about 
LUK.24.14	And they were talking with each other about all these things which had taken place. 
LUK.24.15	While they were talking and discussing it, Jesus Himself came up and 
LUK.24.16	But their eyes were [miraculously] prevented from recognizing Him. 
LUK.24.17	Then Jesus asked them, 
LUK.24.18	One 
LUK.24.19	He asked, 
LUK.24.20	and how the chief priests and our rulers handed Him over to be sentenced to death, and crucified Him. 
LUK.24.21	But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel 
LUK.24.22	And also some of the women among us shocked us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, 
LUK.24.23	and they did not find His body. Then they came back, saying that they had even seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive! 
LUK.24.24	Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just exactly as the women had said, but they did not see Him.” 
LUK.24.25	Then Jesus said to them, 
LUK.24.26	 [only then to] 
LUK.24.27	Then beginning with Moses and [throughout] all the [writings of the] prophets, He explained 
LUK.24.28	Then they approached the village where they were going, and He acted as if He were going farther. 
LUK.24.29	But they urged Him [not to go on], saying, “Stay with us, because it is almost evening, and the day has just about ended.” So He went inside to stay with them. 
LUK.24.30	And it happened that as He reclined 
LUK.24.31	Then their eyes were [suddenly] opened [by God] and they [clearly] recognized Him; and He vanished from their sight. 
LUK.24.32	They said to one another, “Were not our hearts burning within us while He was talking with us on the road and opening the Scriptures to us?” 
LUK.24.33	They got up that very hour and went back to Jerusalem, and found the eleven [apostles] gathered together and those who were with them, 
LUK.24.34	saying, “The Lord has really risen and has appeared to Simon [Peter]!” 
LUK.24.35	They 
LUK.24.36	While they were talking about this, Jesus Himself [suddenly] stood among them and said to them, 
LUK.24.37	But they were startled and terrified and thought that they were seeing a spirit. 
LUK.24.38	And He said, 
LUK.24.39	 [the marks in] 
LUK.24.40	After saying this, He showed them His hands and His feet. 
LUK.24.41	While they still did not believe it because of their joy and amazement, He asked them, 
LUK.24.42	They gave Him a piece of broiled fish, 
LUK.24.43	and He took it and ate it in front of them.
LUK.24.44	Then He said to them, 
LUK.24.45	Then He opened their minds to [help them] understand the Scriptures, 
LUK.24.46	and said, 
LUK.24.47	 [necessary] 
LUK.24.49	 [the Holy Spirit] 
LUK.24.50	Then He led them out as far as Bethany, and lifted up His hands and blessed them. 
LUK.24.51	While He was blessing them, He left them and was taken up into heaven. 
LUK.24.52	And they worshiped Him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy [fully understanding that He lives and that He is the Son of God]; 
LUK.24.53	and they were continually in the temple blessing 
JHN.1.1	In the beginning [before all time] was the Word (
JHN.1.2	He was [continually existing] in the beginning [co-eternally] with God. 
JHN.1.3	All things were made 
JHN.1.4	In Him was life [and the power to bestow life], and the life was the Light of men. 
JHN.1.5	The Light shines on in the 
JHN.1.6	There came a man commissioned 
JHN.1.7	This man came as a witness, to testify about the Light, so that all might believe [in Christ, the Light] through him. 
JHN.1.8	John was not the Light, but came to testify about the Light.
JHN.1.9	There it was—the true Light [the genuine, perfect, steadfast Light] which, coming into the world, enlightens everyone. 
JHN.1.10	He (Christ) was in the world, and though the world was made through Him, the world did not recognize Him. 
JHN.1.11	He came to that which was His own [that which belonged to Him—His world, His creation, His possession], and those who were His own [people—the Jewish nation] did not receive 
JHN.1.12	But to as many as did receive 
JHN.1.13	who were born, not of blood [natural conception], nor of the will of the flesh [physical impulse], nor of the will of man [that of a natural father], but of God [that is, a divine and supernatural birth—they are born of God—spiritually transformed, renewed, sanctified].
JHN.1.14	And the Word (Christ) became flesh, and lived among us; and we [actually] saw His glory, glory as belongs to the [One and] only begotten 
JHN.1.15	John testified [repeatedly] about Him and 
JHN.1.16	For out of His fullness [the superabundance of His grace and truth] we have all received grace upon grace [spiritual blessing upon spiritual blessing, favor upon favor, and gift heaped upon gift]. 
JHN.1.17	For the Law was given through Moses, but grace [the unearned, undeserved favor of God] and truth came through Jesus Christ. 
JHN.1.18	No one has seen God [His essence, His divine nature] at any time; the [One and] only begotten God [that is, the unique Son] who is in the intimate presence of the Father, He has explained Him [and interpreted and revealed the awesome wonder of the Father].
JHN.1.19	This is the testimony of John [the Baptist] when the Jews sent priests and Levites to him from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?” 
JHN.1.20	And he confessed [truthfully] and did not deny [that he was only a man], but acknowledged, “I am not the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed)!” 
JHN.1.21	They asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” And he said, “I am not.” “Are you the [promised] Prophet?” And he answered, “No.” 
JHN.1.22	Then they said to him, “Who are you? 
JHN.1.23	He said, “I am 
JHN.1.24	Now they had been sent from the Pharisees. 
JHN.1.25	They asked him, “Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” 
JHN.1.26	John answered them, “I baptize [only] 
JHN.1.27	It is He [the preeminent One] who comes after me, the 
JHN.1.28	These things occurred in Bethany across the Jordan [at the Jordan River crossing], where John was baptizing.
JHN.1.29	The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, “Look! The Lamb of God 
JHN.1.30	This is He on behalf of whom I said, ‘After me comes a Man who has a higher rank than I 
JHN.1.31	I did not recognize Him [as the Messiah]; but I came baptizing 
JHN.1.32	John gave [further] evidence [testifying officially for the record, with validity and relevance], saying, “I have seen the 
JHN.1.33	I did not recognize Him [as the Messiah], but He who sent me to baptize 
JHN.1.34	I myself have [actually] seen [that happen], and my testimony is that this is the Son of God!”
JHN.1.35	Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples, 
JHN.1.36	and he looked at Jesus as He walked along, and said, “Look! The Lamb of God!” 
JHN.1.37	The two disciples heard him say this, and they 
JHN.1.38	And Jesus turned and saw them following Him, and asked them, 
JHN.1.39	He said to them, 
JHN.1.40	One of the two who heard what John said and [as a result] followed Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother. 
JHN.1.41	He first looked for 
JHN.1.42	Andrew brought Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, 
JHN.1.43	The next day Jesus decided to go into Galilee, and He found Philip and said to him, 
JHN.1.44	Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. 
JHN.1.45	Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the One Moses in the Law and also the Prophets wrote about—Jesus from Nazareth, the son of Joseph [according to public record].” 
JHN.1.46	Nathanael answered him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip replied, “Come and see.” 
JHN.1.47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him, and said of him, 
JHN.1.48	Nathanael said to Jesus, “How do You know [these things about] me?” Jesus answered, 
JHN.1.49	Nathanael answered, “Rabbi (Teacher), You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel.” 
JHN.1.50	Jesus replied, 
JHN.1.51	Then He said to him, 
JHN.2.1	On the third day there was a wedding at Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there; 
JHN.2.2	and both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding. 
JHN.2.3	When the wine was all gone, the mother of Jesus said to Him, “
JHN.2.4	Jesus said to her, “[Dear] 
JHN.2.5	His mother said to the servants, “Whatever He says to you, do it.” 
JHN.2.6	Now there were six stone waterpots set there for the Jewish custom of purification (ceremonial washing), containing twenty or thirty gallons each. 
JHN.2.7	Jesus said to the servants, 
JHN.2.8	Then He said to them, 
JHN.2.9	And when the headwaiter tasted the water which had turned into wine, not knowing where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew) he called the bridegroom, 
JHN.2.10	and said to him, “Everyone else serves his best wine first, and when 
JHN.2.11	This, the first of His signs (attesting miracles), Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed His glory [displaying His deity and His great power openly], and His disciples believed [confidently] in Him [as the Messiah—they adhered to, trusted in, and relied on Him].
JHN.2.12	After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and brothers and His disciples; and they stayed there a few days.
JHN.2.13	Now the Passover of the Jews was approaching, so Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
JHN.2.14	And in the temple [enclosure] He found the 
JHN.2.15	He made a whip of cords, and drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen; and He scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables; 
JHN.2.16	then to those who sold the doves He said, 
JHN.2.17	His disciples remembered that it is written [in the Scriptures], “Z
JHN.2.18	Then the Jews retorted, “What sign (attesting miracle) can You show us as [proof of] your authority for doing these things?” 
JHN.2.19	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.2.20	Then the Jews replied, “It took forty-six years to build this temple, and You will raise it up in three days?” 
JHN.2.21	But He was speaking of the temple which was His body. 
JHN.2.22	So when He had risen from the dead, His disciples remembered what He had said. And they believed 
JHN.2.23	Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover feast, many believed in His name [identifying themselves with Him] after seeing His signs (attesting miracles) which He was doing. 
JHN.2.24	But Jesus, for His part, did not entrust Himself to them, because He knew all 
JHN.2.25	and He did not need anyone to testify concerning man [and human nature], for He Himself knew what was in man [in their hearts—in the very core of their being].
JHN.3.1	Now there was a certain man among the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler (member of the Sanhedrin) among the Jews, 
JHN.3.2	who came to Jesus at night and said to Him, “Rabbi (Teacher), we know [without any doubt] that You have come from God as a teacher; for no one can do these signs [these wonders, these attesting miracles] that You do unless God is with him.” 
JHN.3.3	Jesus answered him, 
JHN.3.4	Nicodemus said to Him, “How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter his mother’s womb a second time and be born, can he?” 
JHN.3.5	Jesus answered, 
JHN.3.6	 [the physical is merely physical], 
JHN.3.7	 [reborn from above—spiritually transformed, renewed, sanctified].’ 
JHN.3.9	Nicodemus said to Him, “How can these things be 
JHN.3.10	Jesus replied, 
JHN.3.11	 [absolutely] 
JHN.3.12	 [that is, things that happen right here on earth] 
JHN.3.13	 [Himself—whose home is in heaven]. 
JHN.3.14	 [bronze] 
JHN.3.15	 [after physical death, and will actually live forever].
JHN.3.17	 [that is, to initiate the final judgment of the world], 
JHN.3.18	 [as personal Savior and Lord] 
JHN.3.19	 [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: 
JHN.3.20	 [but shrinks from it] 
JHN.3.21	 [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] 
JHN.3.22	After these things Jesus and His disciples went into the land of Judea, and there He spent time with them and baptized. 
JHN.3.23	Now John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was an abundance of water there; and 
JHN.3.24	for John had not yet been thrown into prison.
JHN.3.25	Therefore there arose a controversy between John’s disciples and a Jew in regard to 
JHN.3.26	So they came to John and said to him, “Rabbi (Teacher), the Man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan [at the Jordan River crossing]—and to whom you have testified—look, He is baptizing too, and everyone is going to Him!” 
JHN.3.27	John replied, “A man can receive nothing [he can claim nothing at all] unless it has been granted to him from heaven [for there is no other source than the sovereign will of God]. 
JHN.3.28	You yourselves are my witnesses that I stated, ‘I am not the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed),’ but, ‘I have [only] been sent ahead of Him [as His appointed forerunner and messenger to announce and proclaim His coming].’ 
JHN.3.29	He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands by and listens to him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice. So this pleasure 
JHN.3.30	He must increase [in prominence], but I must decrease.
JHN.3.31	“He who comes from [heaven] above is above all 
JHN.3.32	What He has [actually] seen and heard, of that He testifies; and yet no one accepts His testimony [as true]. 
JHN.3.33	Whoever receives His testimony has set his seal [of approval] to this: God is true [and he knows that God cannot lie]. 
JHN.3.34	For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God [proclaiming the Father’s own message]; for God gives the [gift of the] Spirit without measure [generously and boundlessly]! 
JHN.3.35	The Father loves the Son and has given 
JHN.3.36	He who believes 
JHN.4.1	So when the Lord learned that the Pharisees had been told that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John 
JHN.4.2	(although Jesus Himself was not baptizing, but His disciples were), 
JHN.4.3	He left Judea and returned again to Galilee. 
JHN.4.4	Now 
JHN.4.5	So He arrived at a Samaritan town called Sychar, near the tract of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph; 
JHN.4.6	and Jacob’s well was there. So Jesus, tired as He was from His journey, sat down by the well. It was then about the sixth hour (noon).
JHN.4.7	Then a woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, 
JHN.4.8	For His disciples had gone off into the city to buy food— 
JHN.4.9	The Samaritan woman asked Him, “How is it that You, being a Jew, ask me, a 
JHN.4.10	Jesus answered her, 
JHN.4.11	She said to Him, “Sir, 
JHN.4.12	Are You greater than our father 
JHN.4.13	Jesus answered her, 
JHN.4.14	 [satisfying his thirst for God] 
JHN.4.15	The woman said to Him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I will not get thirsty nor [have to continually] come all the way here to draw.” 
JHN.4.16	At this, Jesus said, 
JHN.4.17	The woman answered, “I do not have a husband.” Jesus said to her, 
JHN.4.19	The woman said to Him, “Sir, I see that You are a prophet. 
JHN.4.20	Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you 
JHN.4.21	Jesus replied, 
JHN.4.22	 [Samaritans] 
JHN.4.23	 [from the heart, the inner self] 
JHN.4.24	 [the Source of life, yet invisible to mankind], 
JHN.4.25	The woman said to Him, “I know that Messiah is coming (He who is called Christ—the Anointed); when that One comes, He will tell us everything [we need to know].” 
JHN.4.26	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.4.27	Just then His disciples came, and they were surprised to find Him talking with a woman. However, no one said, “What are You asking about?” or, “Why are You talking to her?” 
JHN.4.28	Then the woman left her water jar, and went into the city and began telling the people, 
JHN.4.29	“Come, see a man who told me all the things that I have done! Can this be the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed)?” 
JHN.4.30	So the people left the city and were coming to Him.
JHN.4.31	Meanwhile, the disciples were urging Jesus [to have a meal], saying, “Rabbi (Teacher), eat.” 
JHN.4.32	But He told them, 
JHN.4.33	So the disciples said to one another, “Has anyone brought Him 
JHN.4.34	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.4.37	 [person] 
JHN.4.38	 [a crop] 
JHN.4.39	Now many Samaritans from that city believed in Him 
JHN.4.40	So when the Samaritans came to Jesus, they asked Him to remain with them; and He stayed there two days. 
JHN.4.41	Many more believed in Him [with a deep, abiding trust] because of His word [His personal message to them]; 
JHN.4.42	and they told the woman, “We no longer believe 
JHN.4.43	After the two days He went on from there into Galilee. 
JHN.4.44	For Jesus Himself declared that a prophet has no honor in his own country. 
JHN.4.45	So when He arrived in Galilee, the Galileans 
JHN.4.46	So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee, where He had turned the water into wine. And there was a 
JHN.4.47	Having heard that Jesus had come back from Judea to Galilee, he 
JHN.4.48	Then Jesus said to him, 
JHN.4.49	The royal official pleaded with Him, “Sir, do come down [at once] before my child dies!” 
JHN.4.50	Jesus said to him, 
JHN.4.51	As he was already going down [the road], his servants met him and reported that his son was living [and was healthy]. 
JHN.4.52	So he asked them at what time he began to get better. They said, “Yesterday during the seventh hour the fever left him.” 
JHN.4.53	Then the father realized that it was at that 
JHN.4.54	This is the second sign (attesting miracle) that Jesus performed [in Cana] after He had come from Judea to Galilee [revealing that He is the Messiah].
JHN.5.1	Later on there was a Jewish feast (festival), and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
JHN.5.2	Now in Jerusalem, near the Sheep Gate, there is a 
JHN.5.3	In these 
JHN.5.4	for an angel of the Lord went down into the pool at appointed seasons and stirred up the water; the first one to go in after the water was stirred was healed of his disease.
JHN.5.5	There was a certain man there who had been ill for thirty-eight years. 
JHN.5.6	When Jesus noticed him lying there [helpless], knowing that he had been 
JHN.5.7	The invalid answered, “Sir, I have no one to put me in the pool when the water is stirred up, and while I am coming [to get into it myself], someone else steps down ahead of me.” 
JHN.5.8	Jesus said to him, 
JHN.5.9	Immediately the man was healed 
JHN.5.10	So the Jews kept saying to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath, and you are not 
JHN.5.11	He answered them, “The Man who healed me 
JHN.5.12	They asked him, “Who is the Man who told you, 
JHN.5.13	Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away [unnoticed] since there was a crowd in that place. 
JHN.5.14	Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, 
JHN.5.15	The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. 
JHN.5.16	For this reason the Jews began to persecute Jesus 
JHN.5.17	But Jesus answered them, 
JHN.5.18	This made the Jews more determined than ever to kill Him, for not only was He breaking the Sabbath [from their viewpoint], but He was also calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.
JHN.5.19	So Jesus answered them by saying, 
JHN.5.21	 [and allows them to live on], 
JHN.5.22	 [that is, the prerogative of judging] 
JHN.5.23	 [In fact] 
JHN.5.26	 [and is self-existent], 
JHN.5.27	 [sinless humanity, qualifying Him to sit in judgment over mankind]. 
JHN.5.29	 [will come out] 
JHN.5.32	 [My Father] 
JHN.5.34	 [a merely human witness]; 
JHN.5.35	 [to show you the way], 
JHN.5.38	 [actually living in your hearts and minds], 
JHN.5.43	 [because your minds are closed]; 
JHN.5.44	 [in Me], 
JHN.5.45	 [am the One who] 
JHN.5.46	 [the Scriptures written by] 
JHN.6.1	After this, Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (or 
JHN.6.2	A large crowd was following Him because they had seen the signs (attesting miracles) which He 
JHN.6.3	And Jesus went up on the mountainside and sat down there with His disciples. 
JHN.6.4	Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was approaching. 
JHN.6.5	Jesus looked up and saw that a large crowd was coming toward Him, and He said to Philip, 
JHN.6.6	But He said this to test Philip, because He knew what He was about to do. 
JHN.6.7	Philip answered, “Two hundred denarii (200 days’ wages) worth of bread is not enough for each one to receive even a little.” 
JHN.6.8	One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to Him, 
JHN.6.9	“There is a little boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what are these for so many people?” 
JHN.6.10	Jesus said, 
JHN.6.11	Then Jesus took the loaves, and when He had given thanks, He distributed them to those who were seated; the same also with the fish, as much as they wanted. 
JHN.6.12	When they had eaten enough, He said to His disciples, 
JHN.6.13	So they gathered them up, and they filled twelve large baskets with pieces from the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten. 
JHN.6.14	When the people saw the sign (attesting miracle) that He had done, they 
JHN.6.15	Then Jesus, knowing that they were going to come and take Him by force to make Him king, withdrew again to the mountainside by Himself.
JHN.6.16	When evening came, His disciples went down to the sea, 
JHN.6.17	and they got into a boat and started to cross the sea to Capernaum. It was already dark, and Jesus had still not come [back] to them. 
JHN.6.18	The sea was getting rough 
JHN.6.19	Then, when they had rowed 
JHN.6.20	But Jesus said to them, 
JHN.6.21	Then they were willing to take Him on board the boat, and immediately the boat reached the [shore of the] land to which they were going.
JHN.6.22	The next day the crowd that stood on the other side of the sea realized that there had been only one small boat there, and that Jesus had not boarded the boat with His disciples, but that His disciples had gone away alone. 
JHN.6.23	[Now some] other small boats from 
JHN.6.24	So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there, they boarded the small boats themselves and came to Capernaum looking for Jesus. 
JHN.6.25	And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they asked Him, “Rabbi, when did You get here?”
JHN.6.26	Jesus answered, 
JHN.6.27	 [and leads] 
JHN.6.28	Then they asked Him, “What are we to do, so that we may 
JHN.6.29	Jesus answered, 
JHN.6.30	So they said to Him, “What sign (attesting miracle) will You do that we may see it and believe You? What [supernatural] work will You do [as proof]? 
JHN.6.31	Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written [in Scripture], ‘H
JHN.6.32	Then Jesus said to them, 
JHN.6.34	Then they said to Him, “Lord, always give us this bread.”
JHN.6.35	Jesus replied to them, 
JHN.6.37	 [I will never, never reject anyone who follows Me]. 
JHN.6.39	 [give new life and] 
JHN.6.40	 [as Savior] 
JHN.6.41	Now the Jews murmured 
JHN.6.42	They kept saying, “Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does He now [have the arrogance to] say, 
JHN.6.43	So Jesus answered, 
JHN.6.44	 [giving him the desire to come to Me]; 
JHN.6.46	 [who was with the Father and] 
JHN.6.47	 [in Me as Savior—whoever adheres to, trusts in, relies on, and has faith in Me—already] 
JHN.6.48	 [the Living Bread which gives and sustains life]. 
JHN.6.51	 [believes in Me, accepts Me as Savior], 
JHN.6.52	Then the Jews 
JHN.6.53	And Jesus said to them, 
JHN.6.54	 [believes in Me, accepts Me as Savior] 
JHN.6.55	 [spiritual] 
JHN.6.56	 [believes in Me, accepts Me as Savior] 
JHN.6.57	 [believes in Me, accepts Me as Savior] 
JHN.6.58	 [the manna that] 
JHN.6.59	He said these things in a synagogue while He was teaching in Capernaum.
JHN.6.60	When many of His disciples heard 
JHN.6.61	But Jesus, aware that His disciples were complaining about it, asked them, 
JHN.6.62	 [will you think] 
JHN.6.63	 [it is of no account]. 
JHN.6.64	 [still] 
JHN.6.65	And He was saying, 
JHN.6.66	As a result of this 
JHN.6.67	So Jesus said to the twelve [disciples], 
JHN.6.68	Simon Peter answered, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You [alone] have the words of eternal life [you are our only hope]. 
JHN.6.69	We have believed 
JHN.6.70	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.6.71	Now He was speaking of Judas, 
JHN.7.1	After this, Jesus walked [from place to place] in Galilee, for He would not walk in Judea because the Jews were seeking to kill Him. 
JHN.7.2	Now the Jewish 
JHN.7.3	So His 
JHN.7.4	No one does anything in secret when he wants to be 
JHN.7.5	For not even His brothers believed in Him. 
JHN.7.6	So Jesus said to them, 
JHN.7.7	 [since you are part of it], 
JHN.7.9	Having said these things to them, He stayed behind in Galilee.
JHN.7.10	But [afterward], when His brothers had gone up to the feast, He went up too, not publicly [with a caravan], but quietly [because He did not want to be noticed]. 
JHN.7.11	So the Jews kept looking for Him at the feast and asking, “Where is He?” 
JHN.7.12	There was a lot of whispered discussion 
JHN.7.13	Yet no one was speaking out openly 
JHN.7.14	When the feast was already half over, Jesus went up into the temple [court] and 
JHN.7.15	Then the Jews were perplexed. They said, “How 
JHN.7.16	Jesus answered them by saying, 
JHN.7.20	The crowd answered, “You have a demon [You are out of Your mind]! Who wants to kill You?” 
JHN.7.21	Jesus replied, 
JHN.7.22	 [God’s law regarding] 
JHN.7.24	 [superficially and arrogantly], 
JHN.7.25	Then some of the people of Jerusalem said, “Is this not the Man they want to kill? 
JHN.7.26	Look, He is speaking publicly, and they say nothing to Him! Is it possible that the rulers really know that this is the Christ? 
JHN.7.27	But we know where this Man is from; whenever the Christ comes, no one will know where He is from.” 
JHN.7.28	Then Jesus called out as He taught in the temple, 
JHN.7.29	 [I came from His very presence] 
JHN.7.30	So they were eager to arrest Him; but no one laid a hand on Him, because His time had not yet come. 
JHN.7.31	But many from the crowd believed in Him. And they kept saying, “When the Christ comes, will He do more signs 
JHN.7.32	The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things [under their breath] about Him, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent 
JHN.7.33	Therefore Jesus said, 
JHN.7.34	 [be able to] 
JHN.7.35	Then the Jews said among themselves, “Where does this Man intend to go that we will not find Him? Does He intend to go to the Dispersion [of Jews scattered and living] among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? 
JHN.7.36	What does this statement of His mean, 
JHN.7.37	Now on the last and most important day of the feast, Jesus stood and called out [in a loud voice], 
JHN.7.38	 [who adheres to, trusts in, and relies on Me], 
JHN.7.39	But He was speaking of the [Holy] Spirit, whom those who believed in Him [as Savior] were to receive 
JHN.7.40	Listening to these words, some of the people said, “This is certainly the Prophet!” 
JHN.7.41	Others said, “This is the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed)!” But others said, “Surely the Christ is not going to come out of Galilee, is He? 
JHN.7.42	Does the Scripture not say that the Christ comes from the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David lived?” 
JHN.7.43	So the crowd was divided because of Him. 
JHN.7.44	Some of them wanted to arrest Him, but no one laid hands on Him.
JHN.7.45	Then the guards went [back] to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, “Why did you not bring Him [here with you]?” 
JHN.7.46	The guards replied, “Never [at any time] has a man talked the way this Man talks!” 
JHN.7.47	Then the Pharisees said to them, “Have you also been deluded 
JHN.7.48	Has any of the rulers or Pharisees believed in Him? 
JHN.7.49	But this [ignorant, contemptible] crowd that does not know the Law is accursed 
JHN.7.50	Nicodemus (the one who came to Jesus before and was one of them) asked, 
JHN.7.51	“Does our Law convict someone without first giving him a hearing and finding out what he is [accused of] doing?” 
JHN.7.52	They responded, “Are you also from Galilee? Search [and read the Scriptures], and see [for yourself] that no prophet comes from Galilee!” 
JHN.7.53	And everyone went to his own house.
JHN.8.1	But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 
JHN.8.2	Early in the morning He came back into the temple [court], and all the people were coming to Him. He sat down and 
JHN.8.3	Now the scribes and Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery. They made her stand in the center 
JHN.8.4	and they said to Him, “Teacher, this woman has been caught in the very act of adultery. 
JHN.8.5	Now in the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women [to death]. So what do You say [to do with her—what is Your sentence]?” 
JHN.8.6	They said this to test Him, hoping that they would have grounds for accusing Him. But Jesus stooped down and began writing on the ground with His finger. 
JHN.8.7	However, when they persisted in questioning Him, He straightened up and said, 
JHN.8.8	Then He stooped down again and started writing on the ground. 
JHN.8.9	They listened [to His reply], and they 
JHN.8.10	Straightening up, Jesus said to her, 
JHN.8.11	She answered, “No one, Lord!” And Jesus said, 
JHN.8.12	Once more Jesus addressed the crowd. He said, 
JHN.8.13	Then the Pharisees told Him, “You are testifying on Your own behalf; Your testimony is not valid.” 
JHN.8.14	Jesus replied, 
JHN.8.15	 [just by what you see]. 
JHN.8.16	 [in making it], 
JHN.8.17	 [valid and admissible]. 
JHN.8.18	 [of the Two] 
JHN.8.19	Then the Pharisees said to Him, “Where is this Father of Yours?” Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.20	Jesus said these things in the treasury, as He taught in the temple [courtyard]; and no one seized Him, because His time had not yet come.
JHN.8.21	Then He said again to them, 
JHN.8.22	So the Jews were asking [among themselves], “Will He kill Himself? Is that why He says, 
JHN.8.23	He said to them, 
JHN.8.24	 [unforgiven and condemned] 
JHN.8.25	So they said to Him, “Who are You [anyway]?” Jesus replied, 
JHN.8.26	 [only] 
JHN.8.27	They did not realize [or have the spiritual insight to understand] that He was speaking to them about the Father. 
JHN.8.28	So Jesus said, 
JHN.8.29	 [always] 
JHN.8.30	As He said these things, 
JHN.8.31	So Jesus was saying to the Jews who had believed Him, 
JHN.8.32	 [regarding salvation], 
JHN.8.33	They answered Him, “We are Abraham’s descendants and have never been enslaved to anyone. 
JHN.8.34	Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.35	 [of the master] 
JHN.8.37	 [to grow] 
JHN.8.38	 [in His very presence]; 
JHN.8.39	They answered, “Abraham is our father.” Jesus said to them, 
JHN.8.41	 [own] 
JHN.8.42	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.8.43	 [your spiritual ears are deaf and] 
JHN.8.44	 [which are characteristic] 
JHN.8.45	 [and continue in your unbelief]. 
JHN.8.46	 [has proof and] 
JHN.8.47	 [the truth of] 
JHN.8.48	The Jews answered Him, “Are we not right when we say You are a 
JHN.8.49	Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.50	 [glory for Me] 
JHN.8.51	 [by living in accordance with My message] 
JHN.8.52	The Jews said to Him, “Now we know that You have a demon [and are under its power]. Abraham died, and also the prophets; yet You say, 
JHN.8.53	Are You greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets died too! Whom do You make Yourself out to be?” 
JHN.8.54	Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.56	 [greatly] 
JHN.8.57	Then the Jews said to Him, “You are not even fifty years old, and You [claim to] have seen Abraham?” 
JHN.8.58	Jesus replied, 
JHN.8.59	So they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus concealed Himself and left the temple.
JHN.9.1	While He was passing by, He noticed a man [who had been] blind from birth. 
JHN.9.2	His disciples asked Him, “Rabbi (Teacher), who 
JHN.9.3	Jesus answered, 
JHN.9.5	 [giving guidance through My word and works].” 
JHN.9.6	When He had said this, He spat on the ground and made mud with His saliva, and He spread the mud [like an ointment] on the man’s eyes. 
JHN.9.7	And He said to him, 
JHN.9.8	So the neighbors, and those who used to know him as a beggar, said, “Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?” 
JHN.9.9	Some said, “It is he.” Still others said, “No, but he looks like him.” But he kept saying, “I am the man.” 
JHN.9.10	So they said to him, “How were your eyes opened?” 
JHN.9.11	He replied, “The Man called Jesus made mud and smeared it on my eyes and told me, 
JHN.9.12	They asked him, “Where is He?” He said, “I do not know.”
JHN.9.13	Then they brought the man who was formerly blind to the Pharisees. 
JHN.9.14	Now it was on a Sabbath day that Jesus made the mud and opened the man’s eyes. 
JHN.9.15	So the Pharisees asked him again how he received his sight. And he said to them, “He smeared mud on my eyes, and I washed, and now I see.” 
JHN.9.16	Then some of the Pharisees said, “This Man [Jesus] is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath.” But others said, “How can a man who is a sinner (a non-observant Jew) do such signs 
JHN.9.17	Accordingly they said to the blind man again, “What do you say about Him, since He opened your eyes?” And he said, “[It must be that] He is a 
JHN.9.18	However, the Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they called the man’s parents. 
JHN.9.19	They asked them, “Is this your son, who you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?” 
JHN.9.20	His parents answered, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; 
JHN.9.21	but as to how he now sees, we do not know; or who has opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him [and stop asking us]; 
JHN.9.22	His parents said this because they were afraid of [the leaders of] the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone acknowledged Jesus to be the Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue (excommunicated). 
JHN.9.23	Because of this his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.”
JHN.9.24	So a second time they called the man who had been [born] blind, and said to him, “Give God glory 
JHN.9.25	Then he answered, “I do not know whether He is a sinner [separated from God]; but one thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.” 
JHN.9.26	So they said to him, “What did He [actually] do to you? How did He open your eyes?” 
JHN.9.27	He answered, “I already told you and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again 
JHN.9.28	And [at that remark] they stormed at him and jeered, “You are His disciple, but we are disciples of Moses! 
JHN.9.29	We know [for certain] that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this Man, we do not know where He is from.” 
JHN.9.30	The man replied, “Well, this is astonishing! You do not know where He comes from, and yet He opened my eyes! 
JHN.9.31	We know [according to your tradition] that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone fears God and does His will, He hears him. 
JHN.9.32	Since the 
JHN.9.33	If this Man were not from God, He would not be able to do anything [like this because God would not hear His prayer].” 
JHN.9.34	They answered him, “You were 
JHN.9.35	Jesus heard that they had 
JHN.9.36	He answered, “Who is He, Sir? Tell me so that I may believe in Him.” 
JHN.9.37	Jesus said to him, 
JHN.9.38	And he said, “Lord, I believe [in You and Your word]!” And he worshiped Him [with reverence and awe]. 
JHN.9.39	Then Jesus said, 
JHN.9.40	Some Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him, “Are we also blind?” 
JHN.9.41	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.10.2	 [the protector and provider]. 
JHN.10.3	 [the gate] 
JHN.10.6	Jesus used this figure of speech with them, but they did not understand what He was talking about.
JHN.10.7	So Jesus said again, 
JHN.10.8	 [as false messiahs and self-appointed leaders] 
JHN.10.9	 [and will live forever], 
JHN.10.10	 [to the full, till it overflows].
JHN.10.12	 [who merely serves for wages], 
JHN.10.13	 [who serves only for wages] 
JHN.10.14	 [without any doubt those who are] 
JHN.10.15	 [very own] 
JHN.10.16	 [beside these] 
JHN.10.17	 [own] 
JHN.10.19	A division [of opinion] occurred again among the Jews because of these words [of His]. 
JHN.10.20	Many of them said, “He has a demon and He is mad [insane—He raves and rambles]. Why listen to Him?” 
JHN.10.21	Others were saying, “These are not the words 
JHN.10.22	At that time the 
JHN.10.23	It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple [area] in 
JHN.10.24	So the Jews surrounded Him and began saying to Him, “How long are You going to keep us in suspense? If You are [really] the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed), tell us so plainly 
JHN.10.25	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.10.26	 [so you do not trust and follow Me] 
JHN.10.28	 [by any means] 
JHN.10.30	 [in essence and nature].”
JHN.10.31	Again the Jews picked up stones to stone Him. 
JHN.10.32	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.10.33	The Jews answered Him, “We are not going to stone You for a good work, but for blasphemy, because You, a 
JHN.10.34	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.10.35	(and the Scripture cannot be undone 
JHN.10.36	[if that is true] 
JHN.10.37	 [that is, the miracles that only God could perform], 
JHN.10.38	 [at least] 
JHN.10.39	So they tried again to seize Him, but He eluded their grasp.
JHN.10.40	He went back again across the Jordan to the place where John was first baptizing, and He was staying there. 
JHN.10.41	Many came to Him, and they were saying, “John did not perform a single sign (attesting miracle), but everything John said about this Man was true 
JHN.10.42	And many there believed 
JHN.11.1	Now a certain man named Lazarus was sick. He was from 
JHN.11.2	It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick. 
JHN.11.3	So the sisters sent 
JHN.11.4	When Jesus heard this, He said, 
JHN.11.5	Now Jesus loved 
JHN.11.6	So [even] when He heard that Lazarus was sick, He stayed in the same place two more days. 
JHN.11.7	Then He said to His disciples, 
JHN.11.8	The disciples said to Him, “Rabbi (Teacher), the Jews were only recently going to stone You, and You are [thinking of] going back there again?” 
JHN.11.9	Jesus answered, 
JHN.11.11	He said this, and after that said, 
JHN.11.12	The disciples answered, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.” 
JHN.11.13	However, Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that He was referring to natural sleep. 
JHN.11.14	So then Jesus told them plainly, 
JHN.11.16	Then Thomas, who was called Didymus (the twin), said to his fellow disciples, “Let us go too, that we may die with Him.”
JHN.11.17	So when Jesus arrived, He found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb 
JHN.11.18	Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away; 
JHN.11.19	and many of the Jews had come to see Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning [the loss of] their brother. 
JHN.11.20	So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet Him, while Mary remained sitting in the house. 
JHN.11.21	Then Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died. 
JHN.11.22	Even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give to You.” 
JHN.11.23	Jesus told her, 
JHN.11.24	Martha replied, “I know that he will rise [from the dead] in the resurrection on the last day.” 
JHN.11.25	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.11.26	 [as Savior] 
JHN.11.27	She said to Him, “Yes, Lord; I have believed 
JHN.11.28	After she had said this, she left and called her sister Mary, privately whispering [to her], “The Teacher is here and is asking for you.” 
JHN.11.29	And when she heard this, she got up quickly and went to Him.
JHN.11.30	Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met Him. 
JHN.11.31	So when the Jews who were with her in the house comforting her, saw how quickly Mary got up and left, they followed her, assuming that she was going to the tomb to weep there. 
JHN.11.32	When Mary came [to the place] where Jesus was and saw Him, she fell at His feet, saying to Him, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.” 
JHN.11.33	When Jesus saw her sobbing, and the Jews who had come with her also sobbing, He was 
JHN.11.34	and said, 
JHN.11.35	Jesus wept. 
JHN.11.36	So the Jews were saying, “See how He loved him [as a close friend]!” 
JHN.11.37	But some of them said, “Could not this Man, who opened the blind man’s eyes, have kept this man from dying?”
JHN.11.38	So Jesus, again deeply moved within [to the point of anger], approached the tomb. It was a cave, and a boulder was lying against it [to cover the entrance]. 
JHN.11.39	Jesus said, 
JHN.11.40	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.11.41	So they took away the stone. And Jesus raised His eyes [toward heaven] and said, 
JHN.11.42	 [and that You have made Me Your representative].” 
JHN.11.43	When He had said this, He shouted with a loud voice, 
JHN.11.44	Out came the man who had been dead, his hands and feet 
JHN.11.45	So then, many of the Jews who had come to [be with] Mary and who were eyewitnesses to what Jesus had done, believed in Him. 
JHN.11.46	But some of them went back to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
JHN.11.47	So the chief priests and Pharisees convened a council [of the leaders in Israel], and said, “What are we doing? For this man performs many signs (attesting miracles). 
JHN.11.48	If we let Him go on like this, everyone will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our [holy] place (the temple) and our nation.” 
JHN.11.49	But one of them, 
JHN.11.50	Nor do you understand that it is expedient 
JHN.11.51	Now he did not say this [simply] on his own initiative; but being the high priest that year, he [was unknowingly used by God and] prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation, 
JHN.11.52	and not only for the nation, but also for the purpose of gathering together into one body the children of God who have been scattered abroad. 
JHN.11.53	So from that day on they planned together to kill Him.
JHN.11.54	For that reason Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but left there 
JHN.11.55	Now the Passover of the Jews was approaching, and many from the country went up to Jerusalem before Passover to purify themselves [ceremonially, so that they would be able to participate in the feast]. 
JHN.11.56	So they were looking for Jesus as they stood in the temple [area], and saying among themselves, “What do you think? Will He not come to the feast at all?” 
JHN.11.57	Now the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was, he was to report it so that they might arrest Him.
JHN.12.1	Six days before the Passover, Jesus went to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom He had raised from the dead. 
JHN.12.2	So they gave a supper for Him there. Martha was serving, and Lazarus was one of those reclining 
JHN.12.3	Then 
JHN.12.4	But Judas Iscariot, one of His disciples, the one who was going to betray Him, said, 
JHN.12.5	“Why was this perfume not sold for 
JHN.12.6	Now he said this, not because he cared about the poor [for he had never cared about them], but because he was a thief; and since he had the money box [serving as treasurer for the twelve disciples], he used to pilfer what was put into it. 
JHN.12.7	So Jesus said, 
JHN.12.9	A large crowd of Jews learned that He was there [at Bethany]; and they came, not only because of Jesus, but also to see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead. 
JHN.12.10	So the chief priests planned to kill Lazarus also, 
JHN.12.11	because on account of him many of the Jews were going away [from the teaching and traditions of the Jewish leaders] and believing in Jesus [following Him as Savior and Messiah].
JHN.12.12	The next day, when the large crowd who had come to the 
JHN.12.13	they took branches of palm trees [in homage to Him as King] and went out to meet Him, and they 
JHN.12.14	And Jesus, finding a young donkey, sat on it; just as it is written [in Scripture], 
JHN.12.15	“D
JHN.12.16	His disciples did not understand [the meaning of] these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified 
JHN.12.17	So the people, who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, continued to tell others 
JHN.12.18	For this reason the crowd went to meet Him, because they heard that He had performed this [miraculous] sign. 
JHN.12.19	Then the Pharisees [argued and] said to one another, “You see that your efforts are futile. Look! The whole world has gone [running] after Him!”
JHN.12.20	Now there were some Greeks (Gentiles) among those who were going up to worship at the feast; 
JHN.12.21	these came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request, saying, “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.” 
JHN.12.22	Philip came and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. 
JHN.12.23	And Jesus answered them, 
JHN.12.24	 [just one grain, never more]. 
JHN.12.25	 [eventually] 
JHN.12.26	 [continue to faithfully] 
JHN.12.28	[Rather, I will say,] 
JHN.12.29	The crowd 
JHN.12.30	Jesus answered, 
JHN.12.31	 [the sentence is being passed]. 
JHN.12.32	 [on the cross], 
JHN.12.33	He said this to indicate the kind of death by which He was to die. 
JHN.12.34	At this the crowd answered Him, “
JHN.12.35	So Jesus said to them, 
JHN.12.36	 [have faith in it, hold on to it, rely on it], 
JHN.12.37	Even though He had done so many signs (attesting miracles) right before them, yet they still did not believe 
JHN.12.38	 to fulfill what Isaiah the prophet said: “L
JHN.12.39	Therefore they could not believe, for Isaiah said again, 
JHN.12.40	“H
JHN.12.41	Isaiah said these things because he saw His glory and spoke about Him. 
JHN.12.42	Nevertheless, even many of the leading men believed in Him [as Savior and Messiah], but because of the Pharisees they would not confess it, for fear that [if they acknowledged Him openly] they would be put out of the synagogue (excommunicated); 
JHN.12.43	for they loved the approval of men more than the approval of God.
JHN.12.44	But Jesus loudly declared, 
JHN.12.46	 [as Savior—all those who anchor their hope in Me and rely on the truth of My message] 
JHN.12.47	 [that is, to initiate the final judgment of the world], 
JHN.12.50	 [in accordance with His exact instruction,] 
JHN.13.1	Now before the Passover Feast, Jesus knew that His hour had come [and it was time] for Him to leave this world 
JHN.13.2	It was during supper, when the devil had already put [the thought of] betraying Jesus into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, 
JHN.13.3	that Jesus, knowing that the Father had put everything into His hands, and that He had come from God and was [now] returning to God, 
JHN.13.4	got up from supper, took off His [outer] robe, and taking a [servant’s] towel, He tied it around His waist.
JHN.13.5	Then He poured water into the basin and began washing the disciples’ feet and wiping them with the towel which was tied around His waist. 
JHN.13.6	When He came to Simon Peter, he said to Him, “Lord, are You going to wash my feet?” 
JHN.13.7	Jesus replied to him, 
JHN.13.8	Peter said to Him, “You will never wash my feet!” Jesus answered, 
JHN.13.9	Simon Peter said to Him, “Lord, [in that case, wash] not only my feet, but also my hands and my head!” 
JHN.13.10	Jesus said to him, 
JHN.13.11	For He knew who was going to betray Him; for that reason He said, 
JHN.13.12	So when He had washed their feet and put on His [outer] robe and reclined 
JHN.13.15	 [this as] 
JHN.13.17	 [happy and favored by God] 
JHN.13.18	 [this has happened] 
JHN.13.19	 [what will happen] 
JHN.13.20	 [in that same way].”
JHN.13.21	After Jesus had said these things, He was 
JHN.13.22	The disciples 
JHN.13.23	One of His disciples, whom Jesus loved (esteemed), was 
JHN.13.24	So Simon Peter motioned to him (John) and [quietly] asked [him to ask Jesus] of whom He was speaking. 
JHN.13.25	Then leaning back against Jesus’ chest, he (John) asked Him [privately], “Lord, who is it?” 
JHN.13.26	Jesus answered, 
JHN.13.27	After [Judas had taken] the piece of bread, Satan entered him. Then Jesus said to him, 
JHN.13.28	But no one reclining 
JHN.13.29	Some thought that, since Judas [as the treasurer of the group] had the money box, Jesus was telling him, “Buy what we need for the feast,” or that he was to 
JHN.13.30	After taking the piece of bread, he went out immediately; and it was night.
JHN.13.31	So when Judas had left, Jesus said, 
JHN.13.33	 [only] 
JHN.13.36	Simon Peter said to Him, “Lord, where are You going?” Jesus answered, 
JHN.13.37	Peter said to Him, “Lord, why cannot I follow You now? I will lay down my life for You!” 
JHN.13.38	Jesus answered, 
JHN.14.4	 [to the place] 
JHN.14.5	Thomas said to Him, “Lord, we do not know where You are going; so how can we know the way?” 
JHN.14.6	Jesus said to him, 
JHN.14.8	Philip said to Him, “Lord, show us the Father and then we will be satisfied.” 
JHN.14.9	Jesus said to him, 
JHN.14.10	 [His attesting miracles and acts of power]. 
JHN.14.11	 [Me] 
JHN.14.12	 [as Savior] 
JHN.14.13	 [
JHN.14.14	 [as My representative], 
JHN.14.17	 [and take to its heart] 
JHN.14.20	 [when that time comes] 
JHN.14.21	 [really] 
JHN.14.22	Judas (not Iscariot) asked Him, “Lord, what has happened that You are going to reveal Yourself to us and not to the world?” 
JHN.14.23	Jesus answered, 
JHN.14.24	 [really] 
JHN.14.26	 [in My place, to represent Me and act on My behalf], 
JHN.14.27	 [perfect] 
JHN.14.28	 [really] 
JHN.14.29	 [in Me]. 
JHN.14.30	 [no power over Me nor anything that he can use against Me]; 
JHN.14.31	 [without any doubt] 
JHN.15.2	 [repeatedly] 
JHN.15.3	 [the teachings which I have discussed with you]. 
JHN.15.4	 [will remain] 
JHN.15.5	 [otherwise] 
JHN.15.6	 [broken off] 
JHN.15.7	 [that is, if we are vitally united and My message lives in your heart], 
JHN.15.8	 [true] 
JHN.15.9	 [and do not doubt My love for you]. 
JHN.15.13	 [nor stronger commitment] 
JHN.15.15	 [My] 
JHN.15.16	 [as My representative] 
JHN.15.17	 [is what] 
JHN.15.19	 [you as] 
JHN.15.20	 [and continue to remember] 
JHN.15.21	 [hurtful] 
JHN.15.22	 [the guilt of their] 
JHN.15.24	 [ever] 
JHN.15.25	 [this is so] 
JHN.16.4	 [now], 
JHN.16.6	 [and taken complete possession of them]. 
JHN.16.7	 [to be in close fellowship with you]. 
JHN.16.8	 [the guilt of] 
JHN.16.9	 [and the true nature of it], 
JHN.16.10	 [personal integrity and godly character], 
JHN.16.11	 [the certainty of it], 
JHN.16.13	 [full and complete truth]. 
JHN.16.15	 [the Spirit] 
JHN.16.17	Some of His disciples said to one another, “What does He mean when He tells us, 
JHN.16.18	So they were saying, “What does He mean when He says, 
JHN.16.19	Jesus knew that they wanted to ask Him, so He said to them, 
JHN.16.20	 [in great mourning], 
JHN.16.21	 [to give birth] 
JHN.16.22	 [then] 
JHN.16.24	 [the Father] 
JHN.16.26	 [because it will be unnecessary]; 
JHN.16.27	 [tenderly] 
JHN.16.29	His disciples said, “Ah, now You are speaking plainly to us and not in figures of speech! 
JHN.16.30	Now we know that You know all things, and have no need for anyone to question You; because of this we believe [without any doubt] that you came from God.” 
JHN.16.31	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.16.33	 [perfect] 
JHN.17.1	When Jesus had spoken these things, He raised His eyes to heaven [in prayer] and said, 
JHN.17.2	 [now glorify Him] 
JHN.17.3	 [supreme and sovereign] 
JHN.17.4	 [down here] 
JHN.17.7	 [at last] 
JHN.17.8	 [with confident assurance] 
JHN.17.10	 [all things that are] 
JHN.17.14	 [the message You gave Me]; 
JHN.17.17	 [set them apart for Your purposes, make them holy]; 
JHN.17.19	 [to do Your will], 
JHN.17.21	 [without any doubt] 
JHN.17.23	 [without any doubt] 
JHN.17.24	 [as Your gift to Me], 
JHN.17.26	 [overwhelming their heart], 
JHN.18.1	Having said these things, Jesus left with His disciples and went across the 
JHN.18.2	Now Judas, who was betraying Him, knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with His disciples. 
JHN.18.3	So Judas, having obtained the 
JHN.18.4	Then Jesus, knowing all that was about to happen to Him, went to them and asked, 
JHN.18.5	They answered Him, “Jesus the Nazarene.” Jesus said, 
JHN.18.6	When Jesus said, 
JHN.18.7	Again He asked them, 
JHN.18.8	Jesus answered, 
JHN.18.9	 to fulfill 
JHN.18.10	Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant, cutting off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus. 
JHN.18.11	So Jesus said to Peter, 
JHN.18.12	So the cohort and their commander and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound Him, 
JHN.18.13	and led Him to 
JHN.18.14	It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was expedient for one man to die on behalf of the people.
JHN.18.15	Simon Peter and 
JHN.18.16	but Peter was standing outside at the door. So the other disciple (John), who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought Peter inside. 
JHN.18.17	Then the servant girl who kept the door said to Peter, “You are not one of this Man’s disciples, are you?” He said, “I am not.” 
JHN.18.18	Now the servants and the officers had made a fire of coals, because it was cold, and they were standing and warming themselves. And Peter was with them, standing and warming himself.
JHN.18.19	Then the high priest questioned Jesus about His disciples and about His teaching. 
JHN.18.20	Jesus answered him, 
JHN.18.22	But when He said this, one of the officers who was standing nearby 
JHN.18.23	Jesus replied, 
JHN.18.24	So Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
JHN.18.25	Now Simon Peter was [still] standing and warming himself. So they said to him, “You are not one of His disciples, are you?” He denied it and said, “I am not.” 
JHN.18.26	One of the high priest’s servants, a relative of the one whose ear Peter cut off, said, “Did I not see you with Him in the garden?” 
JHN.18.27	So Peter denied it again, and immediately a rooster crowed.
JHN.18.28	Then the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium (governor’s palace). Now it was early and the Jews did not enter the Praetorium so that they would not be [ceremonially] unclean, but might [be able to] eat [and participate in the Feast of Unleavened Bread which began after] the 
JHN.18.29	So Pilate came out to them and asked, “What accusation do you bring against this Man?” 
JHN.18.30	They answered, “If He were not a criminal, we would not have handed Him over to you [for judgment].” 
JHN.18.31	Then Pilate said to them, “Take Him yourselves and judge Him according to your own law.” The Jews said, “We are not permitted to put anyone to death.” 
JHN.18.32	 to fulfill the word which Jesus had spoken to indicate by what manner of death He was going to die.
JHN.18.33	So Pilate went into the Praetorium again, and called Jesus and asked Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” 
JHN.18.34	Jesus replied, 
JHN.18.35	Pilate answered, “I am not a Jew, am I? Your own people and their chief priests have handed You over to me. What have You done [that is worthy of death]?” 
JHN.18.36	Jesus replied, 
JHN.18.37	So Pilate said to Him, “Then You are a King?” Jesus answered, 
JHN.18.38	Pilate said to Him [scornfully], “What is truth?”
JHN.18.39	But you have a custom that I release someone for you at the Passover. So shall I release for you the King of the Jews?” 
JHN.18.40	Then they all shouted back again, “Not this Man, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a 
JHN.19.1	So then Pilate took Jesus and had Him 
JHN.19.2	And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and put a purple robe around Him; 
JHN.19.3	and they kept coming up to Him, saying [mockingly], “Hail, King of the Jews [Good health! Peace! Long life to you, King of the Jews]!” And they slapped Him 
JHN.19.4	Then Pilate came out again and said to them, “Look, I am bringing Him out to you so that you may know that I find no guilt in Him [no crime, no cause for an accusation].” 
JHN.19.5	So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, and 
JHN.19.6	When the chief priests and officers saw Him, they shouted, “Crucify [Him]! Crucify [Him]!” Pilate said to them, “Take Him yourselves and crucify Him, for I find no guilt in Him [no crime, no cause for an accusation].” 
JHN.19.7	The Jews answered him, “We have a law [regarding blasphemy], and according to that law He should die, because He made Himself out to be the Son of God.”
JHN.19.8	So when Pilate heard this said, he was [even] more 
JHN.19.9	He went into the Praetorium again and said to Jesus, “Where are You from?” But Jesus did not answer him. 
JHN.19.10	So Pilate said to Him, “You do not speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to release You, and I have authority to crucify You?” 
JHN.19.11	Jesus answered, 
JHN.19.12	As a result of this, Pilate kept making efforts to release Him, but the Jews kept screaming, “
JHN.19.13	When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called 
JHN.19.14	Now it was the day of Preparation for the 
JHN.19.15	But they shouted, “Away with 
JHN.19.16	Then he handed Him over to them to be crucified.
JHN.19.17	So they took Jesus, and He went out, 
JHN.19.18	There they crucified Him, and with Him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them. 
JHN.19.19	Pilate also wrote an inscription [on a placard] and put it on the cross. And it was written: “JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.” 
JHN.19.20	And many of the Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. 
JHN.19.21	Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews’; but, ‘He said, “I am King of the Jews.” ’ ” 
JHN.19.22	Pilate replied, “What I have written I have written [and it remains written].”
JHN.19.23	Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His outer clothes and made four parts, a part for each soldier, and also the tunic. But the 
JHN.19.24	So they said to one another, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, 
JHN.19.25	So the soldiers did these things.
JHN.19.26	So Jesus, seeing His mother, and the 
JHN.19.27	Then He said to the disciple (John), 
JHN.19.28	After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said in fulfillment of the Scripture, 
JHN.19.29	A jar full of 
JHN.19.30	When Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, 
JHN.19.31	Since it was the day of Preparation [for the Sabbath], in order to prevent the bodies from hanging on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high holy day) the Jews asked Pilate to have their legs 
JHN.19.32	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man, and of the other who had been crucified with Him. 
JHN.19.33	But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs. 
JHN.19.34	But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came [flowing] out. 
JHN.19.35	And he (John, the eyewitness) who has seen it has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also [who read this] may believe. 
JHN.19.36	For these things took place to fulfill the Scripture, “N
JHN.19.37	And again another Scripture says, “T
JHN.19.38	And after this, Joseph of Arimathea—a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews—asked Pilate to let him take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away His body. 
JHN.19.39	Nicodemus, who had first come to Him at night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, [weighing] about a hundred [Roman] 
JHN.19.40	So they took Jesus’ body and bound it in linen wrappings with the fragrant spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews. 
JHN.19.41	Now there was a garden at the place where He was crucified, and in the garden a new tomb [cut out of solid rock] in which no one had yet been laid. 
JHN.19.42	Therefore, because of the Jewish day of Preparation, and since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.
JHN.20.1	Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw the stone [already] removed from the [groove across the entrance of the] tomb. 
JHN.20.2	So she ran and went to Simon Peter and to the 
JHN.20.3	So Peter and the other disciple left, and they were going to the tomb. 
JHN.20.4	And the two were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and arrived at the tomb first. 
JHN.20.5	Stooping down and looking in, he saw the linen 
JHN.20.6	Then Simon Peter came up, following him, and went into the tomb and saw the linen wrappings [neatly] lying 
JHN.20.7	and the [burial] 
JHN.20.8	So the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, went in too; and he saw [the wrappings and the face-cloth] and 
JHN.20.9	For as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that He must rise from the dead. 
JHN.20.10	Then the disciples went back again to their own homes.
JHN.20.11	But Mary [who had returned] was standing outside the tomb sobbing; and so, as she wept, she stooped down and looked into the tomb; 
JHN.20.12	and she saw two angels in white sitting 
JHN.20.13	And they said to her, “Woman, why are you crying?” She told them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him.” 
JHN.20.14	After saying this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing 
JHN.20.15	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.20.16	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.20.17	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.20.18	Mary Magdalene came, reporting to the disciples that she had seen the Lord and that He had said these things to her.
JHN.20.19	So when it was evening on that 
JHN.20.20	After He said this, He showed them His hands and His side. When the disciples saw the Lord, they were filled with great joy. 
JHN.20.21	Then Jesus said to them again, 
JHN.20.22	And when He said this, He breathed on them and said to them, 
JHN.20.23	 [because of their faith]; 
JHN.20.24	But Thomas, one of the twelve [disciples], who was called Didymus (the twin), was not with them when Jesus came. 
JHN.20.25	So the other disciples kept telling him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to them, “Unless I see in His hands the marks of the nails, and put my finger into the nail prints, and put my hand into His side, I will never believe.”
JHN.20.26	Eight days later His disciples were again inside 
JHN.20.27	Then He said to Thomas, 
JHN.20.28	Thomas answered Him, “My Lord and my God!” 
JHN.20.29	Jesus said to him, 
JHN.20.30	There are also many other signs (attesting miracles) that Jesus performed in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; 
JHN.20.31	but these have been written so that you may believe [with a deep, abiding trust] that Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed), the Son of God; and that by believing [and trusting in and relying on Him] you may have life in His name.
JHN.21.1	After this Jesus revealed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias (Galilee). And He did it in this way: 
JHN.21.2	Simon Peter, and Thomas who is called Didymus (the twin), and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee, as well as [John and James] the sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together. 
JHN.21.3	Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing.” They said, “And we are coming with you.” So they went out and got into the boat; and 
JHN.21.4	As morning was breaking, Jesus [came and] stood on the beach; however, the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. 
JHN.21.5	So Jesus said to them, 
JHN.21.6	And He said to them, 
JHN.21.7	Then that disciple (John) whom Jesus loved (esteemed) said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer tunic (for he was stripped 
JHN.21.8	But the other disciples came in the small boat, for they were not far from shore, only about a hundred yards away, dragging the net full of fish.
JHN.21.9	So when they got out on the beach, they saw a charcoal fire set up and fish on it 
JHN.21.10	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.21.11	So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net to land, full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three [of them]; and although there were so many, the net was not torn.
JHN.21.12	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.21.13	Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and likewise the fish. 
JHN.21.14	This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to the disciples, after He had risen from the dead.
JHN.21.15	So when they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, 
JHN.21.16	Again He said to him a second time, 
JHN.21.17	He said to him the third time, 
JHN.21.19	Now He said this to indicate the 
JHN.21.20	Peter turned and saw the 
JHN.21.21	So when Peter saw him, he asked Jesus, “Lord, and what about this 
JHN.21.22	Jesus said to him, 
JHN.21.23	So this word went out among the brothers that this disciple (John) was not going to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not going to die, but 
JHN.21.24	This is the 
JHN.21.25	And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they were recorded 
ACT.1.1	The first 
ACT.1.2	until the day when He ascended 
ACT.1.3	To these [men] He also showed Himself alive after His suffering [in Gethsemane and on the cross], by [a series of] many infallible proofs 
ACT.1.4	While being together 
ACT.1.6	So when they had come together, they asked Him 
ACT.1.7	He said to them, 
ACT.1.8	 [to tell people about Me] 
ACT.1.9	And after He said these things, He was caught up as they looked on, and a cloud took Him up out of their sight. 
ACT.1.10	While they were looking intently into the sky as He was going, two men in white clothing suddenly stood beside them, 
ACT.1.11	who said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This [same] Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will return in just the same way as you have watched Him go into heaven.”
ACT.1.12	Then the disciples returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet (Olive Grove), which is near Jerusalem, [only] a Sabbath day’s journey (less than one mile) away. 
ACT.1.13	When they had entered 
ACT.1.14	All these with one mind 
ACT.1.15	Now on one of these days Peter stood up among the brothers and sisters (a gathering of about a hundred and twenty believers was there) and he said, 
ACT.1.16	“Brothers and sisters, it was necessary that the Scripture be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit foretold by the lips of David [king of Israel] about Judas [Iscariot], who acted as guide to those who arrested Jesus. 
ACT.1.17	For he (Judas) was counted among us and received his share [by divine allotment] in this ministry.” 
ACT.1.18	(Now Judas Iscariot 
ACT.1.19	All the people in Jerusalem learned about this, so in their own dialect—Aramaic—they called the piece of land Hakeldama, that is, Field of Blood.) 
ACT.1.20	“For in the book of Psalms it is written,
ACT.1.20	‘L
ACT.1.20	A

ACT.1.21	So of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus spent with us, 
ACT.1.22	beginning with the baptism by John [at the outset of Jesus’ ministry] until the day when He was taken up from us—one of these men 
ACT.1.23	And they put forward two men, Joseph, the one called Barsabbas (who was surnamed Justus), and Matthias. 
ACT.1.24	They prayed and said, “You, Lord, who know all hearts [their thoughts, motives, desires], show us which one of these two You have chosen 
ACT.1.25	to occupy this ministry and apostleship which Judas left to go to his own place [of evil].” 
ACT.1.26	And they

ACT.2.3	There appeared to them tongues resembling fire, which were being distributed [among them], and they rested on each one of them [as each person received the Holy Spirit]. 
ACT.2.4	And they were all filled [that is, diffused throughout their being] with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other 
ACT.2.5	Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout 
ACT.2.6	And when this sound was heard, a crowd gathered, and they were bewildered because each one was hearing those in the upper room speaking in his own language 
ACT.2.7	They were completely astonished, saying, “Look! Are not all of these who are speaking Galileans? 
ACT.2.8	Then how is it that each of us hears in our own language 
ACT.2.9	[Among us there are] Parthians, Medes and Elamites, and people of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and 
ACT.2.10	Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the districts of Libya around Cyrene, and the visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes (Gentile converts to Judaism), 
ACT.2.11	Cretans and Arabs—we all hear them speaking in our [native] tongues about the mighty works of God!” 
ACT.2.12	And they were beside themselves with amazement and were greatly perplexed, saying one to another, “What could this mean?” 
ACT.2.13	But others were laughing 
ACT.2.14	But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed them: “Men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem, let this be explained to you; listen closely 
ACT.2.15	These people are not drunk, as you assume, since it is [only] the third hour of the day (9:00 a.m.);

ACT.2.36	Therefore let all the house of Israel recognize beyond all doubt that God has made Him both Lord and Christ (Messiah, Anointed)—this Jesus whom you crucified.”
ACT.2.37	Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart [with remorse and anxiety], and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what are we to do?” 
ACT.2.38	And Peter said to them, “Repent [change your old way of thinking, turn from your sinful ways, accept and follow Jesus as the Messiah] and be baptized, each of you, in the name of Jesus Christ because of the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 
ACT.2.39	For the promise [of the Holy Spirit] is for you and your children and for all who are far away [including the Gentiles], as many as the Lord our God calls to Himself.” 
ACT.2.40	And Peter solemnly testified and continued to admonish 
ACT.2.41	So then, those who accepted his message were baptized; and on that day about 
ACT.2.42	They were continually 
ACT.2.43	A sense of awe was felt by 
ACT.2.44	And all those who had believed [in Jesus as Savior] 
ACT.2.45	And they 
ACT.2.46	Day after day they met in the temple [area] continuing with one mind, and breaking bread in various private homes. They were eating their meals together with joy and generous hearts, 
ACT.2.47	praising God 
ACT.3.1	Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour (3:00 p.m.), 
ACT.3.2	and a man who had been unable to walk from birth was being carried along, whom they used to set down every day at that gate of the temple which is called 
ACT.3.3	So when he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he 
ACT.3.4	But Peter, along with John, stared at him intently and said, “Look at us!” 
ACT.3.5	And the man 
ACT.3.6	But Peter said, “Silver and gold I do not have; but what I do have I give to you: In the name (authority, power) of Jesus Christ the Nazarene—[begin now to] walk 
ACT.3.7	Then he seized the man’s right hand with a firm grip and raised him up. And at once his feet and ankles became strong 
ACT.3.8	and with a leap he stood up and 
ACT.3.9	All the people saw him walking and praising God; 
ACT.3.10	and they recognized him as the very man who usually sat 
ACT.3.11	Now while he was still holding on to Peter and John, all the people, utterly amazed, ran together 
ACT.3.12	And Peter, seeing this, said to the people, “You men of Israel, why are you amazed at this? Why are you staring at us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk? 
ACT.3.13	The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His Servant 
ACT.3.14	But you disowned 
ACT.3.15	But you killed the Prince (Author, Originator, Source) of life, whom God raised [bodily] from the dead. To this [fact] we are witnesses [for we have seen the risen Christ]. 
ACT.3.16	And on the basis of faith in His name, it is the name of Jesus which has strengthened this man whom you see and know; and the faith which

ACT.3.18	And so God has fulfilled what He foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that His Christ (Messiah, Anointed) would suffer. 
ACT.3.19	So repent [change your inner self—your old way of thinking, regret past sins] and return [to God—seek His purpose for your life], so that your sins may be wiped away [blotted out, completely erased], so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord [restoring you like a cool wind on a hot day]; 
ACT.3.20	and that He may send [to you] Jesus, the Christ, who has been appointed for you,

ACT.4.1	And while Peter and John were talking to the people, the priests and the captain [who was in charge of the temple area and] of the temple 
ACT.4.2	being extremely disturbed 
ACT.4.3	So they arrested them and put them in jail until the next day, because it was evening. 
ACT.4.4	But many of those who heard the message [of salvation] believed [in Jesus and accepted Him as the Christ]. And the number of the men came to be about 5,000.
ACT.4.5	On the next day, their magistrates and elders and scribes (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court) were gathered together in Jerusalem; 
ACT.4.6	and 
ACT.4.7	When they had put the men in 
ACT.4.8	Then Peter, filled with [the power of] the Holy Spirit, said to them, “Rulers and elders of the people [members of the Sanhedrin, the Jewish High Court], 
ACT.4.9	if we are being put on trial today [to interrogate us] for a good deed done to [benefit] a disabled man, as to how this man has been restored to health, 
ACT.4.10	let it be known 
ACT.4.11	This Jesus is the 
ACT.4.12	And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among people by which we must be saved [for God has provided the world no alternative for salvation].”
ACT.4.13	Now when the men of the Sanhedrin (Jewish High Court) saw the confidence 
ACT.4.14	And seeing the man who had been healed standing 
ACT.4.15	But after ordering them to step out of the Council [chamber], they 
ACT.4.16	saying, “What are we to do with these men? For the fact that an extraordinary miracle has taken place through them is public knowledge 
ACT.4.17	But to keep it from spreading further among the people 
ACT.4.18	So they sent for them, and commanded them not to speak [as His representatives] or teach at all in the name of Jesus [using Him as their authority]. 
ACT.4.19	But Peter and John replied to them, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you 
ACT.4.20	for we, on our part, cannot stop telling [people] about what we have seen and heard.” 
ACT.4.21	When the rulers and Council members had threatened them further, they let them go, finding no way to punish them because [of their fear] of the people, for they were all praising 
ACT.4.22	for the man to whom this sign (attesting miracle) of healing had happened was more than forty years old.
ACT.4.23	After Peter and John were released, they returned to their own [people] and reported everything that the chief priests and elders had said to them. 
ACT.4.24	And when they heard it, they raised their voices together to God and said, “O Sovereign Lord [having complete power and authority], it is You who 
ACT.4.25	who by the Holy Spirit,

ACT.4.26	A
ACT.4.27	For in this city there were gathered together against Your holy Servant Jesus, whom You anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, 
ACT.4.28	to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose predestined [before the creation of the world] to occur [and so without knowing it, they served Your own purpose]. 
ACT.4.29	And now, Lord, observe their threats [take them into account] and grant that Your bond-servants may declare Your message [of salvation] with great confidence, 
ACT.4.30	while You extend Your hand to heal, and signs and wonders (attesting miracles) take place through the name [and the authority and power] of Your holy Servant 
ACT.4.31	And when they had prayed, the place where they were meeting together was shaken [a sign of God’s presence]; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and 
ACT.4.32	Now the company of believers was of one heart and soul, and not one [of them] claimed that anything belonging to him was [exclusively] his own, but everything was common property 
ACT.4.33	And with great ability 
ACT.4.34	There was not a needy person among them, because those who were owners of land or houses were selling them, and bringing the proceeds of the sales 
ACT.4.35	and placing 
ACT.4.36	Now Joseph, a Levite and native of Cyprus, who was surnamed 
ACT.4.37	sold a field belonging to him and brought the money and set it at the apostles’ feet.
ACT.5.1	Now a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property, 
ACT.5.2	and with his wife’s full knowledge [and complicity] he kept back some of the proceeds, bringing only a 
ACT.5.3	But Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and [secretly] keep back for yourself some of the proceeds [from the sale] of the land? 
ACT.5.4	As long as it remained [unsold], did it not remain your own [to do with as you pleased]? And after it was sold, was the money not under your control? Why is it that you have conceived this act [of hypocrisy and deceit] in your heart? You have not [simply] lied to people, but to God.” 
ACT.5.5	And hearing these words, Ananias fell down suddenly and died; and great fear 
ACT.5.6	And the young men [in the congregation] got up and wrapped up the body, and carried it out and buried it.
ACT.5.7	Now after an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. 
ACT.5.8	Peter asked her, “Tell me whether you sold your land for so much?” And she said, “Yes, for so much.” 
ACT.5.9	Then Peter said to her, “How could you two have agreed together to put the Spirit of the Lord to the test? Look! The feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also.” 
ACT.5.10	And at once she fell down at his feet and died; and the young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. 
ACT.5.11	And great fear 
ACT.5.12	At the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders (attesting miracles) were 
ACT.5.13	But none of the rest [of the people, the non-believers] dared to associate with them; however, the people were holding them in high esteem 
ACT.5.14	More 
ACT.5.15	to such an extent that they even carried their sick out into the streets and put them on cots and sleeping pads, so that when Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on one of them [with healing power]. 
ACT.5.16	And the people from the towns in the vicinity of Jerusalem were coming together, bringing the sick and those who were tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all being healed.
ACT.5.17	But the 
ACT.5.18	They arrested the apostles and put them in a public jail. 
ACT.5.19	But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors, and leading them out, he said, 
ACT.5.20	“Go, stand and 
ACT.5.21	When they heard this, they went into the temple [courtyards] about daybreak and 
ACT.5.22	But when the officers arrived, they did not find them in the prison; and they came back and reported, 
ACT.5.23	“We found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened [the doors], we found no one inside.” 
ACT.5.24	Now when the captain of the temple 
ACT.5.25	But someone came and told them, “The men whom you put in prison are standing [right here] in the temple [area], teaching the people!” 
ACT.5.26	Then the captain went with the officers and brought them back, without hurting them (because they were afraid of the people, worried that they might be stoned).
ACT.5.27	So they brought them and presented them before the Council (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court). The high priest questioned them, 
ACT.5.28	saying, “We gave you strict orders not to continue teaching in this name, and yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and you intend to bring this 
ACT.5.29	Then Peter and the apostles replied, “We must obey God rather than men [we have no other choice]. 
ACT.5.30	The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you had put to death by hanging Him on a 
ACT.5.31	God exalted Him to His right hand as Prince and Savior 
ACT.5.32	And we are witnesses of these things; and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has bestowed on those who obey Him.”
ACT.5.33	Now when they heard this, they were infuriated and they intended to kill the apostles. 
ACT.5.34	But a Pharisee named 
ACT.5.35	Then he said to the Council, “Men of Israel, be careful in regard to what you propose to do to these men. 
ACT.5.36	For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody [of importance], and a group of about four hundred men allied themselves with him. But he was killed, and all who followed him were scattered and came to nothing. 
ACT.5.37	After this man, Judas the Galilean rose up, [and led an uprising] during the time of the census, and drew people after him; he was also killed, and all his followers were scattered. 
ACT.5.38	So in the present case, I say to you, stay away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or action is of men [merely human in origin], it will fail 
ACT.5.39	but if it is of God [and it appears that it is], you will not be able to stop them; or else you may even be found fighting against God!”
ACT.5.40	The Council (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court) took his advice; and after summoning the apostles, they flogged them and ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and released them. 
ACT.5.41	So they left the Council, rejoicing that they had been considered worthy [dignified by indignity] to suffer shame for [the sake of] His name. 
ACT.5.42	And every single day, in the temple [area] and in homes, they did not stop teaching and telling the good news of Jesus as the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed).
ACT.6.1	Now about this time, when the number of disciples was increasing, a complaint was made by the 
ACT.6.2	So the 
ACT.6.3	Therefore, brothers, choose from among you seven men with good reputations [men of godly character and moral integrity], full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may put in charge of this task. 
ACT.6.4	But we will [continue to] devote ourselves [steadfastly] to prayer and to the ministry of the word.” 
ACT.6.5	The suggestion pleased the whole congregation; and they selected 
ACT.6.6	They brought these men before the apostles; and after praying, they laid their hands on them [to dedicate and commission them for this service].
ACT.6.7	And the message of God kept on growing 
ACT.6.8	Now Stephen, full of grace (divine blessing, favor) and power, was doing great wonders and signs (attesting miracles) among the people. 
ACT.6.9	However, some men from what was called the Synagogue of the Freedmen (freed Jewish slaves), both Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and some from Cilicia and [the province of] Asia, rose up and questioned 
ACT.6.10	But they were not able to successfully withstand 
ACT.6.11	Then [to attack him another way] they secretly instructed men to say, “We have heard this man [Stephen] speak blasphemous (slanderous, sacrilegious, abusive) words against Moses and 
ACT.6.12	And they provoked 
ACT.6.13	They presented false witnesses who said, “This man never stops speaking against this holy place and the Law [of Moses]; 
ACT.6.14	for we have heard him say that this Jesus the Nazarene will tear down this place and will change the traditions 
ACT.6.15	Then all those who were sitting in the Council, stared [intently] at him, and they saw that Stephen’s face was like the face of an angel.
ACT.7.1	Now the 
ACT.7.2	And he answered, “Brothers and fathers, listen to me! The God of glory [the Shekinah, the radiance of God] appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,

ACT.7.9	“The [ten elder] patriarchs, 
ACT.7.10	and He rescued him from all his suffering, and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he made Joseph governor over Egypt and over his entire household.
ACT.7.11	“Now a famine came over all Egypt and Canaan, bringing great distress and our fathers could not find food [for their households and livestock]. 
ACT.7.12	But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers 
ACT.7.13	And on the second 
ACT.7.14	Then Joseph sent and invited Jacob his father and all his relatives to come to him, seventy-five persons in all. 
ACT.7.15	And Jacob (Israel) went down into Egypt, and 
ACT.7.16	and [from Egypt] 
ACT.7.17	“But as the time [for the fulfillment] of the promise which God had made to Abraham was approaching, the [Hebrew] people increased and multiplied in Egypt,

ACT.7.20	It was at this [critical] time that Moses was born; and he was lovely in the sight of God, and for three months he was nourished in his father’s house. 
ACT.7.21	Then when he was set outside [to die], Pharaoh’s daughter rescued him 
ACT.7.22	So Moses was educated in all the wisdom 
ACT.7.23	But when he reached the age of forty, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the sons of Israel. 
ACT.7.24	And when he saw one [of them] being treated unfairly, he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking 
ACT.7.25	He expected his countrymen to understand that God was granting them freedom through him [assuming that they would accept him], but they did not understand. 
ACT.7.26	Then on the next day he suddenly appeared to two of them as they were fighting, and he tried to reconcile them, saying, ‘Men, you are brothers; why do you wrong one another?’

ACT.7.58	Then they drove him out of the city and 
ACT.7.59	They continued stoning Stephen as he called on 
ACT.7.60	Then falling on his knees [in worship], he cried out loudly, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them [do not charge them]!” When he had said this, he fell asleep [in death].

ACT.8.4	Now those [believers] who had been scattered went from place to place preaching the word [the good news of salvation through Christ]. 
ACT.8.5	Philip [the evangelist] went down to the city of Samaria and 
ACT.8.6	The crowds gathered and were paying close attention to everything Philip said, as they heard [the message] and saw the [miraculous] signs which he was doing [validating his message]. 
ACT.8.7	For unclean spirits (demons), shouting loudly, were coming out of many who were possessed; and many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed. 
ACT.8.8	So there was great rejoicing in that city.
ACT.8.9	Now there was a man named Simon, who previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great. 
ACT.8.10	They all paid [a great deal of] attention to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, “This man is what is called the Great Power of God!” 
ACT.8.11	They were paying attention to him because for a long time he had mystified 
ACT.8.12	But when they believed Philip as he preached the 
ACT.8.13	Even Simon believed [Philip’s message of salvation]; and after being baptized, he continued on with Philip, and as he watched the 
ACT.8.14	When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that [the people of] Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them. 
ACT.8.15	They came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit; 
ACT.8.16	for He had not yet fallen on any of them; they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus [as His possession]. 
ACT.8.17	Then Peter and John laid their hands on them [one by one], and they received the Holy Spirit. 
ACT.8.18	Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money, 
ACT.8.19	saying, “Give me this authority 
ACT.8.20	But Peter said to him, “May your money be destroyed along with you, because you thought you could buy the [free] gift of God with money! 
ACT.8.21	You have no part or share in this matter, because your heart (motive, purpose) is not right before God.

ACT.8.25	So, when Peter and John had given their testimony and preached the word of the Lord, they started back to Jerusalem, preaching the good news [about salvation] in many Samaritan villages [along the way].
ACT.8.26	But an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Get up and go south to the road that runs from Jerusalem down to Gaza.” (This is a desert road). 
ACT.8.27	So he got up and went; and there was an Ethiopian eunuch [a man of great authority], a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure. He had come to Jerusalem to worship, 
ACT.8.28	and he was returning, and sitting in his chariot he was reading [the scroll of] the prophet Isaiah. 
ACT.8.29	Then the [Holy] Spirit said to Philip, “Go up and join this chariot.” 
ACT.8.30	Philip ran up and heard the man reading the prophet Isaiah, and asked, “Do you understand what you are reading?” 
ACT.8.31	And he said, “Well, how could I [understand] unless someone guides me [correctly]?” And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. 
ACT.8.32	Now this was the passage of Scripture which he was reading:
ACT.8.32	“L
ACT.8.32	A
ACT.8.32	S
ACT.8.33	I
ACT.8.33	W
ACT.8.33	F
ACT.8.34	The eunuch replied to Philip, “Please 
ACT.8.35	Then Philip spoke and beginning with this Scripture he preached Jesus to him [explaining that He is the promised Messiah and the source of salvation]. 
ACT.8.36	As they continued along the road, they came to some water; and the eunuch exclaimed, “Look! Water! What forbids me from being baptized?” 
ACT.8.37	Philip said to him, “If you believe with all your heart, you may.” And he replied, “I do believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”
ACT.8.38	And he ordered that the chariot be stopped; and both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and Philip baptized him. 
ACT.8.39	When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord [suddenly] took Philip [and carried him] away [to a different place]; and the eunuch no longer saw him, but he went on his way rejoicing. 
ACT.8.40	But Philip found himself at 
ACT.9.1	Now 
ACT.9.2	and he asked for letters [of authority] from him to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any men or women there belonging to 
ACT.9.3	As he traveled he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him [displaying the glory and majesty of Christ]; 
ACT.9.4	and he fell to the ground and heard a voice [from heaven] saying to him, 
ACT.9.5	And Saul said, “Who are You, Lord?” And He 
ACT.9.7	The men who were traveling with him [were terrified and] stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one. 
ACT.9.8	Saul got up from the ground, but though his eyes were open, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. 
ACT.9.9	And he was unable to see for three days, and he neither ate nor drank.
ACT.9.10	Now in Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, 
ACT.9.11	And the Lord said to him, 
ACT.9.13	But Ananias answered, “Lord, I have heard from many people about this man, especially how much suffering 
ACT.9.14	and here [in Damascus] he has authority from the high priests to put in chains all who call on Your name [confessing You as Savior].” 
ACT.9.15	But the Lord said to him, 
ACT.9.17	So Ananias left and entered the house, and he laid his hands on Saul and said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came [to Damascus], has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit [in order to proclaim Christ to both Jews and Gentiles].” 
ACT.9.18	Immediately something like scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and he regained his sight. Then he got up and was baptized; 
ACT.9.19	and he took some food and was strengthened.
ACT.9.20	And immediately he 
ACT.9.21	All those who heard him continued to be amazed and said, “Is this not the man who in Jerusalem attacked those who called on this name [of Jesus], and had come here [to Damascus] for the express purpose of bringing them bound [with chains] before the chief priests?” 
ACT.9.22	But Saul increased in strength more and more, and continued to perplex the Jews who lived in Damascus by examining [theological evidence] 
ACT.9.23	After considerable time had passed [about three years or so], the Jews plotted together to kill him, 
ACT.9.24	but their plot became known to Saul. They were also watching the city’s gates day and night so they could kill him; 
ACT.9.25	but his disciples took him at night and let him down through 
ACT.9.26	When he arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple. 
ACT.9.27	However, 
ACT.9.28	So he was with them, moving around freely [as one among them] in Jerusalem, speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord. 
ACT.9.29	He was talking and arguing with the 
ACT.9.30	When the brothers found out [about the plot], they brought him down to 
ACT.9.31	So the church throughout Judea and Galilee and Samaria enjoyed peace [without persecution], being built up [in wisdom, virtue, and faith]; and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort 
ACT.9.32	Now as Peter was traveling throughout 
ACT.9.33	There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years and was paralyzed. 
ACT.9.34	Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and make your bed.” Immediately Aeneas got up. 
ACT.9.35	Then all who lived at Lydda and 
ACT.9.36	Now in 
ACT.9.37	During that time it happened that she became sick and died; and when they had washed her body, they laid it in an upstairs room. 
ACT.9.38	Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, urging him, “Come to us without delay.” 
ACT.9.39	So Peter got up [at once] and went with them. When he arrived, they brought him into the upstairs room; and all the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing [him] all the 
ACT.9.40	But Peter sent them all out [of the room] and knelt down and prayed; then turning to the body he said, “Tabitha, arise!” And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up. 
ACT.9.41	And he gave her his hand and helped her up; and then he called in the 
ACT.9.42	This became known all over Joppa, and many came to believe in the Lord [that is, to adhere to and trust in and rely on Jesus as Christ and Savior]. 
ACT.9.43	And so it was that Peter stayed in Joppa for many days with Simon, 
ACT.10.1	Now at 
ACT.10.2	a devout man and one who, along with all his household, feared God. He made many charitable donations to the 
ACT.10.3	About the ninth hour (3:00 p.m.) of the day he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God who had come to him and said, “Cornelius!” 
ACT.10.4	Cornelius was frightened and stared intently at him and said, “What is it, lord (sir)?” And the angel said to him, “Your prayers and gifts of charity have ascended as a memorial offering before God [an offering made in remembrance of His past blessings]. 
ACT.10.5	Now send men to 
ACT.10.6	he is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea.” 
ACT.10.7	When the angel who was speaking to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among his own personal attendants; 
ACT.10.8	and after explaining everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.
ACT.10.9	The next day, as they were on their way and were approaching the city, Peter went up on 
ACT.10.10	but he became hungry and wanted something to eat. While 
ACT.10.11	and he saw the sky opened up, and an 
ACT.10.12	and it contained all 
ACT.10.13	A voice came to him, “Get up, Peter, kill and eat!” 
ACT.10.14	But Peter said, “Not at all, Lord, for I have never eaten anything that is common (unholy) and [ceremonially] unclean.” 
ACT.10.15	And the voice came to him a second time, “What God has cleansed 
ACT.10.16	This happened three times, and then immediately the object was taken up into heaven.
ACT.10.17	Now Peter was still perplexed 
ACT.10.18	And they called out to ask whether Simon, who was also called Peter, was staying there. 
ACT.10.19	While Peter was thoughtfully considering the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Now listen, three men are looking for you. 
ACT.10.20	Get up, go downstairs and go with them without hesitating 
ACT.10.21	Peter went down to the men and said, “I am the one you are looking for. For what reason have you come?” 
ACT.10.22	They said, “Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man well spoken of by all the Jewish people, was 
ACT.10.23	So Peter 
ACT.10.24	On the following day he [and the others] entered Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them, and had called together his relatives and close friends. 
ACT.10.25	When Peter arrived, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet and 
ACT.10.26	But Peter raised him up, saying, “Stand up; I too am only a man.” 
ACT.10.27	As Peter talked with him, he entered [the house] and found a large group of people assembled. 
ACT.10.28	He said to them, “You know that it is unlawful for a Jewish man to associate with 
ACT.10.29	Therefore when I was sent for, I came without raising an objection. So I ask for what reason have you sent for me?”
ACT.10.30	Cornelius said, “Four days ago to this hour, I was praying in my house during the ninth hour (3:00-4:00 p.m.); and a man [dressed] in bright, dazzling clothing suddenly stood before me, 
ACT.10.31	and he said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your acts of charity have been remembered before God [so that He is about to help you]. 
ACT.10.32	Therefore send 
ACT.10.33	So I sent for you at once, and you have been kind enough to come. Now then, we are all here present before God to listen to everything that you have been instructed by the Lord [to say].”
ACT.10.34	Opening his mouth, Peter said:
ACT.10.34	“
ACT.10.35	but in every nation the person who fears God and does what is right [by seeking Him] is acceptable 
ACT.10.36	You know the message which He sent to the sons of Israel, announcing 
ACT.10.37	you know the things that have taken place throughout Judea, starting in Galilee after the baptism preached by John— 
ACT.10.38	how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with great power; and He went around doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, because God was with Him. 
ACT.10.39	We are [personally] eyewitnesses of everything that He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem [in particular]. They also put Him to death by hanging Him on a cross; 
ACT.10.40	God raised Him [to life] on the third day and caused Him to be plainly seen, 
ACT.10.41	not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen 
ACT.10.42	He commanded us to preach to the people [both Jew and Gentile], and to solemnly testify that He is the One who has been appointed 
ACT.10.43	All the prophets testify about Him, that through His name everyone who believes in Him [whoever trusts in and relies on Him, accepting Him as Savior and Messiah] receives forgiveness of sins.”
ACT.10.44	While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who were listening to the message [confirming God’s acceptance of Gentiles]. 
ACT.10.45	All the circumcised believers who came with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. 
ACT.10.46	For they heard them talking in [unknown] tongues (languages) and exalting 
ACT.10.47	“Can anyone refuse water for these people to be baptized, since they have received the Holy Spirit just as we did?” 
ACT.10.48	And he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay there for a few days.
ACT.11.1	Now the apostles and the believers who were throughout Judea heard [with astonishment] that the Gentiles also had received 
ACT.11.2	So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision [certain Jewish believers who followed the Law] took issue with him [for violating Jewish customs], 
ACT.11.3	saying, “You went to uncircumcised men and [even] ate with them!” 
ACT.11.4	But Peter began [at the beginning] and explained [the events] to them step by step, saying, 
ACT.11.5	“I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision of an object coming down from heaven, like a huge sheet being lowered by the four corners; and [it descended until] it came right down to me, 
ACT.11.6	and looking closely at it, I saw 
ACT.11.7	and I also heard a voice saying to me, ‘Get up, Peter; kill and eat.’ 
ACT.11.8	But I said, ‘Not at all, Lord; for nothing common (unholy) or [ceremonially] unclean has ever entered my mouth.’ 
ACT.11.9	But the voice from heaven answered a second time, ‘What God has cleansed 
ACT.11.10	This happened three times, and everything was drawn up again into heaven. 
ACT.11.11	And right then the three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea arrived at the house where we were 
ACT.11.12	The Spirit told me to go with them without the slightest hesitation. So these six brothers also went with me and we went to the man’s house. 
ACT.11.13	And Cornelius told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, saying, ‘Send 
ACT.11.14	he will bring a message to you by which you will be saved [and granted eternal life], you and all your household.’ 
ACT.11.15	When I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as 
ACT.11.16	Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He used to say, 
ACT.11.17	So, if God gave Gentiles the same gift [equally] as He gave us after we accepted 
ACT.11.18	When they heard this, they quieted down and glorified 
ACT.11.19	So then [since they were unaware of these developments] those who were scattered because of the persecution that occurred in connection with [the stoning of] Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, without telling the message [of salvation through Christ] to anyone except Jews. 
ACT.11.20	But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who came to Antioch and 
ACT.11.21	And the hand (the power and presence) of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord [for salvation, accepting and drawing near to Jesus as Messiah and Savior]. 
ACT.11.22	The news of this reached the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. 
ACT.11.23	When he arrived and saw the grace of God [that was bestowed on them], he rejoiced and 
ACT.11.24	For Barnabas was a good man [privately and publicly—his godly character benefited both himself and others] and 
ACT.11.25	And Barnabas left for Tarsus to search for Saul; 
ACT.11.26	and when he found him, he brought him back to Antioch. For an entire year they met [with others] in the church and instructed large numbers; and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians.
ACT.11.27	Now at this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 
ACT.11.28	One of them named Agabus stood up and prophesied through the [Holy] Spirit that a severe famine would come on the 
ACT.11.29	So the disciples decided to send 
ACT.11.30	And this they did, sending the contribution to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.
ACT.12.1	Now at that time 
ACT.12.2	And he had James the brother of John put to death with a sword; 
ACT.12.3	and when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to have Peter arrested as well. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread [the Passover week]. 
ACT.12.4	When he had seized Peter, he put him in prison, turning him over to four squads of soldiers of four each to guard him [in rotation throughout the night], planning after the Passover to bring him out before the people [for execution]. 
ACT.12.5	So Peter was kept in prison, but fervent 
ACT.12.6	The very night before Herod was to bring him forward, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries were in front of the door guarding the prison. 
ACT.12.7	Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared [beside him] and a light shone in the cell. The angel struck Peter’s side and awakened him, saying, “Get up quickly!” And the chains fell off his hands. 
ACT.12.8	The angel said to him, “Prepare yourself and strap on your sandals [to get ready for whatever may happen].” And he did so. Then the angel told him, “Put on your robe and follow me.” 
ACT.12.9	And Peter went out following 
ACT.12.10	When they had passed the first guard and the second, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city. Of its own accord it swung open for them; and they went out and went along one street, and at once the angel left him. 
ACT.12.11	When Peter came to his senses, he said, “Now I know for certain that the Lord has sent His angel and has rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting [to do to me].” 
ACT.12.12	When he realized what had happened, he went to the house of 
ACT.12.13	When he knocked at the door of the gateway, a servant-girl named Rhoda came to answer. 
ACT.12.14	Recognizing Peter’s voice, in her joy she failed to open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter was standing in front of the gateway. 
ACT.12.15	They said to her, “You are out of your mind!” But she kept insisting that it was so. They kept saying, “It is his angel!” 
ACT.12.16	But [meanwhile] Peter continued knocking; and when they opened 
ACT.12.17	But motioning to them with his hand to be quiet 
ACT.12.18	Now when day came, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers over what had become of Peter. 
ACT.12.19	When Herod had searched for him and could not find him, he interrogated the guards and commanded that they be led away 
ACT.12.20	Now Herod [Agrippa I] was 
ACT.12.21	On an appointed day Herod dressed himself in his 
ACT.12.22	The assembled people kept shouting, “It is the voice of a god and not of a man!” 
ACT.12.23	And at once an angel of the Lord struck him down because he did not give God the glory [and instead permitted himself to be worshiped], and 
ACT.12.24	But the word of the Lord [the good news about salvation through Christ] continued to grow and spread [increasing in effectiveness].
ACT.12.25	Barnabas and Saul came back 
ACT.13.1	Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets [who spoke a new message of God to the people] and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called 
ACT.13.2	While they were serving the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul (Paul) for the work to which I have called them.” 
ACT.13.3	Then after fasting and praying, they laid their hands on them [in approval and dedication] and sent them away [on their first journey].
ACT.13.4	So then, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus. 
ACT.13.5	When Barnabas and Saul arrived at Salamis, they 
ACT.13.6	When they had traveled through the entire island [of Cyprus] as far as Paphos, they found a sorcerer, a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus, 
ACT.13.7	who was [closely associated] with the 
ACT.13.8	But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is how his name is translated) opposed them, trying to turn the proconsul away from 
ACT.13.9	But 
ACT.13.10	and said, “
ACT.13.11	Now, watch! The hand of the Lord is on you, and you will be blind, [so blind that you will be] unable to see the sun for a time.” Immediately a mist and darkness fell upon him, and he groped around, seeking people to lead him by the hand. 
ACT.13.12	The proconsul believed [the message of salvation] when he saw what had happened, being astonished at the teaching concerning the Lord.
ACT.13.13	Now Paul and his companions sailed from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia; but 
ACT.13.14	Now they went on from Perga and arrived at Antioch in Pisidia, and on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down. 
ACT.13.15	After the reading of the Law and the [writings of the] Prophets, the officials of the synagogue sent 
ACT.13.16	So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand, he said,
ACT.13.16	“
ACT.13.17	The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great 
ACT.13.18	For a period of about forty years He put up with their behavior in the wilderness. 
ACT.13.19	When He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He gave their land [to our ancestors] as an inheritance—this took about four hundred and fifty years. 
ACT.13.20	After this, He gave 
ACT.13.21	Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. 
ACT.13.22	And when He had removed him, He raised up David to be their king: of him He testified and said, ‘I 
ACT.13.23	From this man’s descendants God has brought to Israel a Savior, [in the person of] Jesus, according to His promise. 
ACT.13.24	Before 
ACT.13.25	And as John was finishing his course [of ministry], he kept saying, ‘What 
ACT.13.26	“Brothers, sons of Abraham’s family, and those among you who fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation [obtained through faith in Jesus Christ]. 
ACT.13.27	For those who live in Jerusalem, and their rulers, who failed to recognize 
ACT.13.28	And though they found no cause 
ACT.13.29	And when they had finished carrying out everything that was written [in Scripture] about Him, they took Him down from the 
ACT.13.30	But God raised Him from the dead; 
ACT.13.31	and for many days (forty) He appeared to those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, the very ones who are now His witnesses to the people. 
ACT.13.32	And we are bringing you the good news of the promise made to our fathers (ancestors), 
ACT.13.33	that God has 
ACT.13.34	And [as for the fact] that He raised Him from the dead, never again to return to decay [in the grave], He has spoken in this way: ‘I 
ACT.13.35	For this reason He also says in another 
ACT.13.36	For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep and was buried among his fathers and experienced decay [in the grave]; 
ACT.13.37	but He whom God raised [to life] did not experience decay [in the grave]. 
ACT.13.38	So let it be clearly known by you, brothers, that through Him forgiveness of sins is being proclaimed to you; 
ACT.13.39	and through Him everyone who believes [who acknowledges Jesus as Lord and Savior and follows Him] is 
ACT.13.40	Therefore be careful, so that the thing spoken of in the [writings of the] Prophets does not come upon you:
ACT.13.41	‘L
ACT.13.41	F
ACT.13.41	A 
ACT.13.42	As Paul and Barnabas were leaving [the synagogue], the people kept begging that these things might be spoken to them on the next Sabbath. 
ACT.13.43	When the congregation of the synagogue had been dismissed, many of the Jews and the devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who, talking to them were urging them to continue in the grace of God.
ACT.13.44	On the next Sabbath almost the entire 
ACT.13.45	But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and 
ACT.13.46	And [at the same time] Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly 
ACT.13.47	For that is what the Lord has commanded us, saying,
ACT.13.47	‘I 
ACT.13.47	S
ACT.13.48	When the Gentiles heard this, they 
ACT.13.49	And so the word of the Lord [regarding salvation] was being spread through the entire region. 
ACT.13.50	But the Jews incited the devout, prominent women and the leading men of the city, and instigated persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them forcibly out of their district. 
ACT.13.51	But 
ACT.13.52	And the disciples were continually filled [throughout their hearts and souls] with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
ACT.14.1	Now in Iconium Paul and Barnabas went into the Jewish synagogue together and spoke in such a way [with such power and boldness] that a large number of Jews as well as Greeks believed [and confidently accepted Jesus as Savior]; 
ACT.14.2	but the unbelieving Jews [who rejected Jesus as Messiah] stirred up and embittered the minds of the Gentiles against the 
ACT.14.3	So Paul and Barnabas stayed for a long time, speaking boldly 
ACT.14.4	But the people of the city were divided; some were 
ACT.14.5	When there was an attempt by both the Gentiles and the Jews, together with their rulers, to shamefully mistreat and to stone them, 
ACT.14.6	they, aware of the situation, escaped to Lystra and Derbe, [taking refuge in the] cities of Lycaonia, and the neighboring region; 
ACT.14.7	and there they continued to preach the good news.
ACT.14.8	Now at Lystra a man sat who was unable to use his feet, for he was crippled from birth and had never walked. 
ACT.14.9	This man was listening to Paul as he spoke, and Paul looked intently at him and saw that he had faith to be healed, 
ACT.14.10	and said with a loud voice, “Stand up on your feet.” And he jumped up and 
ACT.14.11	And the crowds, when they saw what Paul had done, raised their voices, shouting in the 
ACT.14.12	They began calling Barnabas, Zeus [chief of the Greek gods], and Paul, Hermes [messenger of the Greek gods], since he took the lead in speaking. 
ACT.14.13	The priest of Zeus, whose 
ACT.14.14	But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard about it, they 
ACT.14.15	“Men, why are you doing these things? We too are only men of the same nature as you, bringing the good news to you, so that you turn from these useless 
ACT.14.16	In generations past He permitted all the nations to go their own ways; 
ACT.14.17	yet He did not leave Himself without some witness [as evidence of Himself], in that He kept constantly doing good things 
ACT.14.18	Even saying these words, with difficulty they prevented the people from offering sacrifices to them.
ACT.14.19	But Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium, and having won over the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, thinking he was dead. 
ACT.14.20	But the disciples formed a circle around him, and he got up and went back into the city; and the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe. 
ACT.14.21	They preached the good news to that city and made many disciples, then they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch, 
ACT.14.22	strengthening 
ACT.14.23	When they had appointed elders for them in every church, having prayed with fasting, they entrusted them to the Lord in whom they believed [and joyfully accepted as the Messiah].
ACT.14.24	Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia. 
ACT.14.25	When they had spoken the word [of salvation through faith in Christ] in Perga, they went down to Attalia. 
ACT.14.26	From there they sailed back to 
ACT.14.27	Arriving 
ACT.14.28	And they stayed there a long time with the disciples.
ACT.15.1	Some men came down from Judea and 
ACT.15.2	Paul and Barnabas disagreed greatly and debated with them, so it was determined that Paul and Barnabas and some of the others from their group would go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and the elders [and confer with them] concerning this issue. 
ACT.15.3	So, after being supplied 
ACT.15.4	When they arrived in Jerusalem, they were received warmly by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they reported to them all the things that God had accomplished through them. 
ACT.15.5	But some from the sect of the Pharisees who had believed [in Jesus as the Messiah] stood up and said, “It is necessary to circumcise the Gentile converts and to direct them to observe the Law of Moses.”
ACT.15.6	The apostles and the elders came together to consider this matter. 
ACT.15.7	After a long debate, Peter got up and said to them, “Brothers, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles would hear the message of the gospel and believe. 
ACT.15.8	And God, who knows 
ACT.15.9	and He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith [in Jesus]. 
ACT.15.10	Now then, why are you testing God by placing a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we have been able to endure? 
ACT.15.11	But we believe that we are saved through the [precious, undeserved] grace of the Lord Jesus [which makes us free of the guilt of sin and grants us eternal life], in just the same way as they are.”
ACT.15.12	All the people remained silent, and they listened [attentively] to Barnabas and Paul as they described all the signs and wonders (attesting miracles) that God had done through them among the Gentiles.
ACT.15.13	When they had finished speaking, 
ACT.15.14	Simeon (Simon Peter) has described how God first concerned Himself about taking from among the Gentiles a people for His name [to honor Him and be identified with Him]. 
ACT.15.15	The words of the Prophets agree with this, just as it is written [in Scripture],
ACT.15.16	‘A
ACT.15.16	A
ACT.15.16	I 
ACT.15.16	A
ACT.15.17	S
ACT.15.17	A
ACT.15.18	S
ACT.15.18	W
ACT.15.19	Therefore it is my judgment that we do not trouble 
ACT.15.20	but that we write to them that they are to abstain from 
ACT.15.21	For from ancient generations [the writing of] Moses has been preached in every city, since 
ACT.15.22	Then the apostles and the elders, together with the whole church, decided to select some of their men to go to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas—Judas, who was called Barsabbas, and Silas [also called Silvanus, both], leading men among the brothers. 
ACT.15.23	With them they sent the following letter:
ACT.15.23	“The apostles and the brothers who are the elders, to the brothers and sisters who are from the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia, Greetings.
ACT.15.24	Since we have heard that some of our men have troubled you with 
ACT.15.25	it has been decided by us, having met together, to select men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
ACT.15.26	men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
ACT.15.27	So we have sent Judas and Silas, who will report by word of mouth the same things [that we decided in our meeting].
ACT.15.28	For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to place on you any greater burden than these essentials:
ACT.15.29	that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from [consuming] blood, and from [eating the meat of] things that have been strangled, and from sexual impurity. If you keep yourselves from these things, you will do well. Farewell.”
ACT.15.30	So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch; and after assembling the congregation, they delivered the letter. 
ACT.15.31	And when they had read it, the people rejoiced greatly at the encouragement 
ACT.15.32	Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets (divinely inspired spokesmen), encouraged and strengthened the 
ACT.15.33	After spending some time there, they were sent back by the brothers with [the greeting of] peace to those who had sent them. 
ACT.15.34	However, Silas decided to stay there.
ACT.15.35	But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, and with many others also continued teaching and proclaiming the good news, the word of the Lord [concerning eternal salvation through faith in Christ].
ACT.15.36	After some time Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us go back and visit the brothers and sisters (believers) in every city where we preached the message of the Lord, and see how they are doing.” 
ACT.15.37	Now Barnabas wanted to take [his cousin] John, who was called Mark, along with them. 
ACT.15.38	But Paul kept insisting that they should not take along with them the one who had quit 
ACT.15.39	And it became such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one another, and Barnabas took [John] Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus. 
ACT.15.40	But Paul chose Silas [who was again in Antioch] and set out [on his second journey], commended by the brothers to the grace 
ACT.15.41	And he traveled through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
ACT.16.1	Now Paul traveled to Derbe and also to Lystra. A disciple named Timothy was there, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer [in Christ], however, his father was a Greek. 
ACT.16.2	Timothy was well spoken of by the brothers and sisters who were in Lystra and Iconium. 
ACT.16.3	Paul wanted Timothy to go with him [as a missionary]; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, since they all knew that his father was a Greek. 
ACT.16.4	As they traveled from town to town, they delivered the decrees decided on by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem, for the churches to observe. 
ACT.16.5	So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and they 
ACT.16.6	Now they passed through the territory of Phrygia and Galatia, after being forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in [the west coast province of] Asia [Minor]; 
ACT.16.7	and after they came to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them; 
ACT.16.8	so passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas. 
ACT.16.9	Then a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man from [the Roman province of] 
ACT.16.10	And when he had seen the vision, 
ACT.16.11	So setting sail from Troas, we ran a direct course to Samothrace, and the next day [went on] to Neapolis; 
ACT.16.12	and from there [we came] to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia, a 
ACT.16.13	and on the Sabbath day we went outside the city gate to the bank of the [Gangites] river, where we thought there would be a 
ACT.16.14	A woman named 
ACT.16.15	And when she was baptized, along with her household, she pleaded with us, saying, “If you have judged me 
ACT.16.16	It happened that as we were on our way to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave-girl who had 
ACT.16.17	She followed after Paul and us and kept screaming 
ACT.16.18	She continued doing this for several days. Then Paul, being greatly annoyed 
ACT.16.19	But when her owners saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them before the authorities in the market place [where trials were held], 
ACT.16.20	and when they had brought them before the chief magistrates, they said, “These men, who are Jews, are throwing our city into confusion 
ACT.16.21	They are publicly teaching customs which are unlawful for us, as Romans, to accept or observe.”
ACT.16.22	The crowd also joined in the attack against them, and the chief magistrates tore their robes off them and ordered that Paul and Silas be beaten with rods. 
ACT.16.23	After striking them many times [with the rods], they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to guard them securely. 
ACT.16.24	He, having received such a [strict] command, threw them into the inner prison (dungeon) and fastened their feet in the stocks [in an agonizing position].
ACT.16.25	But about midnight when Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God, and the prisoners were listening to them; 
ACT.16.26	suddenly there was a great earthquake, so [powerful] that the very foundations of the prison were shaken and at once all the doors were opened and everyone’s chains were unfastened. 
ACT.16.27	When the jailer, shaken out of sleep, saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners had escaped. 
ACT.16.28	But Paul shouted, saying, “Do not hurt yourself, we are all here!” 
ACT.16.29	Then the jailer called for torches and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas, 
ACT.16.30	and after he brought them out [of the inner prison], he said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”
ACT.16.31	And they answered, “Believe in the Lord Jesus [as your personal Savior and entrust yourself to Him] and you will be saved, you and your household [if they also believe].” 
ACT.16.32	And they spoke the word of the Lord [concerning eternal salvation through faith in Christ] to him and to all who were in his house. 
ACT.16.33	And he took them that 
ACT.16.34	Then he brought them into his house and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, since he had believed in God with his entire family [accepting with joy what had been made known to them about the Christ].
ACT.16.35	Now when day came, the chief magistrates sent their officers, saying, “Release those men.” 
ACT.16.36	And the jailer repeated the words to Paul, 
ACT.16.37	But Paul said to them, “They have beaten us in public without a trial, men who are Romans, and have thrown us into prison; and now they are sending us out secretly? No! Let them come here themselves and bring us out!” 
ACT.16.38	The officers reported this message to the chief magistrates, and 
ACT.16.39	so they came [to the prison] and appealed to them [with apologies], and when they brought them out, they kept begging them to leave the city. 
ACT.16.40	So they left the prison and went to Lydia’s 
ACT.17.1	Now after Paul and Silas had traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews. 
ACT.17.2	And Paul entered the synagogue, as was his 
ACT.17.3	explaining and pointing out [scriptural evidence] that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and rise from the dead, and 
ACT.17.4	And some of them were persuaded 
ACT.17.5	But the [unbelieving] Jews became jealous, and taking along some thugs from [the lowlifes in] the market place, they formed a mob and set the city in an uproar; and then attacking Jason’s house tried to bring Paul and Silas out to the people. 
ACT.17.6	But when they failed to find them, they dragged Jason and some brothers before the city authorities, shouting, “These men who have turned the world upside down have come here too; 
ACT.17.7	and Jason has welcomed them [into his house and protected them]! And they all are saying things contrary to the decrees of Caesar, [actually] claiming that there is another king, Jesus.” 
ACT.17.8	They stirred up the crowd and the city authorities who heard these things. 
ACT.17.9	And when they had taken security (bail) from Jason and the others, they let them go.
ACT.17.10	The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea; and when they arrived, they entered the Jewish synagogue. 
ACT.17.11	Now these people were more noble 
ACT.17.12	As a result many of them became believers, together with a number of prominent Greek women and men. 
ACT.17.13	But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that the word of God [concerning eternal salvation through faith in Christ] had also been preached by Paul at Berea, they came there too, agitating and disturbing the crowds. 
ACT.17.14	So at that time the brothers immediately sent Paul away to go as far as the sea; but Silas and Timothy remained there [at Berea]. 
ACT.17.15	Those who escorted Paul brought him to Athens; and [after] receiving instructions [from Paul] for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible, they left.
ACT.17.16	Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was greatly angered when he saw that the city was full of idols. 
ACT.17.17	So he had discussions in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing 
ACT.17.18	And some of the 
ACT.17.19	They took him and brought him to the 
ACT.17.20	For you are bringing some startling 
ACT.17.21	(Now all the Athenians and the foreigners visiting there used to spend their [leisure] time in nothing other than telling or hearing something new.)
ACT.17.22	So Paul, standing in the center of the Areopagus, said: “Men of Athens, I observe [with every turn I make throughout the city] that you are very religious 
ACT.17.23	Now as I was going along and carefully looking at your objects of worship, I came to an altar with this inscription: ‘TO AN 
ACT.17.24	The God who created the world and everything in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands; 
ACT.17.25	nor is He 
ACT.17.26	And He made from one 
ACT.17.27	This was so that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grasp for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us. 
ACT.17.28	For in Him we live and move and exist [that is, in Him we actually have our being], as even some of 
ACT.17.29	So then, being God’s children, we should not think that the Divine Nature (deity) is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination 
ACT.17.30	Therefore God overlooked 
ACT.17.31	because He has set a day when He will judge the 
ACT.17.32	Now when they heard [the term] resurrection from the dead, 
ACT.17.33	So Paul left them. 
ACT.17.34	But some men joined him and believed; among them were Dionysius, [a judge] of the 
ACT.18.1	After this Paul left Athens and went to Corinth. 
ACT.18.2	There he met a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife, Priscilla, because [the Roman Emperor] Claudius had issued an edict that all the 
ACT.18.3	and because he was of the same trade, he stayed with them; and they worked 
ACT.18.4	And he reasoned 
ACT.18.5	but when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia (northern Greece), Paul 
ACT.18.6	But since the Jews kept resisting 
ACT.18.7	Then he moved on from there and went to the house of a man named 
ACT.18.8	Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord together with his entire household [joyfully acknowledging Him as Messiah and Savior]; and many of the Corinthians who heard [Paul’s message] were believing and being baptized. 
ACT.18.9	One night the Lord said to Paul in a vision, 
ACT.18.11	So he settled 
ACT.18.12	But when 
ACT.18.13	declaring, “This man is persuading people to worship God in violation of the law [of Moses].” 
ACT.18.14	But when Paul was about to reply, Gallio said to the Jews, “If it were a matter of some misdemeanor or serious crime, O Jews, I would have reason to put up with you; 
ACT.18.15	but since it is merely a question [of doctrine within your religion] about words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves; I am 
ACT.18.16	And he drove them away from the judgment seat. 
ACT.18.17	Then the Greeks all seized 
ACT.18.18	Paul stayed for a while longer, and then told the 
ACT.18.19	Then they arrived in Ephesus, and he left the others there; but he entered the synagogue and reasoned 
ACT.18.20	When they asked him to stay for a longer time, he refused; 
ACT.18.21	but after telling them goodbye and saying, “I will return again if God is willing,” he set sail from Ephesus.
ACT.18.22	When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and 
ACT.18.23	After spending some time 
ACT.18.24	Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent 
ACT.18.25	This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and being spiritually impassioned, he was speaking and teaching accurately the things about Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John; 
ACT.18.26	and he began to speak boldly 
ACT.18.27	And when Apollos wanted to go across to Achaia (southern Greece), the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples, [urging them] to welcome him gladly. When he arrived, he was a great help to those who, through grace, had believed 
ACT.18.28	for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public 
ACT.19.1	It happened that while Apollos was in Corinth, Paul went through the upper [inland] districts and came down to Ephesus, and found some disciples. 
ACT.19.2	He asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed [in Jesus as the Christ]?” And they said, “No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.” 
ACT.19.3	And he asked, “Into what then were you baptized?” They said, “Into John’s baptism.” 
ACT.19.4	Paul said, “John performed a baptism of repentance, 
ACT.19.5	After hearing this, they were baptized [again, this time] in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
ACT.19.6	And when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they 
ACT.19.7	There were about twelve men in all.
ACT.19.8	And he went into the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly, reasoning 
ACT.19.9	But when some were becoming hardened and disobedient [to the word of God], discrediting 
ACT.19.10	This continued for two years, so that all the inhabitants of [the west coast province of] Asia [Minor], Jews as well as Greeks, heard the word of the Lord [concerning eternal salvation through faith in Christ].
ACT.19.11	God was doing extraordinary 
ACT.19.12	so that even handkerchiefs 
ACT.19.13	Then some of the traveling Jewish exorcists also attempted to call the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, “I implore you 
ACT.19.14	Seven sons of one [named] Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this. 
ACT.19.15	But the evil spirit retorted, “I know 
ACT.19.16	Then the man, in whom was the evil spirit, leaped on them and subdued 
ACT.19.17	This became known to all who lived in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks. And fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified 
ACT.19.18	Many of those who had become believers were coming, confessing and disclosing their [former sinful] practices. 
ACT.19.19	And many of those who had practiced magical arts collected their books and [throwing book after book on the pile] began burning them in front of everyone. They calculated their value and found it to be 
ACT.19.20	So the word of the Lord [concerning eternal salvation through faith in Christ] was growing greatly and prevailing.
ACT.19.21	Now after these events, Paul determined in the Spirit that he would travel through 
ACT.19.22	And after sending two of his assistants, Timothy and 
ACT.19.23	About that time there occurred no small disturbance concerning the Way (Jesus, Christianity). 
ACT.19.24	Now a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of [the goddess] Artemis (Diana), was bringing no small profit to the craftsmen. 
ACT.19.25	These [craftsmen] he called together, along with the workmen of similar 
ACT.19.26	You see and hear that not only at Ephesus, but almost all over [the province of] Asia, this Paul has persuaded [people to believe his teaching] and has misled a large number of people, claiming that gods made by [human] hands are not 
ACT.19.27	Not only is there danger that this trade of ours will be discredited, but also that the [magnificent] 
ACT.19.28	When they heard this, they were filled with rage, and they 
ACT.19.29	Then the city was filled with confusion; and people rushed together [as a group] into the amphitheater, dragging along with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were Paul’s traveling companions. 
ACT.19.30	Paul wanted to go into the [pagan] assembly, but the disciples would not let him. 
ACT.19.31	Even some of the Asiarchs (officials) who were his friends sent 
ACT.19.32	Now some shouted one thing and some another, for the gathering was in confusion and most of the people did not know 
ACT.19.33	Some of the crowd advised Alexander [to speak], since the Jews had pushed him forward; and Alexander motioned with his hand [for attention] and intended to make a defense to the people. 
ACT.19.34	But when they realized that he was a Jew, a single outcry went up from the crowd as they shouted for about two hours, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” 
ACT.19.35	After the town 
ACT.19.36	So, since these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet 
ACT.19.37	For you have brought these men here who are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess. 
ACT.19.38	So then, if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are in session and proconsuls are 
ACT.19.39	But if you want anything beyond this, it will be settled in the lawful assembly. 
ACT.19.40	For we are running the risk of being accused of rioting in regard to today’s events, and since there is no reason for it, we will be unable to give an account 
ACT.19.41	And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.
ACT.20.1	After the uproar had ended, Paul sent for the disciples, and when he had encouraged them he told them goodbye, and set off to go to 
ACT.20.2	After he had gone through those districts and had encouraged the believers, he came to Greece. 
ACT.20.3	And he stayed three months, and when a plot was formed against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia (northern Greece). 
ACT.20.4	He was accompanied by Sopater of Berea, 
ACT.20.5	These men went on ahead and were waiting for us (including Luke) at Troas. 
ACT.20.6	We sailed from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread (Passover week), and within five days we reached them at Troas, where we stayed for seven days.
ACT.20.7	Now on the first day of the week (Sunday), when we were gathered together to break bread (share communion), Paul 
ACT.20.8	Now there were many lamps in the upper room where we were assembled, 
ACT.20.9	and there was a young man named Eutychus (“Lucky”) sitting on the window sill. He was sinking into a deep sleep, and as Paul 
ACT.20.10	But Paul went down and threw himself on him and embraced him, and said [to those standing around him], “Do not be troubled, because 
ACT.20.11	When Paul had gone back upstairs and had broken the bread and eaten, he talked [informally and confidentially] with them for a long time—until daybreak [in fact]—and then he left. 
ACT.20.12	They took the boy [Eutychus] home alive, and were greatly comforted 
ACT.20.13	But we went on ahead to the ship and set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul on board there; for that was what he had arranged, intending himself to go [a shorter route] by land. 
ACT.20.14	So when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and sailed on to Mitylene. 
ACT.20.15	Sailing from there, we arrived the next day [at a point] opposite Chios; the following day we crossed over to Samos, and the next day we arrived at Miletus [about 30 miles south of Ephesus]. 
ACT.20.16	Paul had decided to sail on past Ephesus so that he would not end up spending time [unnecessarily] in [the province of] Asia (modern Turkey); for he was in a hurry to be in Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of 
ACT.20.17	However, from Miletus he sent 
ACT.20.18	And when they arrived he said to them:
ACT.20.18	“
ACT.20.19	serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and trials which came on me because of the plots of the Jews [against me]; 
ACT.20.20	[you know] how I did not shrink back in fear from telling you anything that was for your benefit, or from teaching you in public meetings, and from house to house, 
ACT.20.21	solemnly [and wholeheartedly] testifying to both Jews and Greeks, urging them to turn in repentance to God and [to have] faith in our Lord Jesus Christ [for salvation]. 
ACT.20.22	And now, compelled by the Spirit 
ACT.20.23	except that the Holy Spirit solemnly [and emphatically] affirms to me in city after city that imprisonment and suffering await me. 
ACT.20.24	But I do not consider my life as something of value 
ACT.20.25	“And now, listen carefully: I know that none of you, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, 
ACT.20.26	For that reason I testify to you on this [our parting] day that I am innocent of the blood of all people. 
ACT.20.27	For I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole purpose 
ACT.20.28	Take care 
ACT.20.29	I know that after I am gone, [false teachers like] ferocious wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock; 
ACT.20.30	even from among your own selves men will arise, speaking perverse 
ACT.20.31	Therefore be 
ACT.20.32	And now I commend you to God [placing you in His protective, loving care] and [I commend you] to the word of His grace [the counsel and promises of His unmerited favor]. His grace is able to build you up and to give you the [rightful] inheritance among all those who are sanctified [that is, among those who are set apart for God’s purpose—all believers]. 
ACT.20.33	I had no desire for anyone’s silver or gold or [expensive] clothes. 
ACT.20.34	You know personally that these hands ministered to my own needs [working in manual labor] and to [those of] the people who were with me. 
ACT.20.35	In everything I showed you [by example] that by working hard in this way you must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, 
ACT.20.36	When he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all. 
ACT.20.37	And 
ACT.20.38	grieving 
ACT.21.1	When we had torn ourselves away from them and set sail, we ran a straight course and came to Cos, and on the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara; 
ACT.21.2	and after finding a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went on board and set sail. 
ACT.21.3	After we came in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on our left (port side), we sailed on to Syria and put in at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload her cargo. 
ACT.21.4	After looking up the disciples [in Tyre], we stayed there [with them] seven days; and they kept telling Paul through the [Holy] Spirit 
ACT.21.5	When our days there came to an end, we left and proceeded on our journey, while all of the disciples, with their wives and children, escorted us on our way until 
ACT.21.6	Then we boarded the ship, and they returned to their homes.
ACT.21.7	When we had completed the voyage from Tyre, we landed [twenty miles to the south] at Ptolemais, and after greeting the 
ACT.21.8	On the next day we left and came to Caesarea, and we went to the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven [deacons], and stayed with him. 
ACT.21.9	He had four virgin daughters who had the gift of prophecy. 
ACT.21.10	As we were staying there for some time, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. 
ACT.21.11	And coming to [see] us, he took Paul’s [wide] 
ACT.21.12	Now when we had heard this, both we and the local residents 
ACT.21.13	Then Paul replied, “What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart [like this]? For I am ready not only to be bound 
ACT.21.14	And since he would not be dissuaded, we stopped pleading 
ACT.21.15	After this we got ready and started on our way up to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.16	Some of the disciples from Caesarea also came with us, taking us to [the house of] Mnason, a man from Cyprus, a disciple of long standing with whom we were to lodge.
ACT.21.17	When we arrived in Jerusalem, the 
ACT.21.18	On the next day Paul went with us to [see] 
ACT.21.19	After greeting them, Paul 
ACT.21.20	And when they heard it, they 
ACT.21.21	Now they have been told about you, that you are teaching all the Jews who are 
ACT.21.22	What then should be done? They will certainly hear that you have arrived. 
ACT.21.23	Therefore do just what we tell you. We have four men who have taken a vow; 
ACT.21.24	take these men and purify yourself along with them, and pay their expenses [for the temple offerings] so that they may shave their heads. Then everyone will know that there is nothing to the things they have been told about you, but that you yourself also follow and keep the Law. 
ACT.21.25	But with regard to the Gentiles who have believed [in Christ], we have sent them a letter with our decision that they should abstain from meat sacrificed to idols and from [consuming] blood and from [the meat of] what has been strangled and from sexual immorality.” 
ACT.21.26	Then Paul took the [four] men, and the next day he purified himself along with them [by submitting to the ritual]. He went into the temple to give notice of [the time] when the days of purification [ending each vow] would be fulfilled and the usual offering could be presented on behalf of each one.
ACT.21.27	When the seven days [required to complete the ritual] were almost over, [some] Jews from [the province of] Asia [Minor], caught sight of him in the temple, and 
ACT.21.28	shouting, “Men of Israel, help us! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against our people and the Law and this place. And besides, he has brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.” 
ACT.21.29	For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul, and they assumed that he had brought the man into the temple [beyond the court of the Gentiles]. 
ACT.21.30	Then the whole city was provoked 
ACT.21.31	Now while they were trying to kill him, word came to the commander of the [Roman] garrison that all Jerusalem was in a state of upheaval. 
ACT.21.32	So he immediately took soldiers and centurions and ran down among them. When the people saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. 
ACT.21.33	Then the commander came up and arrested Paul, and ordered that he be bound with two chains. Then he asked who he was and what he had done. 
ACT.21.34	But some in the crowd were shouting one thing and others something else; and since he could not determine the facts because of the uproar, he ordered that Paul be taken to the barracks [in the tower of Antonia]. 
ACT.21.35	When Paul got to the steps, he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob; 
ACT.21.36	for the majority of the people kept following them, shouting, “Away with him! [Kill him!]”
ACT.21.37	Just as Paul was about to be taken into the barracks, he asked the commander, “May I say something to you?” And the man replied, “Do you know Greek? 
ACT.21.38	Then you are not [as I assumed] the Egyptian who 
ACT.21.39	Paul said, “I am a Jew from 
ACT.21.40	When the commander had given him permission, Paul, standing on the steps, gestured with his hand to the people; and when there was a great hush, he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect (Jewish Aramaic), saying,
ACT.22.1	“Brethren and fathers (kinsmen), hear my defense which I now offer to you.”
ACT.22.2	When they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew dialect, they became even more quiet. And he continued,
ACT.22.3	“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated at the feet of 
ACT.22.4	I persecuted 
ACT.22.5	as the high priest and all the Council of the elders (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court) can testify; because from them I received letters to the brothers, and I was on my way to Damascus in order to bring those [believers] who were there to Jerusalem in chains to be punished.
ACT.22.6	“But as I was on my way, approaching Damascus about noontime, a great blaze of light suddenly flashed from heaven 
ACT.22.7	And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 
ACT.22.8	And I replied, ‘Who are You, Lord?’ And He said to me, 
ACT.22.9	Now those who were with me 
ACT.22.10	And I asked, ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ And the Lord answered me, 
ACT.22.11	But since I could not see because of the [glorious intensity and dazzling] brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus.
ACT.22.12	“And one Ananias, a devout man according to 
ACT.22.13	came to [see] me, and standing near, he said to me, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight!’ And at that very moment I [recovered my sight and] looked up at him. 
ACT.22.14	And he said, ‘The God of our fathers has appointed you to know His will, [and to progressively understand His plan with clarity and power] and to see the Righteous One [Jesus Christ, the Messiah] and to hear a message from His [own] mouth. 
ACT.22.15	For you will be His witness to all men 
ACT.22.16	Now, why do you delay? Get up and be baptized, and wash away your sins by calling on His name [for salvation].’
ACT.22.17	“Then it happened when I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple [enclosure], that I fell into a trance (vision); 
ACT.22.18	and I saw Him saying to me, 
ACT.22.19	And I said, ‘Lord, they themselves know [without any doubt] that in one synagogue after another I used to imprison and beat those who believed in You [and Your message of salvation]. 
ACT.22.20	And when the blood of Your witness Stephen was being shed, I also was standing nearby approving 
ACT.22.21	And the Lord said to me, 
ACT.22.22	They listened to Paul until [he made] this [last] statement, but now they raised their voices and shouted, “Away with such a man from the earth! He is not fit to live!” 
ACT.22.23	And as they were shouting and throwing off their coats [getting ready to stone Paul] and tossing dust into the air [expressing their anger], 
ACT.22.24	the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, stating that he was to be 
ACT.22.25	But when they had stretched him out 
ACT.22.26	When the centurion heard 
ACT.22.27	So the commander came and asked Paul, “Tell me, are you a Roman?” And he said, “Yes.” 
ACT.22.28	The commander replied, “I 
ACT.22.29	So those who were about to interrogate him 
ACT.22.30	But on the next day, wanting to know the real reason why Paul was being accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and the whole Council (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court) to assemble; and brought Paul down and presented him before them.
ACT.23.1	Then Paul, looking intently at the Council (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court), said, “Kinsmen, I have lived my life before God with a perfectly good conscience until this very day.” 
ACT.23.2	[At this] the high priest 
ACT.23.3	Then Paul said to him, “God is going to strike you, you 
ACT.23.4	But those who stood near Paul said, “Are you insulting the high priest of God?” 
ACT.23.5	Paul said, “I was not aware, brothers, that he was 
ACT.23.6	But recognizing that one group were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, Paul 
ACT.23.7	When he said this, an angry dispute erupted between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the [whole crowded] assembly was divided [into two factions]. 
ACT.23.8	For the Sadducees say that there is no [such thing as a] resurrection, nor an angel, nor a spirit, but the Pharisees [speak out freely and] acknowledge [their belief in] them all. 
ACT.23.9	Then a great uproar occurred, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees’ party stood up and 
ACT.23.10	And as the dissension became even greater, the commander, fearing that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, ordered the troops to go down and forcibly take him from them, and bring him to the barracks.
ACT.23.11	On the following night the Lord stood near Paul and said, 
ACT.23.12	Now when day came, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves under an oath (curse), saying that they would not eat or drink until they had killed Paul. 
ACT.23.13	There were more than forty [men] who formed this plot [and swore this oath]. 
ACT.23.14	They went to the chief priests and elders and said, “We have bound ourselves under a solemn oath not to taste anything [neither food nor drink] until we have killed Paul. 
ACT.23.15	So now you, along with the Council (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court), notify the commander to bring Paul down to you, as if you were going to investigate his case more thoroughly. But we are ready to kill him before he comes near [the place].”
ACT.23.16	But the son of Paul’s sister heard of their [planned] ambush, and he went to the barracks and told Paul. 
ACT.23.17	Then Paul, calling in one of the centurions, said, “Take this young man to the commander, for he has something to tell him.” 
ACT.23.18	So he took him and led him to the commander and said, “Paul the prisoner called for me and asked me to bring this young man to you, because he has something to tell you.” 
ACT.23.19	The commander took him by the hand and stepping aside, 
ACT.23.20	And he said, “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the Council (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court) tomorrow, as if they were going to interrogate him more thoroughly. 
ACT.23.21	But do not listen to them, for more than forty of them are lying in wait for him, and they have bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. Even now they are ready, just waiting for your promise.” 
ACT.23.22	So the commander let the young man leave, instructing him, “Do not tell anyone that you have given me this information.”
ACT.23.23	Then summoning two of the centurions, he said, “Have two hundred soldiers ready by the third hour of the night (9:00 p.m.) to go as far as 
ACT.23.24	also provide mounts for Paul to ride, and bring him safely to 
ACT.23.25	And [after instructing the centurions] he wrote a letter to this effect:
ACT.23.26	“Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix, greetings.
ACT.23.27	This man was seized [as a prisoner] by the Jews and was about to be killed by them, when I came upon him with the troops and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman citizen.
ACT.23.28	And wanting to know the 
ACT.23.29	and I discovered that he was accused in regard to questions 
ACT.23.30	When I was told that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you immediately, also directing his accusers to bring their charges against him before you.”
ACT.23.31	So the soldiers, in compliance with their orders, took Paul and brought him to Antipatris during the night. 
ACT.23.32	And the next day, leaving the horsemen to go on with him, they returned to the barracks. 
ACT.23.33	When these [horsemen] reached Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor, and also presented Paul to him. 
ACT.23.34	After reading the letter, he asked which province Paul was from, and when he learned that he was from Cilicia [an imperial province], 
ACT.23.35	he said, “I will hear your case when your accusers have arrived,” giving orders that Paul be kept under guard in Herod’s Praetorium (the governor’s official residence).
ACT.24.1	Five days later, the high priest Ananias came down [from Jerusalem to Caesarea] with some elders and an attorney 
ACT.24.2	After Paul had been summoned, Tertullus began the complaint [against him], saying 
ACT.24.2	“
ACT.24.3	in every way and in every place, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with all gratitude. 
ACT.24.4	But so that I do not weary you further, I beg you to grant us, by your kindness, a brief hearing. 
ACT.24.5	For we have found this man to be a public menace and one who 
ACT.24.6	He even tried to desecrate the temple, but we took him into custody 
ACT.24.7	but Lysias the commander came, and with great force took him out of our hands, 
ACT.24.8	and ordered his accusers to come before you.
ACT.24.9	The Jews also joined in the attack, declaring 
ACT.24.10	When the governor nodded for him to speak, Paul answered,
ACT.24.10	“
ACT.24.11	As you can easily verify, it has been no more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship. 
ACT.24.12	Neither in the temple, nor in the synagogues, nor 
ACT.24.13	Nor can they present evidence to you to prove what they now bring against me. 
ACT.24.14	But I confess this to you, that according to 
ACT.24.15	having [the same] hope in God which these men cherish themselves, that there shall certainly be a resurrection of [the dead], both of the righteous and of the wicked. 
ACT.24.16	In view of this, I also do my best 
ACT.24.17	Now after several years I came [to Jerusalem] to bring to my people charitable contributions and offerings. 
ACT.24.18	They found me in the temple presenting these 
ACT.24.19	who ought to have been here before you to present their charges, if they have anything against me. 
ACT.24.20	Or else let these men tell what crime they found [me guilty of] when I stood before the Council (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court), 
ACT.24.21	other than for this one statement which I had shouted out as I stood among them, ‘For the resurrection of the dead I am on trial before you today.’ ”
ACT.24.22	But Felix, having a rather accurate understanding about the Way, put them off, saying, “When Lysias the commander comes down, I will decide your case.” 
ACT.24.23	Then he ordered the centurion to keep Paul in custody, but to let him have some freedom, and [he told the centurion] not to stop any of his friends from providing for his needs.
ACT.24.24	Several days later Felix came with his wife 
ACT.24.25	But as he was discussing righteousness, self-control [honorable behavior, personal integrity], and the judgment to come, Felix became frightened and said, “Go away for now, and when I find [a convenient] time I will send for you.” 
ACT.24.26	At the same time he was also hoping to get money from Paul [as a bribe]; so he continued to send for him quite often and talked with him. 
ACT.24.27	But after two years had passed, Felix was succeeded [in office] by 
ACT.25.1	Now Festus arrived in the province, and three days later he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea [Maritima]. 
ACT.25.2	And [there in Jerusalem] the chief priests and the leading men of the Jews brought charges against Paul [before Festus], and they repeatedly pleaded with him, 
ACT.25.3	asking as a concession against Paul, that he would have him brought to Jerusalem; (
ACT.25.4	Festus answered that Paul was being held in custody in Caesarea [Maritima] and that he himself was about to leave shortly. 
ACT.25.5	“So,” he said, “let those who are in a position of authority among you go there with me, and if there is anything criminal about the man, let them bring charges against him.”
ACT.25.6	Now after Festus had spent no more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea, and on the next day he took his seat on the tribunal (the judicial bench), and ordered Paul to be brought [before him]. 
ACT.25.7	After Paul arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many serious charges against him which they were not able to prove, 
ACT.25.8	while Paul declared in his own defense, “I have done no wrong 
ACT.25.9	But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, answered Paul, “
ACT.25.10	Paul said, “I am standing before Caesar’s tribunal, where I ought to be tried. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews, as you also very well know. 
ACT.25.11	Therefore, if I am guilty and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not try to escape death; but if there is nothing to the accusations which these men are bringing against me, no one can hand me over to them. I 
ACT.25.12	Then Festus, after conferring with [the men who formed] his council, answered, “You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you shall go.”
ACT.25.13	Now several days later, 
ACT.25.14	While they were spending many days there, Festus laid Paul’s case before the king, saying, “There is a man here who was left as a prisoner by Felix. 
ACT.25.15	When I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews [told me about him and] brought charges against him, petitioning for a sentence of condemnation against him. 
ACT.25.16	I told them that it was not the custom of the Romans to hand over any man [for punishment] before the accused meets his accusers face to face and has the opportunity to defend himself against the charges. 
ACT.25.17	So after they arrived together here, I did not delay, but on the next day took my place on the tribunal and ordered that the man be brought before me. 
ACT.25.18	When his accusers stood up, they brought no charges against him of crimes that I was expecting [neither civil nor criminal actions], 
ACT.25.19	instead they had some points of disagreement with him about their own 
ACT.25.20	And I, being at a loss as to how to investigate these things, asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried there regarding these matters. 
ACT.25.21	But when Paul appealed to be held in custody for a decision by the Emperor [Nero], I ordered him to be kept in custody until I 
ACT.25.22	Then Agrippa said to Festus, “I would like to hear the man myself.” “Tomorrow,” Festus replied, “you will hear him.”
ACT.25.23	So the next day Agrippa and [his sister] Bernice came with great pageantry, and they went into the auditorium accompanied by the military commanders and the prominent men of the city. At the command of Festus, Paul was brought in. 
ACT.25.24	Then Festus said, “King Agrippa and all you gentlemen present with us, you see this man [Paul] about whom all the Jewish people appealed to me, both at Jerusalem and here, loudly insisting that he ought not to live any longer. 
ACT.25.25	But I found that he had done nothing worthy of death; however, since he appealed to the Emperor [Nero], I decided to send him [to Rome]. 
ACT.25.26	But I have nothing specific about him to write to my lord. So I have brought him before 
ACT.25.27	For it seems absurd 
ACT.26.1	Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You are [now] permitted to speak on your own behalf.” At that, Paul stretched out his hand [as an orator] and made his defense [as follows]:
ACT.26.2	“I consider myself fortunate, King Agrippa, since it is before you that I am to make my defense today regarding all the charges brought against me by the Jews, 
ACT.26.3	especially because you are an expert [fully knowledgeable, experienced and unusually conversant] in all the Jewish customs and controversial issues; therefore, I beg you to listen to me patiently.
ACT.26.4	“So then, all the Jews know my manner of life from my youth up, which from the beginning was spent among my own nation [the Jewish people], and in Jerusalem. 
ACT.26.5	They have known me for a long time, if they are willing to testify to it, that according to the 
ACT.26.6	And now I am standing trial for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers. 
ACT.26.7	Which hope [of the Messiah and the resurrection] our twelve tribes [confidently] expect to realize as they serve 
ACT.26.8	Why is it thought incredible by [any of] you that God raises the dead?
ACT.26.9	“So then, I [once] thought to myself that it was my duty to do many things in opposition to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. 
ACT.26.10	And this is just what I did in Jerusalem; I not only locked up many of the saints (God’s people) in prison after receiving authority from the chief priests, but also when they were being condemned to death, I 
ACT.26.11	And I often punished them [making them suffer] in all the synagogues and tried to force them to blaspheme; and in my extreme rage at them, I kept hunting them even to foreign cities [harassing and persecuting them].
ACT.26.12	“While so engaged, as I was traveling to Damascus with the authority and commission 
ACT.26.13	at midday, O King, I saw on the way a light from heaven surpassing the brightness of the sun, shining all around me and those who were traveling with me. 
ACT.26.14	And when we all had fallen to the ground, I heard a voice in the Hebrew dialect (Jewish Aramaic) saying to me, 
ACT.26.15	And I said, ‘Who are You, Lord?’ And the Lord said, 
ACT.26.16	 [to serve] 
ACT.26.17	[choosing you for Myself and] 
ACT.26.18	 [spiritual] 
ACT.26.19	“So, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, 
ACT.26.20	but I openly proclaimed first to those at Damascus, then at Jerusalem and throughout the region of Judea, and 
ACT.26.21	Because of this 
ACT.26.22	But I have had help from God to this day, and I stand [before people] testifying to small and great alike, stating nothing except what the Prophets and Moses said would come to pass— 
ACT.26.23	that the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed) was to suffer, and that He by being the first to rise from the dead [with an incorruptible body] would proclaim light (salvation) both to the 
ACT.26.24	While Paul was making this defense, Festus said loudly, “Paul, you are out of your mind! Your great education is turning you toward madness.” 
ACT.26.25	But Paul replied, “I am not out of my mind, most excellent 
ACT.26.26	For [your majesty] the king understands these things, and [therefore] I am also speaking to him with confidence 
ACT.26.27	King Agrippa, do you believe the [writings of the] Prophets [their messages and words]? I know that you do.” 
ACT.26.28	Then Agrippa said to Paul, “In a short time [and with so little effort] you [almost] persuade me to become a Christian.” 
ACT.26.29	And Paul replied, “Whether in a short time or long, I wish to God that not only you, but also all who hear me today, might become such as I am, except for these chains.”
ACT.26.30	Then the king stood up, and [with him] the governor and Bernice, and those who were sitting with them; 
ACT.26.31	and after they had gone out, they 
ACT.26.32	And Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to 
ACT.27.1	Now when it was determined that 
ACT.27.2	And going aboard a ship from Adramyttian which was about to sail for the ports along the [west] coast [province] of Asia [Minor], we put out to sea; and Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, accompanied us. 
ACT.27.3	The next day we landed at Sidon; and Julius, treating Paul with [thoughtful] consideration, allowed him to go to his friends 
ACT.27.4	From there we put out to sea and sailed to the leeward (sheltered) side of Cyprus [for protection from weather] because the winds were against us. 
ACT.27.5	When we had sailed across the sea along the coasts of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia [on the south coast of Asia Minor]. 
ACT.27.6	There the centurion [Julius] found an Alexandrian ship [a grain ship of the Roman fleet] sailing for Italy, and he put us aboard it. 
ACT.27.7	For a number of days we sailed slowly and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus; then, because the wind did not allow us to go farther, we sailed under the leeward (sheltered) side of Crete, off Salmone; 
ACT.27.8	and hugging the shore with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea [on the south side of Crete].
ACT.27.9	Now much time had been lost, and 
ACT.27.10	saying, “Men, I sense [after careful thought and observation] that this voyage will certainly be a disaster and with great loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.” 
ACT.27.11	However, the centurion [Julius, ranking officer on board] was persuaded by the pilot and the owner of the ship rather than by what Paul said. 
ACT.27.12	Because the harbor was not well situated for wintering, the majority [of the sailors] decided to put to sea from there, hoping somehow to reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete facing southwest and northwest, and spend the winter 
ACT.27.13	So when the south wind blew softly, thinking that they had obtained their goal, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, hugging the coast.
ACT.27.14	But soon afterward a violent wind, called Euraquilo [a northeaster, a tempestuous windstorm like a typhoon], came rushing down from the island; 
ACT.27.15	and when the ship was caught in it and could not head against the wind [to gain stability], we gave up and [letting her drift] were driven along. 
ACT.27.16	We ran under the shelter of a small island [twenty-five miles south of Crete] called Clauda, and with great difficulty we were able to get the 
ACT.27.17	After hoisting the skiff [on board], they used 
ACT.27.18	On the next day, as we were being violently tossed about by the storm [and taking on water], they began to jettison the cargo; 
ACT.27.19	and on the third day they threw the ship’s tackle (spare lines, blocks, miscellaneous equipment) overboard with their own hands [to further reduce the weight]. 
ACT.27.20	Since neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small storm kept raging about us, from then on all hope of our being saved was [growing worse and worse and] gradually abandoned.
ACT.27.21	After 
ACT.27.22	But 
ACT.27.23	For this very night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood before me, 
ACT.27.24	and said, ‘Stop being afraid, Paul. You must stand before Caesar; and behold, God has given you [the lives of] all those who are sailing with you.’ 
ACT.27.25	So keep up your courage, men, for I believe God 
ACT.27.26	but we must run [the ship] aground on some island.”
ACT.27.27	The fourteenth night had come and we were drifting 
ACT.27.28	So they took soundings [using a weighted line] and found [the depth to be] twenty fathoms (120 feet); and a little farther on they sounded again and found [the depth to be] fifteen fathoms (90 feet). 
ACT.27.29	Then fearing that we might run aground somewhere on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern [to slow the ship] and kept wishing for daybreak to come. 
ACT.27.30	But as the sailors were trying to escape [secretly] from the ship and had let down the skiff into the sea, pretending that they were going to lay out anchors from the bow, 
ACT.27.31	Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men remain on the ship, you cannot be saved.” 
ACT.27.32	Then the soldiers cut away the ropes that held the skiff and let it fall 
ACT.27.33	While they waited for the day to dawn, Paul encouraged them all [and told them] to have some food, saying, “This is the fourteenth day that you have been constantly on watch and going without food, having eaten nothing. 
ACT.27.34	So I urge you to eat some food, for this is for your survival; for not a hair from the head of any of you will perish.” 
ACT.27.35	Having said this, he took bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all, and he broke it and began to eat. 
ACT.27.36	Then all of them were encouraged 
ACT.27.37	All told there were two hundred and seventy-six of us aboard the ship. 
ACT.27.38	After they had eaten enough, they 
ACT.27.39	When day came, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach, and they decided to run the ship ashore there if they could. 
ACT.27.40	So they cut the cables 
ACT.27.41	But striking a 
ACT.27.42	The soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would dive overboard 
ACT.27.43	but the centurion, wanting to save Paul, kept them from [carrying out] their plan. He commanded those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to the shore; 
ACT.27.44	and [he commanded] the rest 
ACT.28.1	After we were safe [on land], we found out that the island was called 
ACT.28.2	And the 
ACT.28.3	But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a 
ACT.28.4	When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they 
ACT.28.5	Then Paul [simply] shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no ill effects. 
ACT.28.6	But they stood watching 
ACT.28.7	In the vicinity of that place there were estates belonging to the leading man of the island, named Publius, who welcomed and entertained us hospitably for three days. 
ACT.28.8	And it happened that the father of Publius was sick [in bed] with recurring attacks of fever and dysentery; and Paul went to him, and after he had prayed, he laid his hands on him and healed him. 
ACT.28.9	After this occurred, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases were coming to him and being healed. 
ACT.28.10	They also gave us many honors [gifts and courtesies expressing respect]; and when we were setting sail, they supplied us with all the things we needed.
ACT.28.11	At the end of three months we set sail on a ship which had wintered at the island, an Alexandrian ship with the 
ACT.28.12	We landed at Syracuse [on Sicily] and stayed there three days. 
ACT.28.13	From there we sailed around and arrived at Rhegium [on Italy’s southern tip]; and a day later a south wind came up, and on the second day we arrived at 
ACT.28.14	There we found some believers and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome. 
ACT.28.15	And the brothers and sisters, having heard news about us, came from as far away as the 
ACT.28.16	When we entered Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself [in rented quarters] with the soldier who was guarding him.
ACT.28.17	Three days later he called together the leaders of the Jews; and when they had gathered, he said to them, “Kinsmen, though I have done nothing against our people or against the customs of our fathers, yet I was turned over as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. 
ACT.28.18	After they had interrogated me, they were ready to release me because I was not guilty of any offense deserving death. 
ACT.28.19	But when the Jews objected [to my release], I was forced to appeal to Caesar (Emperor Nero), not because I had any charge to make against my nation. 
ACT.28.20	For this reason I have asked to see you and talk with you, since it is for the sake of the hope of Israel (the Messiah, the resurrection) that I am bound with this chain.” 
ACT.28.21	They said to him, “We have not received [any] letters about you from Judea, nor have any of the [Jewish] brothers come here and reported or said anything bad about you. 
ACT.28.22	But we would like to hear from you what your views are [that is, exactly what you believe]; for in regard to this sect (Christianity), we are fully aware that it is denounced everywhere.”
ACT.28.23	When they had set a day for Paul, they came to his lodging in large numbers. And he carefully explained [Christianity] to them from morning until evening, solemnly testifying about the kingdom of God and trying to persuade them concerning Jesus, both from the Law of Moses and from the [writings of the] Prophets. 
ACT.28.24	Some were persuaded by what he said, but others would not believe.

ACT.28.30	And Paul lived there for two full years [at his own expense] in his own rented lodging and welcomed all who came to him, 
ACT.28.31	preaching 
ROM.1.1	Paul, a 
ROM.1.2	which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the sacred Scriptures— 
ROM.1.3	[the good news] regarding His Son, who, as to the flesh [His human nature], was born a descendant of David [to fulfill the covenant promises], 
ROM.1.4	and [as to His divine nature] according to the Spirit of holiness was openly designated to be the Son of God with power [in a triumphant and miraculous way] by 
ROM.1.5	It is through Him that we have received grace and [our] apostleship to promote obedience to the faith 
ROM.1.6	and you also are among those who are called of Jesus Christ to belong to Him;
ROM.1.7	[I am writing] to all who are beloved of God in Rome, called to be saints (God’s people) 
ROM.1.8	First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith [your trust and confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness] is being proclaimed in all the world. 
ROM.1.9	For God, whom I serve with my spirit by 
ROM.1.10	in my prayers; always pleading that somehow, by God’s will, I may now at last come to you. 
ROM.1.11	For I long to see you so that I may share with you some spiritual gift, to strengthen 
ROM.1.12	that is, that we may be mutually encouraged 
ROM.1.13	I do not want you to be unaware, 
ROM.1.14	I have a duty to perform 
ROM.1.15	So, for my part, I am ready 
ROM.1.16	I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation [from His wrath and punishment] to everyone who believes [in Christ as Savior], to the Jew first and also to the Greek. 
ROM.1.17	For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed, 
ROM.1.18	For [God does not overlook sin and] the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who in their wickedness suppress 
ROM.1.19	because that which is known about God is evident within them [in their inner consciousness], for God made it evident to them. 
ROM.1.20	For ever since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through His workmanship [all His creation, the wonderful things that He has made], so that they [who fail to believe and trust in Him] are without excuse 
ROM.1.21	For even though 
ROM.1.22	Claiming to be wise, they became fools, 
ROM.1.23	and exchanged the glory 
ROM.1.24	Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their own hearts to [sexual] impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them [abandoning them to the degrading power of sin], 
ROM.1.25	because [by choice] they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.
ROM.1.26	For this reason God gave them over to degrading 
ROM.1.27	and in the same way also the men turned away from the natural function of the woman and were consumed with their desire toward one another, men with men committing shameful acts and in return receiving in their own bodies the inevitable 
ROM.1.28	And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God 
ROM.1.29	until they were filled (permeated, saturated) with every kind of unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice 
ROM.1.30	slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors [of new forms] of evil, disobedient 
ROM.1.31	without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful [without pity]. 
ROM.1.32	Although they know God’s righteous decree 
ROM.2.1	Therefore you have no excuse 
ROM.2.2	And we know that the judgment of God falls justly 
ROM.2.3	But do you think this, O man, when you judge 
ROM.2.4	Or do you have no regard for the wealth of His kindness and tolerance and patience [in withholding His wrath]? Are you [actually] unaware 
ROM.2.5	But because of your callous stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are [deliberately] storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God’s righteous judgment will be revealed. 
ROM.2.6	He 
ROM.2.7	to those who by persistence in doing good seek [unseen but certain heavenly] glory, honor, and immortality, [He will give the gift of] eternal life. 
ROM.2.8	But for those who are selfishly ambitious 
ROM.2.9	 tribulation and anguish [torturing confinement] for every human soul who does [or permits] evil, to the Jew first and also to the Greek, 
ROM.2.10	but glory and honor and 
ROM.2.11	For God shows no partiality [no arbitrary favoritism; with Him one person is not more important than another].
ROM.2.12	For all who have sinned without the Law will also perish without [regard to] the Law, and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged 
ROM.2.13	For it is not those who merely hear the Law [as it is read aloud] who are just 
ROM.2.14	When Gentiles, who do not have the Law [since it was given only to Jews], do 
ROM.2.15	They show that the 
ROM.2.16	on that day when, 
ROM.2.17	But if you bear the name “Jew” and rely on the Law [for your salvation] and boast in [your special relationship to] God, 
ROM.2.18	and [if you claim to] know His will and 
ROM.2.19	and [if you] are confident that you are a [qualified] guide to the blind [those untaught in theology], a light to those who are in darkness, 
ROM.2.20	and [that you are] 
ROM.2.21	well then, you who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal [in ways that are discrete, but just as sinful]? 
ROM.2.22	You who say that one must not commit adultery, 
ROM.2.23	You who boast in the Law, do you [repeatedly] dishonor God by 
ROM.2.24	For, “
ROM.2.25	Circumcision [the sign of the covenant of Abraham] is indeed of value if you practice the Law; but if you 
ROM.2.26	So if the uncircumcised man keeps the requirements of the Law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded [by God] as circumcision? 
ROM.2.27	Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps [the spirit of] the Law will judge you who, 
ROM.2.28	For he is not a [real] Jew who is only one outwardly, nor is [true] circumcision something external and physical. 
ROM.2.29	But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and [true] circumcision is 
ROM.3.1	Then what is the advantage of the Jew? Or what is the benefit of circumcision? 
ROM.3.2	Great in every respect. To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God [His very 
ROM.3.3	What then? If some did not believe 
ROM.3.4	Certainly not! Let God be found true [as He will be], though every person 
ROM.3.4	“T
ROM.3.4	A
ROM.3.5	But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? God is not wrong to inflict His wrath [on us], is He? (I am speaking in purely human terms.) 
ROM.3.6	Certainly not! For 
ROM.3.7	But [as you might say] if through my lie God’s truth was magnified 
ROM.3.8	And why not say, (as some slanderously report and claim that we teach) “Let us do evil so that good may come of it”? Their condemnation [by God] is just.
ROM.3.9	Well then, are we [Jews] better off than they? Not at all; for we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks (Gentiles) are under the control of sin 
ROM.3.10	As it is written 
ROM.3.10	“T
ROM.3.11	T
ROM.3.11	T

ROM.3.18	“T
ROM.3.19	Now we know that whatever the Law [of Moses] says, it speaks to those who are under the Law, so that [the excuses of] every mouth may be silenced [from protesting] and that all the world may be held accountable to God [and subject to His judgment]. 
ROM.3.20	For no 
ROM.3.21	But now the righteousness of God has been clearly revealed [independently and completely] apart from the Law, though it is [actually] confirmed by the Law and the [words and writings of the] Prophets. 
ROM.3.22	This righteousness of God comes through faith in Jesus Christ for all those [Jew or Gentile] who believe [and trust in Him and acknowledge Him as God’s Son]. There is no distinction, 
ROM.3.23	since all have sinned and 
ROM.3.24	and are being justified [declared free of the guilt of sin, made acceptable to God, and granted eternal life] as a gift by His [precious, undeserved] 
ROM.3.25	whom God displayed publicly [before the eyes of the world] as a [life-giving] 
ROM.3.26	 to demonstrate His righteousness at the present time, so that He would be just and the One who justifies those who have faith in Jesus [and rely confidently on Him as Savior].
ROM.3.27	Then what becomes of [our] boasting? It is excluded [entirely ruled out, banished]. On what principle? On [the principle of good] works? No, but on the principle of faith. 
ROM.3.28	For we maintain that an individual is justified by faith distinctly apart from works of the Law [the observance of which has nothing to do with justification, that is, being declared free of the guilt of sin and made acceptable to God]. 
ROM.3.29	Or is God 
ROM.3.30	since indeed it is one [and the same] God who will justify the circumcised by faith [which began with Abraham] and the uncircumcised through [their newly acquired] faith.
ROM.3.31	Do we then nullify the Law by this faith [making the Law of no effect, overthrowing it]? Certainly not! On the contrary, we confirm 
ROM.4.1	What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather 
ROM.4.2	For if Abraham was justified [that is, acquitted from the guilt of his sins] by works [those things he did that were good], he has something to boast about, but not before God. 
ROM.4.3	For what does the Scripture say? “A
ROM.4.4	Now to a laborer, his wages are not credited as a favor 
ROM.4.5	But to the one who does not work [that is, the one who does not try to earn his salvation by doing good], but believes 
ROM.4.6	And in this same way David speaks of the blessing on the one to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:
ROM.4.7	“B
ROM.4.7	A
ROM.4.8	B
ROM.4.9	Is this blessing only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? For we say, “F
ROM.4.10	How then was it credited [to him]? Was it after he had been circumcised, or before? Not after, but while [he was] uncircumcised. 
ROM.4.11	He received the sign of circumcision, a seal 
ROM.4.12	and [that he would be] the [spiritual] father of those circumcised who are not only circumcised, but who also walk in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had before he was circumcised.
ROM.4.13	For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants that he would be heir of the world was not through [observing the requirements of] the Law, but through the righteousness of faith. 
ROM.4.14	If those who are [followers] of the Law are [the true] heirs [of Abraham], then faith [leading to salvation] is of no effect 
ROM.4.15	For the Law results in [God’s] wrath [against sin], but where there is no law, there is no violation [of it either].
ROM.4.16	Therefore, [inheriting] the promise depends entirely on faith [that is, confident trust in the unseen God], in order that 
ROM.4.17	(as it is written [in Scripture], “I 
ROM.4.18	In hope against hope Abraham believed that he would become a father of many nations, as he had been promised [by God]: “S
ROM.4.19	Without becoming weak in faith he considered his own body, now as good as dead [for producing children] since he was about a hundred years old, and [he considered] the deadness of Sarah’s womb. 
ROM.4.20	But he did not doubt 
ROM.4.21	being fully convinced that God had the power to do what He had promised. 
ROM.4.22	Therefore his faith 
ROM.4.23	Now not for his sake alone was it written that it was credited to him, 
ROM.4.24	but for our sake also—to whom righteousness will be credited, as those who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead— 
ROM.4.25	who was betrayed 
ROM.5.1	Therefore, since we have been justified [that is, acquitted of sin, declared blameless before God] by faith, [let us grasp the fact that] we have peace with God [and the joy of reconciliation with Him] through our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed). 
ROM.5.2	Through Him we also have access by faith into this [remarkable state of] grace in which we [firmly and safely and securely] stand. Let us rejoice in our 
ROM.5.3	And not only 
ROM.5.4	and endurance, proven character (spiritual maturity); and proven character, hope 
ROM.5.5	Such hope [in God’s promises] never disappoints 
ROM.5.6	While we were still helpless [powerless to provide for our salvation], at the right time Christ died [as a substitute] for the ungodly. 
ROM.5.7	Now it is an extraordinary thing for one to willingly give his life even for an upright man, though perhaps for a good man [one who is noble and selfless and worthy] someone might even dare to die. 
ROM.5.8	But God clearly shows 
ROM.5.9	Therefore, since we have now been justified [declared free of the guilt of sin] by His blood, [how much more certain is it that] we will be saved from the 
ROM.5.10	For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, 
ROM.5.11	Not only that, but we also rejoice in God [rejoicing in His love and perfection] through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received 
ROM.5.12	Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, so death spread to all people [no one being able to stop it or escape its power], because they all sinned. 
ROM.5.13	Sin was [committed] in the world before the Law [was given], but sin is not charged [against anyone] when there is no law [against it]. 
ROM.5.14	Yet death ruled [over mankind] from Adam to Moses [the Lawgiver], even over those who had not sinned 
ROM.5.15	But the free gift [of God] is not like the trespass [because the gift of grace overwhelms the fall of man]. For if many died by one man’s trespass [Adam’s sin], much more [abundantly] did God’s grace and the gift [that comes] by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, overflow to [benefit] the many. 
ROM.5.16	Nor is the gift [of grace] like 
ROM.5.17	For if by the trespass of the one (Adam), death reigned through the one (Adam), much more 
ROM.5.18	So then as through one trespass [Adam’s sin] there resulted condemnation for all men, even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to 
ROM.5.19	For just as through one man’s disobedience [his failure to hear, his carelessness] the many were made sinners, so through the obedience of the one Man the many will be made righteous 
ROM.5.20	But the Law came to increase 
ROM.5.21	so that, as sin reigned in death, so also grace would reign through righteousness which brings eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
ROM.6.1	What shall we say [to all this]? Should we continue in sin 
ROM.6.2	Certainly not! How can we, the very ones who died to sin, 
ROM.6.3	Or are you ignorant of the fact that all of us who have been 
ROM.6.4	We have therefore been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory 
ROM.6.5	For if we have become one with Him [permanently united] in the likeness of His death, we will also certainly be [one with Him and share fully] 
ROM.6.6	We know that our old 
ROM.6.7	For the person who has died [with Christ] has been freed from [the power of] sin.
ROM.6.8	Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live [together] with Him, 
ROM.6.9	because we know [the self-evident truth] that Christ, having been raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has power over Him. 
ROM.6.10	For the death that He died, He died to sin [ending its power and paying the sinner’s debt] once and for all; and the life that He lives, He lives to [glorify] God [in unbroken fellowship with Him]. 
ROM.6.11	Even so, consider yourselves to be dead to sin [and your relationship to it broken], but alive to God [in unbroken fellowship with Him] in Christ Jesus.
ROM.6.12	Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts 
ROM.6.13	Do not go on offering members of your body to sin as instruments of wickedness. But offer yourselves to God [in a decisive act] as those alive [raised] from the dead [to a new life], and your members [all of your abilities—sanctified, set apart] as instruments of righteousness [yielded] to God. 
ROM.6.14	For sin will no longer be a master over you, since you are not under Law [as slaves], but under [unmerited] grace [as recipients of God’s favor and mercy].
ROM.6.15	What then [are we to conclude]? Shall we sin because we are not under Law, but under [God’s] grace? Certainly not! 
ROM.6.16	Do you not know that when you 
ROM.6.17	But thank God that though you were slaves of sin, you became obedient with all your heart to the standard of teaching in which you were instructed 
ROM.6.18	And having been set free from sin, you have become the slaves of righteousness [of conformity to God’s will and purpose]. 
ROM.6.19	I am speaking in [familiar] human terms because of your natural limitations [your spiritual immaturity]. For just as you presented your bodily members as slaves to impurity and to [moral] lawlessness, leading to further lawlessness, so now offer your members [your abilities, your talents] as slaves to righteousness, leading to 
ROM.6.20	When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness [you had no desire to conform to God’s will]. 
ROM.6.21	So what benefit did you get at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? [None!] For the outcome of those things is death! 
ROM.6.22	But now since you have been set free from sin and have become [willing] slaves to God, you have your benefit, resulting in sanctification [being made holy and set apart for God’s purpose], and the outcome [of this] is eternal life. 
ROM.6.23	For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God [that is, His remarkable, overwhelming gift of grace to believers] is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
ROM.7.1	Or do you not know, 
ROM.7.2	For the married woman [as an example] is bound 
ROM.7.3	Accordingly, she will be designated as an adulteress if she 
ROM.7.4	Therefore, my 
ROM.7.5	When we were 
ROM.7.6	But now we have been released from the Law 
ROM.7.7	What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? Certainly not! On the contrary, if it had not been for the Law, I would not have recognized sin. For I would not have known [for example] about coveting [what belongs to another, and would have had no sense of guilt] if the Law had not [repeatedly] said, “Y
ROM.7.8	But sin, finding an opportunity through the commandment [to express itself] produced in me every kind of coveting 
ROM.7.9	I was once alive without [knowledge of] the Law; but when the commandment came [and I understood its meaning], sin became alive and I died [since the Law sentenced me to death]. 
ROM.7.10	And the 
ROM.7.11	For sin, seizing its opportunity through the commandment, beguiled 
ROM.7.12	So then, the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.
ROM.7.13	Did that which is good [the Law], then become death to me? Certainly not! But sin, in order that it might be revealed as sin, was producing death in me by [using] this good thing [as a weapon], so that through the commandment sin would become exceedingly sinful.
ROM.7.14	We know that the Law is spiritual, but I am 
ROM.7.15	For I do not understand my own actions [I am baffled and bewildered by them]. I do not practice what I want 
ROM.7.16	Now if I 
ROM.7.17	So now [if that is the case, then] it is no longer I who do it [the disobedient thing which I despise], but the sin [nature] which lives in me. 
ROM.7.18	For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh [my human nature, my worldliness—my sinful capacity]. For the willingness [to do good] is present in me, but the doing of good is not. 
ROM.7.19	For the good that I want to do, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want. 
ROM.7.20	But if I am doing the very thing I do not want to do, I am no longer the one doing it [that is, it is not me that acts], but the sin [nature] which lives in me.
ROM.7.21	So I find 
ROM.7.22	For I joyfully delight in the law of God in my inner self [with my new nature], 
ROM.7.23	but I see a different law 
ROM.7.24	Wretched 
ROM.7.25	Thanks be to God [for my deliverance] through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, on the one hand I myself with my mind serve the law of God, but on the other, with my flesh [my human nature, my worldliness, my sinful capacity—I serve] the law of sin.
ROM.8.1	Therefore there is now no condemnation [no guilty verdict, no punishment] for those who are in Christ Jesus [who believe in Him as personal Lord and Savior]. 
ROM.8.2	For the law of the Spirit of life [which is] in Christ Jesus [the law of our new being] has set you free from the law of sin and of death. 
ROM.8.3	For what the Law could not do [that is, overcome sin and remove its penalty, its power] being weakened by the flesh [man’s nature without the Holy Spirit], God did: He sent His own Son in the likeness of sinful man as an offering for sin. And He condemned sin in the flesh [subdued it and overcame it in the person of His own Son], 
ROM.8.4	so that the [righteous and just] requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us who do not live our lives in the ways of the flesh [guided by worldliness and our sinful nature], but [live our lives] in the ways of the Spirit [guided by His power]. 
ROM.8.5	For those who are 
ROM.8.6	Now the mind of the flesh is death [both now and forever—because it pursues sin]; but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace [the spiritual well-being that comes from walking with God—both now and forever]; 
ROM.8.7	the mind of the flesh [with its sinful pursuits] is actively hostile to God. It does not submit itself to God’s law, since it cannot, 
ROM.8.8	and those who are in the flesh [living a life that caters to sinful appetites and impulses] cannot please God.
ROM.8.9	However, you are not [living] in the flesh [controlled by the sinful nature] but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God lives in you [directing and guiding you]. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him [and is not a child of God]. 
ROM.8.10	If Christ lives in you, though your [natural] body is dead because of sin, your spirit is alive because of righteousness [which He provides]. 
ROM.8.11	And if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit, who lives in you.
ROM.8.12	So then, 
ROM.8.13	for if you are living according to the [impulses of the] flesh, you are going to die. But if [you are living] by the [power of the Holy] Spirit you are 
ROM.8.14	For all who are 
ROM.8.15	For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading again to fear [of God’s judgment], but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons [the Spirit producing sonship] by which we [joyfully] cry, “
ROM.8.16	The Spirit Himself testifies 
ROM.8.17	And if [we are His] children, [then we are His] heirs also: heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ [sharing His spiritual blessing and inheritance], if indeed we share in His suffering so that we may also share in His glory.
ROM.8.18	For I consider [from the standpoint of faith] that the sufferings of the present life are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is about to be revealed to us 
ROM.8.19	For [even the whole] creation [all nature] waits eagerly for the children of God to be revealed. 
ROM.8.20	For the creation was subjected to frustration 
ROM.8.21	that the creation itself will also be freed from its bondage to decay [and gain entrance] into the glorious freedom of the children of God. 
ROM.8.22	For we know that the whole creation has been moaning together as in the pains of childbirth until now. 
ROM.8.23	And not only this, but we too, who have the first fruits of the Spirit [a joyful indication of the blessings to come], even we groan inwardly, as we wait eagerly for [the sign of] our adoption as sons—the redemption 
ROM.8.24	For in this hope we were saved [by faith]. But hope [the object of] which is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he already sees? 
ROM.8.25	But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait eagerly for it with patience 
ROM.8.26	In the same way the Spirit [comes to us and] helps us in our weakness. We do not know what prayer to offer 
ROM.8.27	And He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because the Spirit intercedes [before God] on behalf of 
ROM.8.28	And we know [with great confidence] that God [who is deeply concerned about us] causes all things to work together [as a plan] for good for those who love God, to those who are called according to His plan 
ROM.8.29	For those whom He foreknew [and loved and chose beforehand], He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son [and ultimately share in His complete sanctification], so that He would be the firstborn [the most beloved and honored] among many believers. 
ROM.8.30	And those whom He predestined, He also called; and those whom He called, He also justified [declared free of the guilt of sin]; and those whom He justified, He also glorified [raising them to a heavenly dignity].
ROM.8.31	What then shall we say to all these things? If God is for us, who can be [successful] against us? 
ROM.8.32	He who did not spare [even] His own Son, but gave Him up for us all, how will He not also, along with Him, graciously give us all things? 
ROM.8.33	Who will bring any charge against God’s elect (His chosen ones)? It is God who justifies us [declaring us blameless and putting us in a right relationship with Himself]. 
ROM.8.34	Who is the one who condemns us? Christ Jesus is the One who died [to pay our penalty], and more 
ROM.8.35	Who shall ever separate us from the love of

ROM.8.37	Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors 
ROM.8.38	For I am convinced [and continue to be convinced—beyond any doubt] that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present 
ROM.8.39	nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the [unlimited] love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
ROM.9.1	I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience testifies with me [enlightened and prompted] by the Holy Spirit, 
ROM.9.2	that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. 
ROM.9.3	For [if it were possible] I would wish that I myself were accursed, [separated, banished] from Christ for the sake [of the salvation] of my brothers, my natural kinsmen, 
ROM.9.4	who are Israelites, to whom belongs the adoption as sons, the glory (
ROM.9.5	To them belong the patriarchs, and from them, according to His natural descent, 
ROM.9.6	However, it is not as though God’s word has failed [coming to nothing]. For not all who are descended from Israel (Jacob) are [the true] Israel; 
ROM.9.7	and they are not all the children of Abraham because they are his descendants [by blood], but [the promise was]: “Y
ROM.9.8	That is, it is not the children of the body [Abraham’s natural descendants] who are God’s children, but it is the children of the promise who are counted as [Abraham’s true] descendants. 
ROM.9.9	For this is what the promise said: “A
ROM.9.10	And not only that, but this too: Rebekah conceived 
ROM.9.11	and though 
ROM.9.12	it was said to her, “T
ROM.9.13	As it is written 
ROM.9.14	What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? Certainly not! 
ROM.9.15	For He says to Moses, “I 
ROM.9.16	So then God’s choice is not dependent on human will, nor on human effort [the totality of human striving], but on God who shows mercy [to whomever He chooses—it is His sovereign gift]. 
ROM.9.17	For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “I 
ROM.9.18	So then, He has mercy on whom He wills (chooses), and He hardens [the heart of] whom He wills.
ROM.9.19	You will say to me then, “Why does He still blame me [for sinning]? For who [including myself] has [ever] resisted His will 
ROM.9.20	On the contrary, who are you, O man, who answers [arrogantly] back to God 
ROM.9.21	Does the potter not have the right over the clay, to make from the same lump [of clay] one object for honorable use [something beautiful or distinctive] and another for common use [something ordinary or menial]? 
ROM.9.22	What if God, although willing to show His [terrible] wrath and to make His power known, has tolerated with great patience the objects of His wrath [which are] prepared for destruction? 
ROM.9.23	And what if He has done so to make known the riches of His glory to the objects of His mercy, which He has prepared beforehand for glory, 
ROM.9.24	 us, whom He also called, not only from among the Jews, but also from among the Gentiles? 
ROM.9.25	Just as He says in [the writings of the prophet] Hosea:
ROM.9.25	“I

ROM.9.30	What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness [who did not seek salvation and a right relationship with God, nevertheless] obtained righteousness, that is, the righteousness which is produced by faith; 
ROM.9.31	whereas Israel, [though always] pursuing the law of righteousness, did not succeed in fulfilling the law. 
ROM.9.32	And why not? Because it was not by faith [that they pursued it], but as though it were by works [relying on the merit of their works instead of their faith]. They stumbled over the stumbling Stone [Jesus Christ]. 
ROM.9.33	As it is written 
ROM.9.33	“B
ROM.9.33	A
ROM.10.1	Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and my prayer to God for Israel is for their salvation. 
ROM.10.2	For I testify about them that they have a certain enthusiasm for God, but not in accordance with [correct and vital] knowledge [about Him and His purposes]. 
ROM.10.3	For not knowing about God’s righteousness [which is based on faith], and seeking to establish their own [righteousness based on works], they did not submit to God’s righteousness. 
ROM.10.4	For Christ is the end of the law [it leads to Him and its purpose is fulfilled in Him], for [granting] righteousness to everyone who believes [in Him as Savior].
ROM.10.5	For Moses writes that the man who practices the righteousness which is based on law [with all its intricate demands] shall live by it. 
ROM.10.6	But the righteousness based on faith [which produces a right relationship with Him] says the following: “D
ROM.10.7	or, ‘W
ROM.10.8	But what does it say? “T
ROM.10.9	because if you acknowledge 
ROM.10.10	For with the heart a person believes [in Christ as Savior] resulting in his justification [that is, being made righteous—being freed of the guilt of sin and made acceptable to God]; and with the mouth he acknowledges 
ROM.10.11	For the Scripture says, “W
ROM.10.12	For there is no distinction between Jew and Gentile; for the same 
ROM.10.13	For “
ROM.10.14	But how will people call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how will they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher (messenger)? 
ROM.10.15	And how will they preach unless they are commissioned 
ROM.10.16	But they did not all pay attention to the good news [of salvation]; for Isaiah says, “L
ROM.10.17	So faith 
ROM.10.18	But I say, did they not hear? Indeed they have;
ROM.10.18	“T
ROM.10.18	A
ROM.10.19	But I say, did Israel fail to understand [that the gospel was to go also to the Gentiles]? First Moses says,
ROM.10.19	“I 
ROM.10.19	W
ROM.10.20	Then Isaiah is very bold and says,
ROM.10.20	“I 
ROM.10.20	I 
ROM.10.21	But of Israel he says, “A
ROM.11.1	I say then, has God rejected 
ROM.11.2	God has not rejected His [chosen] people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel? 
ROM.11.3	“Lord, 
ROM.11.4	But what is God’s response to him? “I 
ROM.11.5	So too then, at the present time there has come to be a remnant [a small believing minority] according to 
ROM.11.6	But if it is by grace [God’s unmerited favor], it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace is no longer grace [it would not be a gift but a reward for works].
ROM.11.7	What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking [that is, God’s favor by obedience to the Law], but the elect [those chosen few] obtained it, while the rest of them became hardened 
ROM.11.8	just as it is written [in Scripture],
ROM.11.8	“G
ROM.11.8	E
ROM.11.8	[a spiritual apathy that has continued]

ROM.11.9	A 
ROM.11.10	L
ROM.11.10	A
ROM.11.11	So I say, have they stumbled so as to fall [to spiritual ruin]? Certainly not! But by their transgression [their rejection of the Messiah] salvation 
ROM.11.12	Now if Israel’s transgression means riches for the world [at large] and their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment 
ROM.11.13	But 
ROM.11.14	in the hope of somehow making my fellow countrymen jealous [by stirring them up so that they will seek the truth] and 
ROM.11.15	For if their [present] rejection [of salvation] is for the reconciliation of the world [to God], what will their acceptance [of salvation] be but [nothing less than] life from the dead? 
ROM.11.16	If the first portion [of dough offered as the first fruits] is holy, so is the 
ROM.11.17	But if some of the branches were broken off, and you [Gentiles], being like a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among them to share with them the rich root of the olive tree, 
ROM.11.18	do not boast over the [broken] branches 
ROM.11.19	You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.” 
ROM.11.20	That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand by your faith [as believers understanding the truth of Christ’s deity]. Do not be conceited, but [rather stand in great awe of God and] fear [Him]; 
ROM.11.21	for if God did not spare the natural branches [because of unbelief], He will not spare you either. 
ROM.11.22	Then appreciate the gracious kindness and the severity of God: to those who fell [into spiritual ruin], severity, but to you, God’s 
ROM.11.23	And even they [the unbelieving Jews], if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in; for God has the power to graft them in again. 
ROM.11.24	For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and against nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much easier will it be to graft these who are the natural 
ROM.11.25	I do not want you, believers, to be unaware of this mystery [God’s previously hidden plan]—so that you will not be wise in your own opinion—that a partial hardening has [temporarily] happened to Israel [to last] until the full number of the Gentiles has come in; 
ROM.11.26	and so [at that time] all Israel [that is, all Jews who have a personal faith in Jesus as Messiah] will be saved; just as it is written [in Scripture],

ROM.11.26	H
ROM.11.27	“T
ROM.11.27	W
ROM.11.28	From the standpoint of the gospel, the Jews [at present] are enemies [of God] for your sake [which is for your benefit], but from the standpoint of God’s choice [of the Jews as His people], they are still loved by Him for the sake of the fathers. 
ROM.11.29	For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable [for He does not withdraw what He has given, nor does He change His mind about those to whom He gives His grace or to whom He sends His call]. 
ROM.11.30	Just as you once were disobedient 
ROM.11.31	so they too have now become disobedient so that they too may one day receive mercy because of the mercy shown to you. 
ROM.11.32	For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that He may show mercy to all [Jew and Gentile alike].
ROM.11.33	Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments 
ROM.11.34	For 
ROM.11.35	Or 
ROM.11.36	For from Him [all things originate] and through Him [all things live and exist] and to Him are all things [directed]. To Him be glory 
ROM.12.2	And do not be conformed to this world [any longer with its superficial values and customs], but be 
ROM.12.3	For by the grace [of God] given to me I say to everyone of you not to think more highly of himself [and of his importance and ability] than he ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as God has apportioned to each a degree of faith [and a purpose designed for service]. 
ROM.12.4	For just as in one [physical] body we have many parts, and these parts do not all have the same function 
ROM.12.5	so we, who are many, are [nevertheless just] one body in Christ, and individually [we are] parts one of another [mutually dependent on each other]. 
ROM.12.6	Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, 
ROM.12.7	if service, in the act of serving; or he who teaches, in the act of teaching; 
ROM.12.8	or he who encourages, in the act of encouragement; he who gives, with generosity; he who leads, 
ROM.12.9	Love is to be sincere 
ROM.12.10	Be devoted to one another with [authentic] brotherly affection [as members of one family], give preference to one another in honor; 
ROM.12.11	never lagging behind in diligence; aglow in the Spirit, 
ROM.12.12	 rejoicing in hope [because of our confidence in Christ], steadfast 
ROM.12.13	contributing to the needs of God’s people, pursuing [the practice of] hospitality.
ROM.12.14	Bless those who persecute you [who cause you harm or hardship]; bless and do not curse [them]. 
ROM.12.15	Rejoice with those who rejoice [sharing others’ joy], and weep with those who weep [sharing others’ grief]. 
ROM.12.16	Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty [conceited, self-important, exclusive], but associate with humble people [those with a realistic self-view]. Do not overestimate yourself. 
ROM.12.17	Never repay anyone evil for evil. Take thought for what is right 
ROM.12.18	If possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. 
ROM.12.19	Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave the way open for God’s wrath [and His judicial righteousness]; for it is written [in Scripture], “V
ROM.12.20	“B
ROM.12.21	Do not be overcome 
ROM.13.1	Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God [granted by His permission and sanction], and those which exist have been put in place by God. 
ROM.13.2	Therefore whoever 
ROM.13.3	For [civil] authorities are not a source of fear for [people of] good behavior, but for [those who do] evil. Do you want to be unafraid of authority? Do what is good and you will receive approval 
ROM.13.4	For he is God’s servant to you for good. But if you do wrong, [you should] be afraid; for he does not carry the [executioner’s] sword for nothing. He is God’s servant, an avenger who brings punishment on the wrongdoer. 
ROM.13.5	Therefore one must be subject [to civil authorities], not only to escape the punishment [that comes with wrongdoing], but also as a matter of principle [knowing what is right before God]. 
ROM.13.6	For this same reason you pay taxes, for 
ROM.13.7	Pay to all what is due: tax to whom tax 
ROM.13.9	The commandments, “Y
ROM.13.10	Love does no wrong to a neighbor [it never hurts anyone]. Therefore [unselfish] love is the fulfillment of the Law.
ROM.13.11	Do this, knowing that this is a critical time. It is already the hour for you to awaken from your sleep [of spiritual complacency]; for our salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed [in Christ]. 
ROM.13.12	The night [this present evil age] is almost gone and the day [of Christ’s return] is almost here. So let us fling away the works of darkness and put on the [full] armor of light. 
ROM.13.13	Let us conduct ourselves properly 
ROM.13.14	But clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for [nor even think about gratifying] the flesh in regard to its improper desires.
ROM.14.1	As for the 
ROM.14.2	One man’s faith permits him to eat everything, while the weak 
ROM.14.3	The one who eats [everything] is not to look down on the one who does not eat, and the one who does not eat must not criticize 
ROM.14.4	Who are you to judge the servant of another? Before his own master he stands [approved] or falls [out of favor]. And he [who serves the Master—the Lord] will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.
ROM.14.5	One person regards one day as better [or more important] than another, while another regards every day [the same as any other]. Let everyone be fully convinced (assured, satisfied) in his own mind. 
ROM.14.6	He who observes the day, observes it for the Lord. He who eats, eats for the Lord, since he gives thanks to God; while he who abstains, abstains for the Lord and gives thanks to God. 
ROM.14.7	None of us lives for himself [for his own benefit, but for the Lord], and none of us dies for himself [but for the Lord]. 
ROM.14.8	If we live, we live for the Lord, and if we die, we die for the Lord. So then, whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s. 
ROM.14.9	For Christ died and lived again for this reason, that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living.
ROM.14.10	But you, why do you criticize your brother? Or you again, why do you look down on your [believing] brother 
ROM.14.11	For it is written [in Scripture],
ROM.14.11	“A
ROM.14.11	A
ROM.14.12	So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God.
ROM.14.13	Then let us not criticize one another anymore, but rather determine this—not to put an obstacle or a stumbling block 
ROM.14.14	I know and am convinced [as one] in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean [ritually defiled, and unholy] in itself; but [nonetheless] it is unclean to anyone who thinks it is unclean. 
ROM.14.15	If your brother is being hurt 
ROM.14.16	Therefore do not let what is a good thing for you [because of your freedom to choose] be spoken of as evil [by someone else]; 
ROM.14.17	for the kingdom of God is not 
ROM.14.18	For the one who serves Christ in this way [recognizing that food choice is secondary] is acceptable to God and is approved by men. 
ROM.14.19	So then, let us pursue [with enthusiasm] the things which make for peace and the building up of one another [things which lead to spiritual growth]. 
ROM.14.20	Do not, for the sake of food, tear down the work of God. All things indeed are [ceremonially] clean, but they are wrong for the person who eats and offends [another’s conscience in the process]. 
ROM.14.21	It is good [to do the right thing and] not eat meat or drink wine, or do anything that offends your brother 
ROM.14.22	The faith which you have [that gives you freedom of choice], have as your own conviction before God [just keep it between yourself and God, seeking His will]. Happy is he who has no reason to condemn himself for what he approves. 
ROM.14.23	But he who is uncertain [about eating a particular thing] is condemned if he eats, because he is not 
ROM.15.1	Now we who are strong [in our convictions and faith] ought to [patiently] put up with the weaknesses of those who are not strong, and not just please ourselves. 
ROM.15.2	Let each one of us [make it a practice to] please his 
ROM.15.3	For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is written [in Scripture], “T
ROM.15.4	For whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope 
ROM.15.5	Now may the God who gives endurance and who supplies encouragement grant that you be of the same mind with one another according to Christ Jesus, 
ROM.15.6	so that with one accord you may with one voice glorify 
ROM.15.7	Therefore, [continue to] accept 
ROM.15.8	For I tell you that Christ has become a servant 
ROM.15.9	and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy [to them, since God had no covenant with them]. As it is written

ROM.15.12	I
ROM.15.13	May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing [through the experience of your faith] that by the power of the Holy Spirit you will abound in hope 
ROM.15.14	Personally I am convinced about you, my brothers and sisters, that you yourselves are full of goodness, amply filled with all [spiritual] knowledge, and competent to admonish 
ROM.15.15	Still, on some points I have written to you very boldly 
ROM.15.16	to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. I minister as a priest the gospel of God, in order that my offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable [to Him], sanctified [made holy and set apart for His purpose] by the Holy Spirit. 
ROM.15.17	In Christ Jesus, then, I have found [legitimate] reason for boasting in things related [to my service] to God. 
ROM.15.18	For I will not [even] presume to speak of anything except what Christ has done through me [as an instrument in His hands], resulting in the obedience of the Gentiles [to the gospel], by word and deed, 
ROM.15.19	with the power of signs and wonders, [and all of it] in the power of the Spirit. So [starting] from Jerusalem and as far 
ROM.15.20	Accordingly I set a goal to preach the gospel, not where Christ’s name was already known, so that I would not build on another man’s foundation; 
ROM.15.21	but [instead I would act on this goal] as it is written [in Scripture],
ROM.15.21	“T
ROM.15.21	A
ROM.15.22	This [goal—my commitment to this principle] is the reason why I have often been prevented from coming to you [in Rome]. 
ROM.15.23	But now, with no further place for work in these regions, and since I have longed for many years to come to you— 
ROM.15.24	whenever I go [on my trip] to Spain—I hope to see you as I pass through [Rome], and to be helped on my journey there by you, after I have first enjoyed your company for a little while. 
ROM.15.25	But for now, I am going to Jerusalem to serve the saints (Jewish believers). 
ROM.15.26	For [Gentile believers in] 
ROM.15.27	They were pleased to do it, and they are indebted to them. For if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual things, then they are indebted to serve them also in [tangible] material things. 
ROM.15.28	Therefore, when I have finished this [mission] and have safely given to them what has been raised, I will go on by way of you to Spain. 
ROM.15.29	I know that when I do come to you, I will come in the abundant blessing of Christ.
ROM.15.30	I urge you, believers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join together with me in your prayers to God in my behalf, 
ROM.15.31	[and pray] that I may be rescued from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints (Jewish believers) 
ROM.15.32	so that by God’s will I may come to you with joy and find rest in your company. 
ROM.15.33	May the God of peace be with you all! Amen.
ROM.16.1	Now I introduce 
ROM.16.2	that you may receive her in the Lord [with love and hospitality], as

ROM.16.4	who risked their own necks [endangering their very lives] for my life. To them not only do I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles. 
ROM.16.5	Also 
ROM.16.6	Greet Mary, who has worked so hard for you. 
ROM.16.7	Greet Andronicus and 
ROM.16.8	Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord.

ROM.16.17	I urge you, brothers and sisters, to keep your eyes on those who cause dissensions and create obstacles 
ROM.16.18	For such people do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites and base desires. By smooth and flattering speech they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting [the innocent and the naive]. 
ROM.16.19	For

1CO.1.3	Grace to you and peace [inner calm and spiritual well-being] from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1CO.1.4	I thank my God always for you because of the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus, 
1CO.1.5	so that in everything you were [exceedingly] enriched in Him, in all speech [empowered by the spiritual gifts] and in all knowledge [with insight into the faith]. 
1CO.1.6	In this way our testimony about Christ was confirmed 
1CO.1.7	so that you are not lacking in any

1CO.1.9	God is faithful [He is reliable, trustworthy and ever true to His promise—He can be depended on], and through Him you were called into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
1CO.1.10	But I urge you, believers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you be in full agreement in what you say, and that there be no divisions 
1CO.1.11	For I have been informed about you, my brothers and sisters, by those of Chloe’s 
1CO.1.12	Now I mean this, that each one of you says, “I am [a disciple] of Paul,” or “I am [a disciple] of Apollos,” or “I am [a disciple] of Cephas (Peter),” or “I am [a disciple] of Christ.” 
1CO.1.13	Has Christ been divided [into different parts]? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul? [Certainly not!] 
1CO.1.14	I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius, 
1CO.1.15	so that no one would say that you were baptized into my name. 
1CO.1.16	Now I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I do not know if I baptized anyone else. 
1CO.1.17	For Christ did not send me [as an apostle] to baptize, but [commissioned and empowered me] to preach the good news [of salvation]—not with clever

1CO.1.24	but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks (Gentiles), Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God. 
1CO.1.25	[This is] because the foolishness of God [is not foolishness at all and] is wiser than men [far beyond human comprehension], and the weakness of God is stronger than men [far beyond the limits of human effort].
1CO.1.26	Just look at your own calling, believers; not many [of you were considered] wise according to human standards, not many powerful 
1CO.1.27	But God has selected [for His purpose] the foolish things of the world to shame the wise [revealing their ignorance], and God has selected [for His purpose] the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong [revealing their frailty]. 
1CO.1.28	God has selected [for His purpose] the insignificant (base) things of the world, and the things that are despised 
1CO.1.29	so that no one may [be able to] boast in the presence of God. 
1CO.1.30	But it is from Him that you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God [revealing His plan of salvation], and righteousness [making us acceptable to God], and sanctification [making us holy and setting us apart for God], and redemption [providing our ransom from the penalty for sin], 
1CO.1.31	so then, as it is written [in Scripture], “H
1CO.2.1	And when I came to you, brothers and sisters, proclaiming to you the 
1CO.2.2	for I made the decision to 
1CO.2.3	I came to you in [a state of] weakness and fear and great trembling. 
1CO.2.4	And my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom [using clever rhetoric], but [they were delivered] in demonstration of the [Holy] Spirit [operating through me] and of [His] power [stirring the minds of the listeners and persuading them], 
1CO.2.5	so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom 
1CO.2.6	Yet we do speak wisdom among those 
1CO.2.7	but we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the 
1CO.2.8	None of the rulers of this age recognized 
1CO.2.9	but just as it is written [in Scripture],
1CO.2.9	“T
1CO.2.9	A
1CO.2.9	A
1CO.2.10	For God has unveiled them 
1CO.2.11	For what person knows the thoughts and motives of a man except the man’s spirit within him? So also no one knows the 
1CO.2.12	Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the [Holy] Spirit who is from God, so that we may know 
1CO.2.13	We also speak of these things, not in words taught 
1CO.2.14	But the natural [unbelieving] man does not accept the things [the teachings and revelations] of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness [absurd and illogical] to him; and he is incapable of understanding them, because they are spiritually discerned 
1CO.2.15	But the spiritual man [the spiritually mature Christian] judges all things [questions, examines and applies what the Holy Spirit reveals], yet is himself judged by no one [the unbeliever cannot judge and understand the believer’s spiritual nature]. 
1CO.2.16	For 
1CO.3.1	However, brothers and sisters, I could not talk to you as to spiritual people, but [only] as to 
1CO.3.2	I fed you with milk, not solid food; for you were not yet able 
1CO.3.3	You are still 
1CO.3.4	For when one 
1CO.3.5	What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Just servants through whom you believed [in Christ], even as the Lord appointed to each his task. 
1CO.3.6	I planted, Apollos watered, but God [all the while] was causing the growth. 
1CO.3.7	So neither is the one who plants nor the one who waters anything, but [only] God who causes the growth. 
1CO.3.8	He who plants and he who waters are one [in importance and esteem, working toward the same purpose]; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor. 
1CO.3.9	For we are God’s fellow workers [His servants working together]; you are God’s cultivated field [His garden, His vineyard], God’s building.
1CO.3.10	According to the [remarkable] grace of God which was given to me [to prepare me for my task], like a skillful master builder I laid a foundation, and now another is building on it. But each one must be careful how he builds on it, 
1CO.3.11	for no one can lay a foundation other than the one which is [already] laid, which is Jesus Christ. 
1CO.3.12	But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, 
1CO.3.13	each one’s work will be clearly shown [for what it is]; for the day [of judgment] will disclose it, because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality 
1CO.3.14	If any person’s work which he has built [on this foundation, that is, any outcome of his effort] remains [and survives this test], he will receive a reward. 
1CO.3.15	But if any person’s work is burned up [by the test], he will suffer the loss [of his reward]; yet he himself will be saved, but only as [one who has barely escaped] through fire.
1CO.3.17	If anyone destroys the temple of God [corrupting it with false doctrine], God will destroy the destroyer; for the temple of God is holy (sacred), and that is what you are.
1CO.3.18	Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool [discarding his worldly pretensions and acknowledging his lack of wisdom], so that he may become [truly] wise. 
1CO.3.19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness (absurdity, stupidity) before God; for it is written [in Scripture], “[He is] T
1CO.3.20	and again, “T
1CO.3.21	So let no one boast in men [about their wisdom, or of having this or that one as a leader]. For all things are yours, 
1CO.3.22	whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas (Peter) or the world or life or death or things present or things to come; all things are yours, 
1CO.3.23	and you belong to Christ; and Christ belongs to God.
1CO.4.1	So then, let us [who minister] be regarded as servants of Christ and stewards (trustees, administrators) of the mysteries of God [that He chooses to reveal]. 
1CO.4.2	In this case, moreover, it is required [as essential and demanded] of stewards that one be found faithful 
1CO.4.3	But [as for me personally] it matters very little to me that I may be judged by you or 
1CO.4.4	I am aware of nothing against myself 
1CO.4.5	So do not go on passing judgment before the appointed time, 
1CO.4.6	Now I have applied these things [that is, the analogies about factions] to myself and Apollos for your benefit, believers, so that you may learn from us not to go beyond what is written [in Scripture], so that none of you will become arrogant 
1CO.4.7	For who regards you as superior 
1CO.4.8	[You behave as if] you are already filled [with spiritual wisdom and in need of nothing more]. Already you have become rich [in spiritual gifts]! You [in your conceit] have ascended your thrones 
1CO.4.9	For, I think, God has exhibited us apostles at the end of the line, like men sentenced to death [and paraded as prisoners in a procession], because we have become a spectacle to the world [a show in the world’s amphitheater], both to angels and to men. 
1CO.4.10	We are [regarded as] fools for Christ, but you are so wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are highly esteemed, but we are dishonored. 
1CO.4.11	To this present hour we are both hungry and thirsty; we are 
1CO.4.12	We work [for our living], working 
1CO.4.13	When we are slandered, we 
1CO.4.14	I do not write these things to shame you, but to warn 
1CO.4.15	For even if you were to have ten thousand teachers [to guide you] in Christ, yet you would not have many fathers [who led you to Christ and assumed responsibility for you], for I became your father in Christ Jesus through the good news [of salvation]. 
1CO.4.16	So I urge you, be imitators of me [just as a child imitates his father]. 
1CO.4.17	For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, and he will remind you of my way of life in Christ [my conduct and my precepts for godly living], just as I teach everywhere in every church. 
1CO.4.18	Now some of you have become arrogant 
1CO.4.19	But I will come to you soon, if the Lord is willing, and I will find out not just the talk of these arrogant people, but [evaluate] their [spiritual] power [whether they live up to their own claims]. 
1CO.4.20	For the kingdom of God is not based on talk but on power. 
1CO.4.21	Which do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a rod [of discipline and correction], or with love and a gentle spirit?
1CO.5.1	It is actually reported [everywhere] that there is sexual immorality among you, a kind of immorality that is condemned even among the [unbelieving] Gentiles: that someone 
1CO.5.2	And you are proud 
1CO.5.3	For I, though absent [from you] in body but present in spirit, have already passed judgment on him who has committed this [act], as if I were present. 
1CO.5.4	In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are assembled, and I am with you in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus, 
1CO.5.5	you are to 
1CO.5.6	Your boasting [over the supposed spirituality of your church] is not good [indeed, it is vulgar and inappropriate]. 
1CO.5.7	Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new batch, just as you are, still unleavened. For Christ our Passover Lamb has been sacrificed. 
1CO.5.8	Therefore, let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of vice 
1CO.5.9	I wrote you in my [previous] letter not to associate with [sexually] immoral people— 
1CO.5.10	not meaning the immoral people of this world, or the greedy ones and swindlers, or idolaters, for then you would have to get out of the world 
1CO.5.11	But actually, I have written to you not to associate with any so-called [Christian] brother if he is sexually immoral or greedy, or is an idolater [devoted to anything that takes the place of God], or is a reviler [who insults or slanders or otherwise verbally abuses others], or is a drunkard or a swindler—you must not so much as 
1CO.5.12	For what business is it of mine to judge outsiders (non-believers)? Do you not judge those who are within 
1CO.5.13	God 
1CO.6.1	Does any one of you, when he has a 
1CO.6.2	Do you not know that the saints (God’s people) will [one day] judge the world? If the world is to be judged by you, are you not competent 
1CO.6.3	Do you not know that we [believers] will judge angels? How much more then [as to] matters of this life? 
1CO.6.4	So if you have lawsuits dealing with matters of this life, are you appointing those as judges [to hear disputes] who are of no account in the church? 
1CO.6.5	I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is not one wise man among you who [is governed by integrity and] will be able 
1CO.6.6	but 
1CO.6.7	Why, the very fact that you have lawsuits with one another is already a defeat. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded? 
1CO.6.8	On the contrary, it is you who wrong and defraud, and you do this even to your brothers and sisters.
1CO.6.9	Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit 
1CO.6.10	nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers [whose words are used as weapons to abuse, insult, humiliate, intimidate, or slander], nor swindlers will inherit 
1CO.6.11	And such were some of you [before you believed]. But you were washed [by the atoning sacrifice of Christ], you were sanctified [set apart for God, and made holy], you were justified [declared free of guilt] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the [Holy] Spirit of our God [the source of the believer’s new life and changed behavior].
1CO.6.12	Everything is permissible for me, but not all things are beneficial. Everything is permissible for me, but I will not be enslaved by anything [and brought under its power, allowing it to control me]. 
1CO.6.13	Food is for the stomach and the stomach for food, but God will do away with both of them. The body is not intended for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body [to save, sanctify, and raise it again because of the sacrifice of the cross]. 
1CO.6.14	And God has not only raised the Lord [to life], but will also raise us up by His power. 
1CO.6.15	Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Am I therefore to take the members of Christ and make them part of a 
1CO.6.16	Do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body 
1CO.6.17	But the one who is united 
1CO.6.18	Run away from sexual immorality [in any form, whether thought or behavior, whether visual or written]. Every 
1CO.6.19	Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is within you, whom you have [received as a gift] from God, and that you are not your own [property]? 
1CO.6.20	You were bought with a price [you were actually purchased with the precious blood of Jesus and made His own]. So then, honor 
1CO.7.1	Now as to the matters of which you wrote: It is good (beneficial, advantageous) for a man not to touch a woman [outside marriage]. 
1CO.7.2	But because of [the temptation to participate in] sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. 
1CO.7.3	The husband must fulfill his [marital] duty to his wife [with good will and kindness], and likewise the wife to her husband. 
1CO.7.4	The wife does not have [exclusive] authority over her own body, but the husband 
1CO.7.5	Do not deprive each other [of marital rights], except perhaps by mutual consent for a time, so that you may devote yourselves [unhindered] to prayer, but come together again so that Satan will not tempt you [to sin] because of your lack of self-control. 
1CO.7.6	But I am saying this as a concession, not as a command. 
1CO.7.7	I wish that all the people were as I am; but each person has his own gift from God, one of this kind and one of that.
1CO.7.8	But I say to the unmarried and to the widows, [that as a practical matter] it is good if they remain [single and entirely devoted to the Lord] 
1CO.7.9	But if they do not have [sufficient] self-control, they should marry; for it is better to marry than to burn 
1CO.7.10	But to the 
1CO.7.11	(but even if she does leave him, let her remain single or else be 
1CO.7.12	To the 
1CO.7.13	And if any [believing] woman has an unbelieving husband, and he consents to live with her, she must not leave him. 
1CO.7.14	For the unbelieving husband is 
1CO.7.15	But if the unbelieving partner leaves, let him leave. In such cases the [remaining] brother or sister is not [spiritually or morally] bound. But God has called us to 
1CO.7.16	For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband [by leading him to Christ]? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife [by leading her to Christ]?
1CO.7.17	Only, let each one live the life which the Lord has assigned him, and to which God has called him [for each person is unique and is accountable for his choices and conduct, let him walk in this way]. This is the rule I make in all the churches. 
1CO.7.18	Was anyone at the time of his calling [from God already] circumcised? He is not to 
1CO.7.19	Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but 
1CO.7.20	Each one should remain in the condition in which he was [when he was] called.
1CO.7.21	Were you a slave when you were called? Do not worry about that [since your status as a believer is 
1CO.7.22	For he who was a slave when he was called in the Lord is a freedman of the Lord, likewise he who was free when he was called is a slave of Christ. 
1CO.7.23	You were bought with a price [a precious price paid by Christ]; do not become slaves to men [but to Christ]. 
1CO.7.24	Brothers, let each one remain with God in that 
1CO.7.25	Now concerning the virgins [of marriageable age] I have no command of the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy. 
1CO.7.26	I think then that because of the impending distress [that is, the pressure of the current trouble], it is good for a man to remain as he is. 
1CO.7.27	Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be released. Are you 
1CO.7.28	But if you do marry, you have not sinned [in doing so]; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned [in doing so]. Yet those [who marry] will have troubles (special challenges) in this life, and I am trying to spare you that. 
1CO.7.29	But I say this, believers: the 
1CO.7.30	and those who weep, as though they did not weep; and those who rejoice, as though they did not rejoice; and those who buy, as though they did not possess [anything]; 
1CO.7.31	and those who use the world [taking advantage of its opportunities], as though they did not make full use of it. For the outward form of this world [its present social and material nature] is passing away.
1CO.7.32	But I want you to be free from concern. The unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord; 
1CO.7.33	but the married man is concerned about worldly things, how he may please his wife, 
1CO.7.34	and 
1CO.7.35	Now I say this for your own benefit; not to restrict you, but to promote what is appropriate and secure undistracted devotion to the Lord.
1CO.7.36	But if any man thinks that he is not acting properly 
1CO.7.37	But the man who stands firmly committed in his heart, having no compulsion [to yield to his daughter’s request], and has authority over his own will, and has decided in his own heart to keep his own virgin [daughter from being married], he will do well. 
1CO.7.38	So then both the father who gives his virgin 
1CO.7.39	A wife is bound [to her husband by law] as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry whomever she wishes, only [provided that he too is] in the Lord. 
1CO.7.40	But in my opinion a widow is happier if she stays as she is. And I think that I also have the Spirit of God [in this matter].
1CO.8.1	Now about food sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge [concerning this]. Knowledge [alone] makes [people self-righteously] arrogant, but love [that unselfishly seeks the best for others] builds up 
1CO.8.2	If anyone imagines that he knows 
1CO.8.3	But if anyone loves God [with awe-filled reverence, obedience and gratitude], he is known by Him [as His very own and is greatly loved].
1CO.8.4	In this matter, then, of eating food offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world [it has no real existence], and that there is no God but one. 
1CO.8.5	For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, as indeed there are many gods and many lords, 
1CO.8.6	yet for us there is but one God, the Father, 
1CO.8.7	However, not all [believers] have this knowledge. But some, being accustomed [throughout their lives] to [thinking of] the idol until now [as real and living], still eat food 
1CO.8.8	Now food will not commend us to God 
1CO.8.9	Only be careful that this liberty of yours [this power to choose] does not somehow become a stumbling block [that is, a temptation to sin] to the weak [in conscience]. 
1CO.8.10	For if someone sees you, a person having 
1CO.8.11	For through your knowledge (spiritual maturity) this weak man is ruined [that is, he suffers in his spiritual life], the brother for whom Christ died. 
1CO.8.12	And when you sin against the brothers and sisters in this way and wound their weak conscience [by confusing them], you sin against Christ. 
1CO.8.13	Therefore, if [my eating a certain] food causes my brother to stumble (sin), I will not eat [such] meat ever again, so that I will not cause my brother to stumble.
1CO.9.1	Am I not free [unrestrained and exempt from any obligation]? Am I not an apostle? Have I not 
1CO.9.2	If I am not [considered] an apostle to others, at least I am one to you; for you are the seal 
1CO.9.3	This is my defense to those who would put me on trial 
1CO.9.4	Have we not the right to our food and drink [at the expense of the churches]? 
1CO.9.5	Have we not the right to take along with us a believing wife, as do the rest of the apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas (Peter)? 
1CO.9.6	Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to stop doing manual labor [in order to support our ministry]? 
1CO.9.7	[Consider this:] Who at any time serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit? Or who tends a flock and does not use the milk of the flock?
1CO.9.8	Do I say these things only from a man’s perspective? Does the Law not endorse the same principles? 
1CO.9.9	For it is written in the Law of Moses, “Y
1CO.9.10	Or does He speak entirely for our sake? Yes, it was written for our sake: The plowman ought to plow 
1CO.9.11	If we have sown [the good seed of] spiritual things in you, is it too much if we reap material things from you? 
1CO.9.12	If others share in this rightful claim over you, do not we even more? However, we did not exercise this right, but we put up with everything so that we will not hinder [the spread of] the good news of Christ. 
1CO.9.13	Do you not know that those who officiate in the sacred services of the temple eat from the temple [offerings of meat and bread] and those who regularly attend the altar have their share from the [offerings brought to the] altar? 
1CO.9.14	So also [on the same principle] the Lord directed those who preach the gospel to get their living from the gospel.
1CO.9.15	But I have used none of these privileges, nor am I writing this [to suggest] that any such provision be made for me now. For it would be better for me to die than to have anyone deprive me of my 
1CO.9.16	For if I [merely] preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast about, for I am compelled [that is, absolutely obligated to do it]. Woe to me if I do not preach the good news [of salvation]! 
1CO.9.17	For if I do this work 
1CO.9.18	What then is my reward? [Just this:] that, when I preach the gospel, I may offer the gospel without charge [to everyone], so as not to take advantage of my rights [as a preacher and apostle] in [preaching] the gospel.
1CO.9.19	For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a slave to everyone, so that I may win more [for Christ]. 
1CO.9.20	To the Jews I became as a Jew, so that I might win Jews [for Christ]; to men under the Law, [I became] as one 
1CO.9.21	To those who are without (outside) the Law, [I became] as one without the Law, though [I am] not without the law of God, but under the law of Christ, so that I might win those who are without law. 
1CO.9.22	To the 
1CO.9.23	And I do all this for the sake of the gospel, so that I may share in its blessings along with you.
1CO.9.25	Now every athlete who [goes into training and] competes in the games is disciplined 
1CO.9.26	Therefore I do not run without a definite goal; I do not flail around like one beating the air [just shadow boxing]. 
1CO.9.27	But [like a boxer] I strictly discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after I have preached [the gospel] to others, I myself will not somehow be disqualified [as unfit for service].
1CO.10.1	For I do not want you to be unaware, believers, that our fathers were all under the cloud [in which God’s presence went before them] and they all passed [miraculously and safely] through the [Red] Sea; 
1CO.10.2	And all [of them] were baptized into Moses [into his safekeeping as their leader] in the cloud and in the sea; 
1CO.10.3	and all [of them] ate the same 
1CO.10.4	and all [of them] drank the same 
1CO.10.5	Nevertheless, God was not well-pleased with 
1CO.10.6	Now these things [the warnings and admonitions] took place as examples for us, so that we would not crave evil things as they did. 
1CO.10.7	Do not be worshipers of handmade gods, as some of them were; just as it is written [in Scripture], “T
1CO.10.8	We must not indulge in [nor tolerate] sexual immorality, as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand [suddenly] fell [dead] in a single day! 
1CO.10.9	We must not tempt the Lord [that is, test His patience, question His purpose or exploit His goodness], as some of them did—and they were killed by serpents. 
1CO.10.10	And do not murmur [in unwarranted discontent], as some of them did—and were destroyed by the 
1CO.10.11	Now these things happened to them as an example 
1CO.10.12	Therefore let the one who thinks he stands firm [immune to temptation, being overconfident and self-righteous], take care that he does not fall [into sin and condemnation]. 
1CO.10.13	No temptation [regardless of its source] has overtaken 
1CO.10.14	Therefore, my beloved, run [keep far, far away] from [any sort of] idolatry [and that includes loving anything more than God, or participating in anything that leads to sin and enslaves the soul]. 
1CO.10.15	I am speaking as to wise 
1CO.10.16	Is the cup of blessing which we bless [at the Lord’s Supper] not a sharing in the blood of Christ? [Indeed it is.] Is the bread which we break not a sharing in the body of Christ? [Indeed it is.] 
1CO.10.17	Since there is one bread, we [believers] who are many are [united into] one body; for we all partake of the one bread [which represents the body of Christ]. 
1CO.10.18	Consider the people of Israel; are those who eat the sacrifices not partners of the altar [united in their worship of the same God]? [Indeed they are.] 
1CO.10.19	What do I mean then? That a thing offered to idols is anything [special or changed simply because it is offered], or that an idol is anything? 
1CO.10.20	On the contrary, the things which the Gentiles (pagans) sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons [in effect], and not to God; and I do not want you to become partners with demons [by eating at feasts in pagan temples]. 
1CO.10.21	You cannot drink [both] the Lord’s cup and the cup of demons. You cannot share in both the Lord’s table and the table of demons [thereby becoming partners with them]. 
1CO.10.22	Do we [really] provoke the Lord to jealousy [when we eat food sacrificed to handmade “gods” at pagan feasts]? Are we [spiritually] stronger than He? [Certainly not! He knows that the idols are nothing. But we deeply 
1CO.10.23	All things are lawful [that is, morally legitimate, permissible], but not all things are beneficial 
1CO.10.24	Let no one seek [only] his own good, but [also] that of the other person. 
1CO.10.25	[Regarding meat offered to idols:] Eat anything that is sold in the meat market without asking any questions for the sake of your conscience, 
1CO.10.26	F
1CO.10.27	If one of the unbelievers invites you [to a meal at his home] and you want to go, eat whatever is served to you without asking questions [about its source] for the sake of your conscience. 
1CO.10.28	But if anyone says to you, “This meat has been offered in sacrifice to an idol,” do not eat it, out of consideration for the one who told you, and for conscience’s sake— 
1CO.10.29	and by conscience I mean for the sake of the other 
1CO.10.30	If I take my share [of food] with thankfulness, why am I accused because of something for which I give thanks?
1CO.10.31	So then, whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of [our great] God. 
1CO.10.32	Do not offend Jews or Greeks or even the church of God [but live to honor Him]; 
1CO.10.33	just as I please everyone in all things [as much as possible adapting myself to the interests of others], not seeking my own benefit but that of the many, so that they [will be open to the message of salvation and] may be saved.
1CO.11.1	Imitate me, just as I 
1CO.11.2	I praise 
1CO.11.3	But I want you to understand that Christ is the head (authority over) of every man, and man is the head of woman, and God is the head of Christ. 
1CO.11.4	Every man who prays or 
1CO.11.5	And every woman who prays or prophesies when she has her 
1CO.11.6	If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and 
1CO.11.7	A man ought not have his head covered [during worship], since he is the image and [reflected] glory of God; but the woman is [the expression of] man’s glory. 
1CO.11.8	For man does not originate from woman, but woman from man; 
1CO.11.9	for indeed man was not created for the sake of woman, but woman for the sake of man. 
1CO.11.10	Therefore the woman ought to have a 
1CO.11.11	Nevertheless, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. 
1CO.11.12	For as the woman originates from the man, so also man is born through the woman; and all things [whether male or female] originate from God [as their Creator]. 
1CO.11.13	Judge for yourselves; is it proper for a woman to offer prayer to God [publicly] with her head uncovered? 
1CO.11.14	Does not common sense itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him, 
1CO.11.15	but if a woman has long hair, it is her ornament 
1CO.11.16	Now if anyone is inclined to be contentious [about this], we have no other practice [in worship than this], nor do the churches of God [in general].
1CO.11.17	But in giving this next instruction, I do not praise you, because when you meet together it is not for the better but for the worse. 
1CO.11.18	For, in the first place, when you meet together in church, I hear that there are divisions among you; and in part I believe it, 
1CO.11.19	for [doubtless] there have to be factions among you, so that those who are of approved character may be clearly recognized among you. 
1CO.11.20	So when you meet together, it is not to eat the 
1CO.11.21	for when you eat, each one hurries to get his own supper first [not waiting for others or the poor]. So one goes hungry while another gets drunk. 
1CO.11.22	What! Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you show contempt for the church of God and humiliate those [impoverished believers] who have nothing? What will I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? In this I will not praise you!
1CO.11.24	and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, 
1CO.11.25	In the same way, after supper 
1CO.11.26	For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are [symbolically] proclaiming [the fact of] the Lord’s death until He comes [again].
1CO.11.27	So then whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in a way that is unworthy [of Him] will be guilty of [profaning and sinning against] the body and blood of the Lord. 
1CO.11.28	But a person must [prayerfully] examine himself [and his relationship to Christ], and only when he has done so should he eat of the bread and drink of the cup. 
1CO.11.29	For anyone who eats and drinks [without solemn reverence and heartfelt gratitude for the sacrifice of Christ], eats and drinks a judgment on himself if he does not 
1CO.11.30	That [careless and unworthy participation] is the reason why many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep [in death]. 
1CO.11.31	But if we evaluated 
1CO.11.32	But when we [fall short and] are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined [by undergoing His correction] so that we will not be condemned [to eternal punishment] along with the world.
1CO.11.33	So then, my brothers and sisters, when you come together to eat [the Lord’s Supper], wait for one another [and see to it that no one is left out]. 
1CO.11.34	If anyone is too hungry [to wait], let him eat at home, so that you will not come together for judgment [on yourselves]. About the remaining matters [of which I was informed], I will take care of them when I come.
1CO.12.1	Now about the spiritual 
1CO.12.2	You know that when you were pagans, 
1CO.12.3	Therefore I want you to know that no one speaking by the [power and influence of the] Spirit of God can say, “Jesus be cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is [my] Lord,” except by [the power and influence of] the Holy Spirit.
1CO.12.4	Now there are [distinctive] varieties of 
1CO.12.5	And there are [distinctive] varieties of ministries 
1CO.12.6	And there are [distinctive] ways of working [to accomplish things], but it is the same God who produces all things in all 
1CO.12.7	But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit [the spiritual illumination and the enabling of the Holy Spirit] for the common good. 
1CO.12.8	To one is given through the [Holy] Spirit [the power to speak] the message of wisdom, and to another [the power to express] the word of knowledge 
1CO.12.9	to another [wonder-working] faith [is given] by the same [Holy] Spirit, and to another the [extraordinary] gifts of healings by the one Spirit; 
1CO.12.10	and to another the working of 
1CO.12.11	All these things [the gifts, the achievements, the abilities, the empowering] are brought about by one and the same [Holy] Spirit, distributing to each one individually just as He chooses.
1CO.12.12	For just as the body is one and yet has many parts, and all the parts, though many, form [only] one body, so 
1CO.12.13	For by one [Holy] Spirit we were all baptized into one body, [spiritually transformed—united together] whether Jews or Greeks (Gentiles), slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one [Holy] Spirit [since the same Holy Spirit fills each life].
1CO.12.14	For the [human] body does not consist of one part, but of many [limbs and organs]. 
1CO.12.15	If the foot says, “Because I am not a hand, I am not 
1CO.12.16	If the ear says, “Because I am not an eye, I am not 
1CO.12.17	If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole [body] were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? 
1CO.12.18	But now [as things really are], God has placed 
1CO.12.19	If they all were a single 
1CO.12.20	But now [as things really are] there are many parts [different limbs and organs], but a single body. 
1CO.12.21	The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.” 
1CO.12.22	But quite the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are [absolutely] necessary; 
1CO.12.23	and as for those 
1CO.12.24	while our more presentable parts do not require it. But God has combined the [whole] body, giving greater honor to that part which lacks it, 
1CO.12.25	so that there would be no division 
1CO.12.26	And if one member suffers, all the parts share the suffering; if one member is honored, all rejoice with it.
1CO.12.27	Now you [collectively] are Christ’s body, and individually [you are] members of it [each with his own special purpose and function]. 
1CO.12.28	So God has appointed 
1CO.12.29	Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles? 
1CO.12.30	Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? 
1CO.12.31	But earnestly desire 
1CO.13.1	If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not 
1CO.13.2	And if I have 
1CO.13.3	If I give all my possessions to feed 
1CO.13.4	Love endures with patience 
1CO.13.5	It is not rude; it is not self-seeking, it is not provoked [nor overly sensitive and easily angered]; it does not take into account a wrong 
1CO.13.6	It does not rejoice at injustice, but rejoices with the truth [when right and truth prevail]. 
1CO.13.7	Love bears all things [regardless of what comes], believes all things [looking for the best in each one], hopes all things [remaining steadfast during difficult times], endures all things [without weakening].
1CO.13.8	Love never fails [it never fades nor ends]. But as for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for the gift of special knowledge, it will pass away. 
1CO.13.9	For we know in part, and we prophesy in part [for our knowledge is fragmentary and incomplete]. 
1CO.13.10	But when that which is complete 
1CO.13.11	When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; when I became a man, I did away with childish things. 
1CO.13.12	For now [in this time of imperfection] we see in a mirror dimly [a blurred reflection, a riddle, an enigma], but then [when the time of perfection comes we will see reality] face to face. Now I know in part [just in fragments], but then I will know fully, just as I have been fully known [by God]. 
1CO.13.13	And now there remain: faith [abiding trust in God and His promises], hope [confident expectation of eternal salvation], love [unselfish love for others growing out of God’s love for me], these three [the choicest graces]; but the greatest of these is love.
1CO.14.1	Pursue [this] love [with eagerness, make it your goal], yet earnestly desire 
1CO.14.2	For one who speaks in an 
1CO.14.3	But [on the other hand] the one who prophesies speaks to people for edification [to promote their spiritual growth] and [speaks words of] encouragement [to uphold and advise them concerning the matters of God] and [speaks words of] consolation [to compassionately comfort them]. 
1CO.14.4	One who speaks in a tongue edifies himself; but one who prophesies edifies the church [promotes growth in spiritual wisdom, devotion, holiness, and joy]. 
1CO.14.5	Now I wish that all of you spoke in 
1CO.14.6	Now, believers, if I come to you speaking in 
1CO.14.7	Yet 
1CO.14.8	And if the [war] bugle produces an indistinct sound, who will prepare himself for battle? 
1CO.14.9	So it is with you, if you speak words [in an unknown tongue] that are not intelligible 
1CO.14.10	There are, I suppose, a great many kinds of languages in the world [unknown to us], and none is lacking in meaning. 
1CO.14.11	But if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will [appear to] be a 
1CO.14.12	So it is with you, since you are so very eager to have spiritual gifts 
1CO.14.13	Therefore let one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may [be gifted to] translate 
1CO.14.14	For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unproductive [because it does not understand what my spirit is praying]. 
1CO.14.15	Then what am I to do? I will pray with the 
1CO.14.16	Otherwise if you bless [and give thanks to God] in the spirit only, how will any outsider 
1CO.14.17	You are giving thanks well enough [in a way that God is glorified], but the other person [who does not understand you] is not edified [and spiritually strengthened since he cannot join in your thanksgiving]. 
1CO.14.18	I thank God that I speak in [unknown] tongues more than all of you; 
1CO.14.19	nevertheless, in public worship I would rather say five 
1CO.14.20	Brothers and sisters, do not be children [immature, childlike] in your thinking; be infants in [matters of] evil [completely innocent and inexperienced], but in your minds be mature [adults]. 
1CO.14.21	It is written in the Law, “B
1CO.14.22	Therefore, [unknown] tongues are [meant] for a [supernatural] sign, not to believers but to unbelievers [who might be receptive]; while prophecy [foretelling the future, speaking a new message from God to the people] is not for unbelievers but for believers. 
1CO.14.23	So then, if the whole church gathers together and all of you speak in [unknown] tongues, and outsiders 
1CO.14.24	But if all prophesy [foretelling the future, speaking a new message from God to the people], and an unbeliever or outsider comes in, he is convicted [of his sins] by all, and he is called to account by all [because he can understand what is being said]; 
1CO.14.25	the secrets of his heart are laid bare. And so, falling on his face, he will worship God, declaring that God is really among you.
1CO.14.26	What then is 
1CO.14.27	If anyone speaks in a tongue, 
1CO.14.28	But if there is no one to interpret, the one [who wishes to speak in a tongue] must keep silent in church; let him speak to himself and to God. 
1CO.14.29	Let two or three prophets speak [as inspired by the Holy Spirit], while the rest pay attention 
1CO.14.30	But if an inspired revelation is made to another who is seated, then the first one must be silent. 
1CO.14.31	For [in this way] you can all prophesy one by one, so that everyone may be instructed and everyone may be encouraged; 
1CO.14.32	for the spirits of prophets are subject to the prophets [the prophecy is under the speaker’s control, and he can stop speaking]; 
1CO.14.33	for God [who is the source of their prophesying] is not 
1CO.14.34	the 
1CO.14.35	If there is anything they want to learn [that is, if they have questions about anything being said or taught], they are to ask their own husbands at home; for it is improper for a 
1CO.14.36	Did the word of the Lord originate from you [Corinthians], or has it come to you only [so that you know best what God requires]?
1CO.14.37	If anyone thinks 
1CO.14.38	If anyone does not recognize this [that it is a command of the Lord], he is not recognized [by God].
1CO.14.39	Therefore, believers, desire earnestly to prophesy [to foretell the future, to speak a new message from God to the people], and do not forbid speaking in 
1CO.14.40	But all things must be done appropriately and in an orderly manner.
1CO.15.1	Now brothers and sisters, let me remind you [once again] of the good news [of salvation] which I preached to you, which you welcomed 
1CO.15.2	By this 
1CO.15.3	For I passed on to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to [that which] the Scriptures [foretold], 
1CO.15.4	and that He was buried, and that He was [bodily] raised on the third day according to [that which] the Scriptures [foretold], 
1CO.15.5	and that He appeared to Cephas (Peter), then to the 
1CO.15.6	After that He appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time, the majority of whom are still alive, but some have fallen asleep [in death]. 
1CO.15.7	Then He was seen by James, then by all the apostles, 
1CO.15.8	and last of all, as to one 
1CO.15.9	For I am the least [worthy] of the apostles, and not fit to be called an apostle, because I [at one time] fiercely oppressed 
1CO.15.10	But by the [remarkable] grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not without effect. In fact, I worked harder than all of the apostles, though it was not I, but the grace of God [His unmerited favor and blessing which was] with me. 
1CO.15.11	So whether it was I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed 
1CO.15.12	Now if Christ is preached as raised from the dead, how is it that 
1CO.15.13	But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised; 
1CO.15.14	and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain [useless, amounting to nothing], and your faith is also vain [imaginary, unfounded, devoid of value and benefit—not based on truth]. 
1CO.15.15	We are even discovered to be false witnesses [misrepresenting] God, because we testified concerning Him that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise, if in fact the dead are not raised. 
1CO.15.16	For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised, either; 
1CO.15.17	and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless 
1CO.15.18	Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost. 
1CO.15.19	If we who are [abiding] in Christ have hoped only in this life [and this is all there is], then we are of all people most miserable 
1CO.15.20	But now [as things really are] Christ has 
1CO.15.21	For since [it was] by a man that death 
1CO.15.22	For just as 
1CO.15.23	But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then those who are Christ’s [own will be resurrected with incorruptible, immortal bodies] at His coming. 
1CO.15.24	After that comes the end (completion), when He hands over the kingdom to God the Father, after He has made inoperative 
1CO.15.25	For Christ must reign [as King] until He has put all His enemies under His feet. 
1CO.15.26	The last enemy to be abolished 
1CO.15.27	For H
1CO.15.28	However, when all things are subjected to Him (Christ), then the Son Himself will also be subjected to the One (the Father) who put all things under Him, so that God may be all in all [manifesting His glory without any opposition, the supreme indwelling and controlling factor of life].
1CO.15.29	Otherwise, what will those do who are being 
1CO.15.30	[For that matter] why are we [running such risks and putting ourselves] 
1CO.15.31	I assure you, believers, by the pride which I have in you in [your union with] Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily [I face death and die to self]. 
1CO.15.32	What good has it done me if, [merely] from a human point of view, I 
1CO.15.33	Do not be deceived: 
1CO.15.34	Be sober-minded [be sensible, wake up from your spiritual stupor] as you ought, and stop sinning; for some [of you] have no knowledge of God [you are disgracefully ignorant of Him, and ignore His truths]. I say this to your shame.
1CO.15.35	But someone will say, “How are the dead raised? And with what kind of body will they come?” 
1CO.15.36	You fool! Every time you plant 
1CO.15.37	The seed you sow is not the body (the plant) which it is going to become, but it is a bare seed, perhaps of wheat or some other grain. 
1CO.15.38	But God gives it a body just as He planned, and to each kind of seed a body of its own [is given]. 
1CO.15.39	All flesh is not the same. There is one kind for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish. 
1CO.15.40	There are also heavenly bodies [sun, moon and stars] and earthly bodies [humans, animals, and plants], but the glory 
1CO.15.41	There is a glory 
1CO.15.42	So it is with the resurrection of the dead. The [human] body that is sown is perishable 
1CO.15.43	It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in strength; 
1CO.15.44	it is sown a natural body [mortal, suited to earth], it is raised a spiritual body [immortal, suited to heaven]. As surely as there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual 
1CO.15.45	So it is written [in Scripture], “The first 
1CO.15.46	However, the spiritual [the immortal life] is not first, but the physical [the mortal life]; then the spiritual. 
1CO.15.47	The first man [Adam] is from the earth, earthy [made of dust]; the second Man [Christ, the Lord] is from heaven. 
1CO.15.48	As is the earthly man [the man of dust], so are those who are of earth; and as is the heavenly [Man], so are those who are of heaven. 
1CO.15.49	Just as we have borne the image of the earthly [the man of dust], 
1CO.15.50	Now I say this, believers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit 
1CO.15.51	Listen very carefully, I tell you a mystery [a secret truth decreed by God and previously hidden, but now revealed]; we will not all sleep [in death], but we will all be [completely] changed [wondrously transformed], 
1CO.15.52	in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at [the sound of] the last trumpet call. For a trumpet will sound, and the dead [who believed in Christ] will be raised imperishable, and we will be [completely] changed [wondrously transformed]. 
1CO.15.53	For this perishable [part of us] must put on the imperishable [nature], and this mortal [part of us that is capable of dying] must put on immortality [which is freedom from death]. 
1CO.15.54	And when this perishable puts on the imperishable, and this mortal puts on immortality, then the Scripture will be fulfilled that says, “D
1CO.15.55	O 
1CO.15.56	The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin [by which it brings death] is the law; 
1CO.15.57	but thanks be to God, who gives us the victory [as conquerors] through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1CO.15.58	Therefore, my beloved brothers and sisters, be steadfast, immovable, always excelling in the work of the Lord [always doing your best and doing more than is needed], being 
1CO.16.1	Now concerning the money collected for [the relief of] the saints [in Jerusalem], you are to do the same as I directed the churches of Galatia 
1CO.16.2	On the first day of every week each one of you is to put something aside, in proportion to his prosperity, and save it so that no collections [will need to] be made when I come. 
1CO.16.3	When I arrive, I will send whomever you approve with letters [of authorization] to take your gift [of charity and love] to Jerusalem; 
1CO.16.4	and if it is fitting for me to go too, they will accompany me.
1CO.16.5	I will visit you after I go through Macedonia, for I am only passing through Macedonia; 
1CO.16.6	but it may be that I will stay with you [for a while], or even spend the winter, so that you may send me on my way to wherever I may go 
1CO.16.7	For I do not wish to see you right now 
1CO.16.8	But I will stay in Ephesus until 
1CO.16.9	because a wide door for effective service has opened to me [in Ephesus, a very promising opportunity], and there are many adversaries.
1CO.16.10	If Timothy comes, see to it that [you put him at ease, so that] he has nothing to fear in regard to you, for he is [devotedly] doing the Lord’s work, just as I am. 
1CO.16.11	So allow no one to treat him with disdain [as if he were inconsequential]. But send him off [cordially, and speed him on his way] in peace, so that he may come to me, for I am expecting him [to come along] with the 
1CO.16.12	As for our brother Apollos, I have strongly encouraged him to visit you with the other brothers. It was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has the opportunity.
1CO.16.13	Be on guard; stand firm in your faith [in God, respecting His precepts and keeping your doctrine sound]. Act like [mature] men 
1CO.16.14	Let everything you do be done in love [motivated and inspired by God’s love for us].
1CO.16.15	Brothers and sisters, you know that 
1CO.16.16	to be subject to such leaders [treating them with courtesy and respect], and to everyone who helps in the work and labors [for the benefit of yourselves and the church]. 
1CO.16.17	I rejoice because Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus have arrived, for they have made up for your absence. 
1CO.16.18	They have refreshed my spirit as well as yours. So fully acknowledge such men 
1CO.16.19	The churches of Asia send you their greetings. Aquila and Prisca, together with the church [that meets] in their house, send you their warm greetings in the Lord. 
1CO.16.20	All the believers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
1CO.16.21	This greeting is in my own hand—Paul. 
1CO.16.22	If anyone does not love the Lord [does not obey and respect and believe in Jesus Christ and His message], he is to be accursed. Maranatha (O our Lord, come)! 
1CO.16.23	The grace of our Lord Jesus [His unmerited favor, His spiritual blessing, His profound mercy] be with you. 
1CO.16.24	My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.
2CO.1.1	Paul, an apostle (special messenger, personally chosen representative) of Christ Jesus (the Messiah) by the will of God, and Timothy 
2CO.1.2	Grace to you and peace [inner calm and spiritual well-being] from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2CO.1.3	Blessed [gratefully praised and adored] be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort, 
2CO.1.4	who comforts 
2CO.1.5	For just as Christ’s sufferings are ours in abundance [as they overflow to His followers], so also our comfort [our reassurance, our encouragement, our consolation] is abundant through Christ [it is truly more than enough to endure what we must]. 
2CO.1.6	But if we are troubled 
2CO.1.7	And our 
2CO.1.8	For we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about 
2CO.1.9	Indeed, we felt within ourselves that we had received the sentence of death [and were convinced that we would die, but this happened] so that we would not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead. 
2CO.1.10	He rescued us from so great a 
2CO.1.11	while you join in helping us by your prayers. Then thanks will be given by many persons on our behalf for the gracious gift [of deliverance] granted to us through 
2CO.1.12	This is our [reason for] proud confidence: our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world [in general], and especially toward you, with pure motives and godly sincerity, not in human wisdom, but in the grace of God [that is, His gracious lovingkindness that leads people to Christ and spiritual maturity]. 
2CO.1.13	For we write you nothing other than what you read and understand [there is no double meaning in what we say]. And I hope you will [accurately] understand [divine things] until the end; 
2CO.1.14	just as you have [already] partially understood us, [and one day will recognize] that you can be proud of us just as we are of you, in the day of our Lord Jesus.
2CO.1.15	It was with this confidence that I planned at first to visit you, so that you might receive twice a token of grace; 
2CO.1.16	that is, [I wanted] to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and [then] to come back to you [on my return] from Macedonia, and have you send me on my way to Judea. 
2CO.1.17	So then, was I indecisive 
2CO.1.18	But [as surely as] God is faithful 
2CO.1.19	For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, by me, Silvanus, and Timothy, was not “Yes” and “No,” but has proved to be “Yes” in Him [true and faithful, the divine “Yes” affirming God’s promises]. 
2CO.1.20	For as many as are the promises of God, in Christ they are [all answered] “Yes.” So through Him we say our “Amen” to the glory of God. 
2CO.1.21	Now it is God who establishes 
2CO.1.22	it is He who has also put His seal on us [that is, He has appropriated us and certified us as His] and has given us the [Holy] Spirit in our hearts as a pledge [like a security deposit to guarantee the fulfillment of His promise of eternal life].
2CO.1.23	But I call on God as my soul’s witness, that it was to spare you [pain and discouragement] that I did not come again to Corinth— 
2CO.1.24	not that we rule [like dictators] over your faith, but 
2CO.2.1	But I made up my mind not to grieve you with another painful visit. 
2CO.2.2	For if I cause you grief [by a well-deserved rebuke], who then provides me enjoyment but the very one whom I have made sad? 
2CO.2.3	And I 
2CO.2.4	For I wrote to you out of great distress and with an anguished heart, and with many tears, not to cause you sorrow but to make you realize the [overflowing] love which I have especially for you.
2CO.2.5	But if 
2CO.2.6	For such a one this punishment by the majority is sufficient, 
2CO.2.7	so instead [of further rebuke, now] you should rather [graciously] forgive and comfort 
2CO.2.8	Therefore I urge you to reinstate him in your affections 
2CO.2.9	For this was my purpose in writing, to see if you would stand the test, whether you are obedient 
2CO.2.10	If you forgive anyone anything, I too forgive [that one]; and what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of [and with the approval of] Christ, 
2CO.2.11	to keep Satan from taking advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.
2CO.2.12	Now when I arrived at Troas to 
2CO.2.13	my spirit could not rest because I did not find my brother Titus 
2CO.2.14	But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us spreads 
2CO.2.15	For we are the 
2CO.2.16	to the 
2CO.2.17	For we are not like many, [acting like merchants] peddling God’s word [shortchanging and adulterating God’s message]; but from pure [uncompromised] motives, as [commissioned and sent] from God, we speak [His message] in Christ in the sight of God.
2CO.3.1	Are we starting to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some [false teachers], letters of recommendation to you or from you? [No!] 
2CO.3.2	You are our letter [of recommendation], written in our hearts, recognized and read by everyone. 
2CO.3.3	You show that you are a letter from Christ, delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.
2CO.3.4	Such is the confidence 
2CO.3.5	Not that we are sufficiently qualified in ourselves to claim anything as 
2CO.3.6	He has qualified us [making us sufficient] as ministers of a new covenant [of salvation through Christ], not of the letter [of a written code] but of the Spirit; for the letter [of the Law] kills [by revealing sin and demanding obedience], but the Spirit gives life.
2CO.3.7	Now if the ministry of death, engraved in letters on stones [the covenant of the Law which led to death because of sin], came with such glory 
2CO.3.8	how will the ministry of the Spirit [the new covenant which allows us to be Spirit-filled] fail to be even more glorious 
2CO.3.9	For if the ministry that brings condemnation [the old covenant, the Law] has glory, how much more does glory overflow in the ministry that brings righteousness [the new covenant which declares believers free of guilt and sets them apart for God’s special purpose]! 
2CO.3.10	Indeed, what had glory [the Law], in this case no longer has glory because of the glory that surpasses it [the gospel]. 
2CO.3.11	For if that [Law] which fades away 
2CO.3.12	Since we have such a [glorious] hope 
2CO.3.13	and we are not like Moses, 
2CO.3.14	But [in fact] their minds were hardened [for they had lost the ability to understand]; for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains unlifted, because it is removed [only] in Christ. 
2CO.3.15	But to this day whenever Moses is read, a veil [of blindness] lies over their heart; 
2CO.3.16	but whenever a person turns [in repentance and faith] to the Lord, the veil is taken away. 
2CO.3.17	Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, 
2CO.3.18	And we all, with unveiled face, 
2CO.4.1	Therefore, since we have this ministry, just as we received mercy [from God, granting us salvation, opportunities, and blessings], we do not get discouraged 
2CO.4.2	But we have renounced the disgraceful things hidden because of shame; not walking in trickery or adulterating the word of God, but by stating the truth [openly and plainly], we commend ourselves to everyone’s conscience in the sight of God. 
2CO.4.3	But even if our gospel is [in some sense] hidden [behind a veil], it is hidden [only] to those who are perishing; 
2CO.4.4	among them the god of this world [Satan] has blinded the minds of the unbelieving to prevent them from seeing the illuminating light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. 
2CO.4.5	For we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves [merely] as your bond-servants for Jesus’ sake. 
2CO.4.6	For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” is the One who has shone in our hearts to give us the Light of the knowledge of the glory 
2CO.4.7	But we have this 
2CO.4.8	We are pressured in every way [hedged in], but not crushed; perplexed [unsure of finding a way out], but not driven to despair; 
2CO.4.9	hunted down 
2CO.4.10	always carrying around in the body the dying of Jesus, so that the [resurrection] life of Jesus also may be shown in our body. 
2CO.4.11	For we who live are constantly [experiencing the threat of] being handed over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the [resurrection] life of Jesus also may be evidenced in our mortal body [which is subject to death]. 
2CO.4.12	So 
2CO.4.13	Yet we have the same spirit of faith as he had, who wrote 
2CO.4.14	knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus and will present us [along] with you in His presence. 
2CO.4.15	For all [these] things are for your sake, so that as [God’s remarkable, undeserved] grace reaches to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving, to the glory of [our great] God.
2CO.4.16	Therefore we do not become discouraged [spiritless, disappointed, or afraid]. Though our outer self is [progressively] wasting away, yet our inner 
2CO.4.17	For our momentary, light distress [this passing trouble] is producing for us an eternal weight of glory [a fullness] beyond all measure [surpassing all comparisons, a transcendent splendor and an endless blessedness]! 
2CO.4.18	So we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are unseen; for the things which are visible are temporal [just brief and fleeting], but the things which are invisible are everlasting 
2CO.5.1	For we know that if the earthly tent [our physical body] which is our house is torn down [through death], we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. 
2CO.5.2	For indeed in this 
2CO.5.3	so that by putting it on we will not be found naked. 
2CO.5.4	For while we are in this tent, we groan, being burdened [often weighed down, oppressed], not that we want to be unclothed [separated by death from the body], but to be clothed, so that what is mortal [the body] will be swallowed up by life [after the resurrection]. 
2CO.5.5	Now He who has made us 
2CO.5.6	So then, being always filled with good courage 
2CO.5.7	for we walk by faith, not by sight [living our lives in a manner consistent with our confident belief in God’s promises]— 
2CO.5.8	we are [as I was saying] of good courage 
2CO.5.9	Therefore, whether we are at home [on earth] or away from home [and with Him], it is our [constant] ambition to be pleasing to Him. 
2CO.5.10	For we [believers will be called to account and] must all appear before the 
2CO.5.11	Therefore, since we know the fear of the Lord [and understand the importance of obedience and worship], we persuade people [to be reconciled to Him]. But we are plainly known to God [He knows everything about us]; and I hope that we are plainly known also in your consciences [your God-given discernment]. 
2CO.5.12	We are not commending ourselves to you again, but are giving you an occasion to be [rightfully] proud of us, so that you will have 
2CO.5.13	If we are out of our mind [just unstable fanatics as some critics say], it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for your benefit. 
2CO.5.14	For the love of Christ controls 
2CO.5.15	and He died for all, so that all those who live would no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died and was raised for their sake.
2CO.5.16	So from now on we regard no one from a human point of view [according to worldly standards and values]. Though we have known Christ from a human point of view, now we no longer know Him 
2CO.5.17	Therefore if anyone is in Christ [that is, grafted in, joined to Him by faith in Him as Savior], 
2CO.5.18	But all 
2CO.5.19	that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting people’s sins against them [but canceling them]. And He has committed to us the message of reconciliation [that is, restoration to favor with God].
2CO.5.20	So we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making His appeal through us; we [as Christ’s representatives] plead with you on behalf of Christ to be reconciled to God. 
2CO.5.21	He made Christ who knew no sin to [judicially] be sin on our behalf, so that in Him we would become the righteousness of God [that is, we would be made acceptable to Him and placed in a right relationship with Him by His gracious lovingkindness].
2CO.6.1	Working together 
2CO.6.2	For He says,
2CO.6.2	“A
2CO.6.2	A
2CO.6.2	Behold, now is “
2CO.6.3	we put no obstruction in anyone’s path, so that the ministry will not be discredited, 
2CO.6.4	but we commend ourselves in every way as servants of God: in great endurance, in sufferings, in hardships, in distresses, 
2CO.6.5	in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in sleepless nights, in hunger, 
2CO.6.6	in purity 
2CO.6.7	in [speaking] the word of truth, in the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness for the right hand [like holding the sword to attack] and for the left [like holding the shield to defend], 
2CO.6.8	amid glory and dishonor; by evil report and good report; 
2CO.6.9	as unknown [to the world], yet well-known [by God and His people]; as dying, yet we live; as punished, yet not killed; 
2CO.6.10	as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet bestowing riches on many; as having nothing, yet possessing all things.
2CO.6.11	We are speaking freely to you, Corinthians [we are keeping nothing back], and our heart is opened wide. 
2CO.6.12	There is no limit to our affection for you, but you are limited in your own affection [for us]. 
2CO.6.13	Now in the same way as a fair exchange [for our love toward you]—I am speaking as [I would] to children—open wide [your hearts] 
2CO.6.14	Do not be unequally bound together with unbelievers [do not make mismatched alliances with them, inconsistent with your faith]. For what partnership can righteousness have with lawlessness? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? 
2CO.6.15	What harmony can there be between Christ and Belial (Satan)? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? 
2CO.6.16	What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God; just as God said:
2CO.6.16	“I 
2CO.6.16	A
2CO.6.17	So 
2CO.6.17	“A
2CO.6.17	And I will graciously receive you 
2CO.6.18	And I will be a Father to you,
2CO.6.18	And you will be My sons and daughters,”
2CO.6.18	Says the Lord Almighty.
2CO.7.1	Therefore, since we have these [great and wonderful] promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, completing holiness [living a consecrated life—a life set apart for God’s purpose] in the fear of God.
2CO.7.2	Make room for us 
2CO.7.3	I do not say 
2CO.7.4	Great is my confidence in you; great is my pride 
2CO.7.5	For even when we arrived in Macedonia our bodies had no rest, but we were oppressed at every turn—conflicts 
2CO.7.6	But God, who comforts 
2CO.7.7	And not only by his arrival, but also by [his account of] the encouragement which he received in regard to you. He told us about your longing [for us], your mourning [over sin], 
2CO.7.8	For even though I did grieve you with my 
2CO.7.9	yet I am glad now, not because you were hurt 
2CO.7.10	For [godly] sorrow that is in accord with 
2CO.7.11	For [you can look back and] see what an earnestness 
2CO.7.12	So even though I wrote to you [as I did], it was not for the sake of the offender nor for the sake of the one offended, but in order to make evident to you before God how earnestly you do care for us [and your willingness to accept our authority]. 
2CO.7.13	It is for this reason that we are comforted 
2CO.7.14	For if I have boasted to him at all concerning you, I was not disappointed. But just as everything we ever said to you was true, so our boasting [about you] to Titus has proved true also. 
2CO.7.15	His affection is greater than ever as he remembers the obedience [to his guidance] that all of you exhibited, and how you received him with the greatest respect. 
2CO.7.16	I rejoice that in everything I have [perfect] confidence in you.
2CO.8.1	Now, brothers and sisters, we want to tell you about the grace of God which has been evident in the churches of Macedonia [awakening in them a longing to contribute]; 
2CO.8.2	for during an ordeal of severe distress, their abundant joy and their deep poverty [together] overflowed in the wealth of their lavish generosity. 
2CO.8.3	For I testify that according to their ability, and beyond their ability, 
2CO.8.4	begging us insistently for the privilege of participating in the service for [the support of] the saints [in Jerusalem]. 
2CO.8.5	Not only [did they give materially] as we had hoped, but first they gave themselves to the Lord and to us [as His representatives] by the will of God [disregarding their personal interests and giving as much as they possibly could]. 
2CO.8.6	So we urged Titus that, as he began it, he should also complete this gracious work among you as well.
2CO.8.7	But just as you excel in everything, [and lead the way] in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in genuine concern, and in your love for us, see that you excel in this gracious work [of giving] also. 
2CO.8.8	I am not saying 
2CO.8.9	For you are recognizing [more clearly] the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [His astonishing kindness, His generosity, His gracious favor], that though He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, so that by His poverty you might become rich (abundantly blessed). 
2CO.8.10	I give you 
2CO.8.11	So now finish this, so that your eagerness in desiring it may be equaled by your completion of it, according to your ability. 
2CO.8.12	For if the eagerness [to give] is there, it is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what he does not have. 
2CO.8.13	For it is not [intended] that others be relieved [of their responsibility] and that you be 
2CO.8.14	at this present time your surplus [over necessities] 
2CO.8.15	as it is written [in Scripture], “H
2CO.8.16	But thanks be to God who puts the same genuine concern for you in the heart of Titus. 
2CO.8.17	For Titus not only accepted our appeal, but was so very interested in you that he has gone to 
2CO.8.18	And we have sent along with him the 
2CO.8.19	and not only 
2CO.8.20	We are taking precaution so that no one will [find anything with which to] discredit us in our administration of this generous gift. 
2CO.8.21	For we have regard for what is honorable [and above suspicion], not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. 
2CO.8.22	We have sent with them our brother, whom we have often tested and found to be diligent in many things, but who is now even more diligent [than ever] because of his great confidence in you. 
2CO.8.23	As for Titus, 
2CO.8.24	Therefore, show these men, in the sight of the churches, the proof of your love and our reason for being proud of you.
2CO.9.1	Now it is unnecessary for me to write to you about the offering [that is to be made] for the saints [in Jerusalem]; 
2CO.9.2	for I know your eagerness [to promote this cause], and I have [proudly] boasted to the people of Macedonia about it, telling them that 
2CO.9.3	Still, I am sending the brothers [on to you], so that our pride in you may not be an empty boast in this case, and so that you may be prepared, just as I told them you would be; 
2CO.9.4	otherwise, if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we—to say nothing of yourselves—will be humiliated for being so confident. 
2CO.9.5	That is why I thought it necessary to urge these brothers to go to you [before I come] and make arrangements in advance for this generous, previously promised gift of yours, so that it would be ready, not as something extorted [or wrung out of you], but as a [voluntary and] generous gift.
2CO.9.6	Now [remember] this: he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows 
2CO.9.7	Let each one give [thoughtfully and with purpose] just as he has decided in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver [and delights in the one whose heart is in his gift]. 
2CO.9.8	And God is able to make all grace [every favor and earthly blessing] come in abundance to you, so that you may always [under all circumstances, regardless of the need] have complete sufficiency in everything [being completely self-sufficient in Him], and have an abundance for every good work 
2CO.9.9	As it is written 
2CO.9.9	“H
2CO.9.9	H
2CO.9.10	Now He who provides seed for the sower and bread for food will provide and multiply your seed for sowing [that is, your resources] and increase the harvest of your righteousness [which shows itself in active goodness, kindness, and love]. 
2CO.9.11	You will be enriched in every way so that you may be generous, and this [generosity, administered] through us is producing thanksgiving to God [from those who benefit]. 
2CO.9.12	For the ministry of this service (offering) is not only supplying the needs of the saints (God’s people), but is also overflowing through many expressions of thanksgiving to God. 
2CO.9.13	Because of this act of ministry, 
2CO.9.14	and they also long for you while they pray on your behalf, because of the surpassing measure of God’s grace [His undeserved favor, mercy, and blessing which is revealed] in you. 
2CO.9.15	Now thanks be to God for His indescribable gift [which is precious beyond words]!
2CO.10.1	Now I, Paul, urge you by the gentleness and graciousness of Christ—I who am meek [so they say] when with you face to face, but bold [outspoken and fearless] toward you when absent! 
2CO.10.2	I ask that when I do come I will not be driven to the boldness that I intend to show toward those few who regard us as if we walked according to the flesh [like men without the Spirit]. 
2CO.10.3	For though we walk in the flesh [as mortal men], we are not carrying on our [spiritual] warfare according to the flesh 
2CO.10.4	The weapons of our warfare are not physical [weapons of flesh and blood]. Our weapons are divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. 
2CO.10.5	 destroying sophisticated arguments and every exalted 
2CO.10.6	being ready to punish every act of disobedience, when your own obedience [as a church] is complete.
2CO.10.7	You are looking [only] at the outward appearance of things. If anyone is confident that he is Christ’s, he should reflect 
2CO.10.8	For even though I boast rather freely about the authority the Lord gave us for building you up and not for destroying you, I will not be ashamed [of the truth], 
2CO.10.9	nor do I want to seem to be trying to frighten you with my letters; 
2CO.10.10	for they say, “His letters are weighty and forceful 
2CO.10.11	Let such people realize that what we say by word in letters when we are absent, is the same as what 
2CO.10.12	We do not have the audacity to put ourselves in the same class or compare ourselves with some who [supply testimonials to] commend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they lack wisdom 
2CO.10.13	We, on the other hand, will not boast beyond our proper limit, but [will keep] within the 
2CO.10.14	We are not overstepping the limits of our province, as if we did not [legitimately] reach to you, for we were the [very] first to come even as far as you with the good news of Christ. 
2CO.10.15	We do not go beyond our proper limit, boasting in the work of other men, but we have the hope that as your faith [in Christ and His divine power] continues to grow, our field among you may be greatly expanded [but still within the limits of our commission], 
2CO.10.16	so that 
2CO.10.17	However, “L
2CO.10.18	For it is not he who commends 
2CO.11.1	I wish you would bear with me [while I indulge] in a little foolishness; but indeed you are bearing with me [as you read this]. 
2CO.11.2	I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy because I have promised you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ. 
2CO.11.3	But I am afraid that, even as the serpent beguiled Eve by his cunning, your minds may be corrupted 
2CO.11.4	For [you seem willing to allow it] if one comes and preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted. You tolerate all this beautifully [welcoming the deception]. 
2CO.11.5	Yet I consider myself in no way inferior to the [so-called] 
2CO.11.6	But even if I am unskilled in speaking, yet I am not [untrained] in 
2CO.11.7	Or did I [perhaps] sin by humbling myself so that you might be exalted 
2CO.11.8	I robbed other churches by accepting [more than their share of] financial support for my ministry to you. 
2CO.11.9	And when I was with you and ran short [financially], I did not burden any of you; for what I needed was fully supplied by the brothers (Silas and Timothy) who came from Macedonia (the church at Philippi). So I kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so. 
2CO.11.10	As the truth of Christ is in me, my boast [of independence] will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia (southern Greece). 
2CO.11.11	Why? Because I do not love you [or wish you well, or have regard for your welfare]? God knows [that I do]!
2CO.11.12	But what I am doing I will keep doing, [for I am determined to keep this independence] in order to cut off the claim of those who want an opportunity to be regarded just as we are in the things they brag about. 
2CO.11.13	For such men are counterfeit apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles of Christ. 
2CO.11.14	And no wonder, since Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. 
2CO.11.15	So it is no great surprise if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness, but their end will correspond with their deeds.
2CO.11.16	I repeat then, let no one think that I am foolish; but even if you do, at least accept me as foolish, so that I too may boast a little. 
2CO.11.17	What I say in this confident boasting, I say not as the Lord would [with His authority], but foolishly. 
2CO.11.18	Since many boast [of worldly things and brag] about human accomplishments, I will boast too. 
2CO.11.19	For you, being so wise, gladly tolerate 
2CO.11.20	For you tolerate it if anyone makes you his slave; or devours you 
2CO.11.21	To my shame, I must say, we have been too weak [in comparison to those pseudo-apostles who take advantage of you].
2CO.11.22	Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I. 
2CO.11.23	Are they [self-proclaimed] servants of Christ?—I am speaking as if I were out of my mind—I am more so [for I exceed them]; with far more labors, with far more imprisonments, beaten times without number, and often in danger of death. 
2CO.11.24	Five times I received from the Jews 
2CO.11.25	Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked, a night and a day I have spent 
2CO.11.26	many times on journeys, [exposed to] danger from rivers, danger from bandits, danger from my own countrymen, danger from the Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger on the sea, danger among those posing as believers; 
2CO.11.27	in labor and hardship, often unable to sleep, in hunger and thirst, often [driven to] fasting [for lack of food], in cold and exposure [without adequate clothing]. 
2CO.11.28	Besides those external things, there is the daily [inescapable] pressure of my concern for all the churches. 
2CO.11.29	Who is weak, and I do not feel [his] weakness? Who is made to sin, and I am not on fire [with sorrow and concern]?
2CO.11.30	If I must boast, I will boast of the things that reveal my weakness [the things by which I am made weak in the eyes of my opponents]. 
2CO.11.31	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, He who is blessed 
2CO.11.32	In Damascus the 
2CO.11.33	and I was [actually] let down in a basket through a 
2CO.12.1	It is necessary to boast, though nothing is gained by it; but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. 
2CO.12.2	I know a 
2CO.12.3	And I know that such a man—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, [only] God knows— 
2CO.12.4	was caught up into 
2CO.12.5	On behalf of such a man [and his experiences] I will boast; but in my own behalf I will not boast, except in regard to my weaknesses. 
2CO.12.6	If I wish to boast, I will not be foolish, because I will be speaking the truth. But I abstain [from it], so that no one will credit me with more than [is justified by what] he sees in me or hears from me.
2CO.12.7	Because of the surpassing greatness 
2CO.12.8	Concerning this I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might leave me; 
2CO.12.9	but He has said to me, 
2CO.12.10	So I am well pleased with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses, with persecutions, and with difficulties, for the sake of Christ; for when I am weak [in human strength], then I am strong [truly able, truly powerful, truly drawing from God’s strength].
2CO.12.11	Now I have become foolish; you have forced me [by questioning my apostleship]. Actually I should have been commended by you [instead of being treated disdainfully], for I was not inferior to those 
2CO.12.12	The signs that indicate a genuine apostle were performed among you fully 
2CO.12.13	For in what respect were you treated as inferior to the rest of the churches, except [for the fact] that I did not burden you [with my financial support]? Forgive me [for doing you] this injustice!
2CO.12.14	Now for the third time I am ready to visit you. I will not burden you [financially], because I do not want what is yours [not your money or your possessions], but you. For children are not responsible to save up for their parents, but parents for their children. 
2CO.12.15	But I will very gladly spend [my own resources] and be utterly spent for your souls. If I love you greatly, am I to be loved less [by you]? 
2CO.12.16	But be that as it may, I did not burden you [with my support]. But [some say that] I was sly and took you by trickery. 
2CO.12.17	Did I take advantage of you 
2CO.12.18	I urged Titus to go, and I sent the brother with him. Titus did not take advantage of you, did he? [No!] Did we not conduct ourselves in the same spirit and walk in the same steps? [Of course!]
2CO.12.19	All this time you have been thinking that we are [merely] defending ourselves to you. It is in the sight of God that we have been speaking [as one] in Christ; and everything, dearly beloved, is to strengthen you [spiritually]. 
2CO.12.20	For I am afraid that perhaps when I come I may find you not to be as I wish, and that you may find me not as you wish—that perhaps 
2CO.12.21	I am afraid that when I come again my God may humiliate me before you, and I may mourn over many of those who have sinned in the past and not repented of the impurity, sexual immorality and decadence which they formerly practiced.
2CO.13.1	This is the third time that I am visiting you. E
2CO.13.2	I have already warned those who have sinned in the past and all the rest 
2CO.13.3	since you seek [forensic] proof that Christ is speaking in 
2CO.13.4	For even though He was crucified in weakness [yielding Himself], yet He lives [resurrected] by the power of God [His Father]. For we too are weak in Him [as He was humanly weak], yet we are alive 
2CO.13.5	Test 
2CO.13.6	But I hope you will acknowledge that we do not fail the test 
2CO.13.7	But I pray to God that you may do nothing wrong. Not so that we [and our teaching] may appear to be approved, but that you may continue doing what is right, even though we [by comparison] may seem to have failed. 
2CO.13.8	For we can do nothing against the truth, but only for the truth [and the gospel—the good news of salvation]. 
2CO.13.9	We are glad when we are weak [since God’s power comes freely through us], but you [by comparison] are strong. We also pray for this, that you be made complete [fully restored, growing and maturing in godly character and spirit—pleasing your heavenly Father by the life you live]. 
2CO.13.10	For this reason I am writing these things while absent from you, so that when I come, I will not need to deal severely [with you], in my use of the authority which the Lord has given me [to be used] for building you up and not for tearing you down.
2CO.13.11	Finally, believers, rejoice! Be made complete [be what you should be], be comforted, be like-minded, live in peace [enjoy the spiritual well-being experienced by believers who walk closely with God]; and the God of love and peace [the source of lovingkindness] will be with you. 
2CO.13.12	Greet one another with a 
2CO.13.13	All 
2CO.13.14	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
GAL.1.1	Paul, an apostle (not commissioned 
GAL.1.2	and all the brothers who are with me,
GAL.1.3	Grace to you and peace [inner calm and spiritual well-being] from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, 
GAL.1.4	who gave Himself [as a sacrifice to atone] for our sins [to save and sanctify us] so that He might rescue us from this present evil 
GAL.1.5	to Him be [ascribed all] the glory through the ages of the ages. Amen.
GAL.1.6	I am astonished 
GAL.1.7	which is really not another [gospel]; but there are [obviously] 
GAL.1.8	But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to that which we [originally] preached to you, let him be condemned to destruction! 
GAL.1.9	As we have said before, so I now say again, if anyone is preaching to you a gospel different from that which you received [from us], let him be condemned to destruction!
GAL.1.10	Am I now 
GAL.1.11	For I want you to know, 
GAL.1.12	For indeed I did not receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but 
GAL.1.13	You have heard of my career 
GAL.1.14	And [you have heard how] I surpassed many of my contemporaries among my countrymen in [my advanced study of the laws of] Judaism, as I was extremely loyal to the traditions of my ancestors. 
GAL.1.15	But when God, who had chosen me 
GAL.1.16	to reveal His Son in me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles [as the good news—the way of salvation], I did not immediately consult with 
GAL.1.17	Nor did I [even] go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went to Arabia 
GAL.1.18	Then three years later I did go up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Cephas (Peter), and I stayed with him fifteen days. 
GAL.1.19	But I did not see any other apostle except James, the [half] brother of the Lord. 
GAL.1.20	(Now in what I am writing to you, I assure you as if I were standing before God that I am not lying.) 
GAL.1.21	Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. 
GAL.1.22	And I was still unknown by sight to the churches which were in Christ in Judea (Jerusalem and the surrounding region); 
GAL.1.23	they only kept hearing, “He who used to persecute us is now preaching the [good news of the] faith which he once was trying to destroy.” 
GAL.1.24	And they were glorifying God [as the Author and Source of what had taken place and all that had been accomplished] in me.
GAL.2.1	Then after a period of fourteen years I again went up to Jerusalem, [this time] with Barnabas, taking Titus along also. 
GAL.2.2	I went up [to Jerusalem] because of a [divine] revelation, and I put before them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles. But 
GAL.2.3	But [all went well, for] not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled [as some had anticipated] to be circumcised, despite the fact that he was a Greek. 
GAL.2.4	My concern was because of the 
GAL.2.5	But we did not yield to them even for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel would continue to remain with you [in its purity]. 
GAL.2.6	But from those who were of high reputation (whatever they were—in terms of individual importance—makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality—He is not impressed with the positions that people hold nor does He recognize distinctions such as fame or power)—well, those who were of reputation contributed nothing to me [that is, they had nothing to add to my gospel message nor did they impose any new requirements on me]. 
GAL.2.7	But on the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised (Gentiles), just as Peter 
GAL.2.8	(for He who worked effectively for Peter 
GAL.2.9	And recognizing the grace [that God had] bestowed on me, James and Cephas (Peter) and John, who were reputed to be pillars [of the Jerusalem church], gave to me and Barnabas the 
GAL.2.10	 only [one thing], that we remember the poor, the very thing I was also eager to do.
GAL.2.11	Now when Cephas (Peter) came to Antioch, I opposed him face to face [about his conduct there], because he stood condemned [by his own actions]. 
GAL.2.12	Before certain men came from James, he used to eat [his meals] with the Gentiles; but when the men [from Jerusalem] arrived, he 
GAL.2.13	The rest of the Jews joined him in this hypocrisy [ignoring their knowledge that Jewish and Gentile Christians were united, under the new covenant, into one faith], with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy. 
GAL.2.14	But when I saw that they were not being straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I told Cephas (Peter) in front of everyone, “If you, being a Jew, live [as you have been living] like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how is it that you are [now virtually] forcing the Gentiles to live like Jews [if they want to eat with you]?”
GAL.2.15	[I went on to say] “We are Jews by birth and not sinners from among the Gentiles; 
GAL.2.16	yet we know that a man is not 
GAL.2.17	But if, while we seek to be justified in Christ [by faith], we ourselves are found to be sinners, does that make Christ an advocate 
GAL.2.18	For if I [or anyone else should] rebuild [through word or by practice] what I once tore down [the belief that observing the Law is essential for salvation], I prove myself to be a transgressor. 
GAL.2.19	For through the Law I died to the Law 
GAL.2.20	I have been crucified with Christ [that is, in Him I have shared His crucifixion]; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. The 
GAL.2.21	I do not ignore 
GAL.3.1	O you foolish 
GAL.3.2	This is all I want to ask of you: did you receive the [Holy] Spirit as the result of obeying [the requirements of] the Law, or was it the result of hearing [the message of salvation and] with faith [believing it]? 
GAL.3.3	Are you so foolish 
GAL.3.4	Have you suffered so many things 
GAL.3.5	So then, does He who supplies you with His [marvelous Holy] Spirit and works miracles among you, do it as a result of the works of the Law [which you perform], or because you [believe confidently in the message which you] heard with faith?
GAL.3.6	Just as Abraham 
GAL.3.7	So understand that it is the people who live by faith [with confidence in the power and goodness of God] who are [the true] sons of 
GAL.3.8	The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, proclaimed the good news [of the Savior] to Abraham in advance [with this promise], 
GAL.3.9	So then those who are people of faith [whether Jew or Gentile] are blessed 
GAL.3.10	For all who depend on the Law [seeking justification and salvation by obedience to the Law and the observance of rituals] are under a curse; for it is written, “C
GAL.3.11	Now it is clear that no one is justified [that is, declared free of the guilt of sin and its penalty, and placed in right standing] before God by the Law, for “T
GAL.3.12	But the Law does not rest on 
GAL.3.13	Christ purchased our freedom 
GAL.3.14	in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might also come to the Gentiles, so that we would all receive [the realization of] the promise of the [Holy] Spirit through faith.
GAL.3.15	Brothers and sisters, I speak in terms of human relations: even though a last will and testament is just a human covenant, yet when it has been signed 
GAL.3.16	Now the promises [in the covenants] were decreed to Abraham and to his seed. God does not say, “And to seeds (descendants, heirs),” as if [referring] to many [persons], but as to one, “And to your Seed,” who is [none other than] Christ. 
GAL.3.17	This is what I mean: the Law, which came into existence four hundred and thirty years later [after the covenant concerning the coming Messiah], does not 
GAL.3.18	For if the inheritance [of what was promised] is based on [observing] the Law [as these false teachers claim], it is no longer based on a promise; however, God granted it to Abraham [as a gift] by virtue of His promise.
GAL.3.19	Why, then, the Law [what was its purpose]? It was added [after the promise to Abraham, to reveal to people their guilt] because of transgressions [that is, to make people conscious of the sinfulness of sin], and [the Law] was ordained through angels 
GAL.3.20	Now the mediator 
GAL.3.21	Is the Law then contrary to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a 
GAL.3.22	But the Scripture has imprisoned 
GAL.3.23	Now before faith came, we were kept in custody under the Law, [perpetually] imprisoned [in preparation] for the faith that was destined to be revealed, 
GAL.3.24	with the result that the Law has become our tutor 
GAL.3.25	But now that faith has come, we are no longer under [the control and authority of] a tutor 
GAL.3.26	For you [who are born-again have been reborn from above—spiritually transformed, renewed, sanctified and] are all children of God [set apart for His purpose with full rights and privileges] through faith in Christ Jesus. 
GAL.3.27	For all of you who were baptized into Christ [into a spiritual union with the Christ, the Anointed] have clothed yourselves with Christ [that is, you have taken on His characteristics and values]. 
GAL.3.28	There is [now no distinction in regard to salvation] neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you [who believe] are all one in Christ Jesus [no one can claim a spiritual superiority]. 
GAL.3.29	And if you belong to Christ [if you are in Him], then you are Abraham’s descendants, and [spiritual] heirs according to [God’s] promise.
GAL.4.1	Now what I mean [when I talk about children and their guardians] is this: as long as the heir is a child, he does not differ at all from a slave even though he is the [future owner and] master of all [the estate]; 
GAL.4.2	but he is under [the authority of] guardians and household administrators 
GAL.4.3	So also we [whether Jews or Gentiles], when we were children (spiritually immature), were kept like slaves under the elementary [man-made religious or philosophical] teachings of the world. 
GAL.4.4	But when [in God’s plan] the proper time had fully come, God sent His Son, born of a woman, born under the [regulations of the] Law, 
GAL.4.5	so that He might redeem 
GAL.4.6	And because you [really] are [His] sons, God has sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying out, 
GAL.4.7	Therefore you are no longer a slave (bond-servant), but a son; and if a son, then also an heir through [the gracious act of] God [through Christ].
GAL.4.8	But at that time, when you did not know [the true] God 
GAL.4.9	Now, however, since you have come to know [the true] God [through personal experience], or rather to be known by God, how is it that you are turning back again to the weak and worthless elemental principles [of religions and philosophies], to which you want to be enslaved all over again? 
GAL.4.10	[For example,] you observe [particular] days and months and seasons and years. 
GAL.4.11	I fear for you, that perhaps I have labored [to the point of exhaustion] over you in vain.
GAL.4.12	Believers, I beg of you, become as I am [free from the bondage of Jewish ritualism and ordinances], for I 
GAL.4.13	On the contrary, you know that it was because of a physical illness that I [remained and] preached the gospel to you the first time; 
GAL.4.14	and even though my physical condition was a trial to you, you did not regard it with contempt, or scorn 
GAL.4.15	What then has become of that sense of blessing 
GAL.4.16	So have I become your enemy by telling you the truth? 
GAL.4.17	These men [the Judaizers] eagerly seek you [to entrap you with honeyed words and attention, to win you over to their philosophy], not honorably [for their purpose is not honorable or worthy of consideration]. They want to isolate you [from us who oppose them] so that you will seek them. 
GAL.4.18	Now it is always pleasant to be eagerly sought after [provided that it is] for a good purpose, and not just when I am with you [seeking you myself—but beware of the others doing it]. 
GAL.4.19	My little children, for whom I am again in [the pains of] labor until Christ is [completely and permanently] formed within you— 
GAL.4.20	how I wish that I were with you now and could change my tone, because I am perplexed in regard to you.
GAL.4.21	Tell me, you who are bent on being under the Law, do you not listen to [what] the Law [really says]? 
GAL.4.22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman [Hagar] and one by the free woman [Sarah]. 
GAL.4.23	But the child of the slave woman was born according to the flesh 
GAL.4.24	Now these facts are about to be used [by me] as an allegory [that is, I will illustrate by using them]: for these 
GAL.4.25	Now Hagar is (represents) Mount Sinai in Arabia and she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children. 
GAL.4.26	But the Jerusalem above [that is, the way of faith, represented by Sarah] is free; she is our mother. 
GAL.4.27	For it is written [in the Scriptures],
GAL.4.27	“R
GAL.4.27	B
GAL.4.27	F
GAL.4.27	T
GAL.4.28	And we, [believing] brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children [not merely of physical descent, like Ishmael, but are children born] of promise [born miraculously]. 
GAL.4.29	But as at that time the child [of ordinary birth] born according to the flesh persecuted the son 
GAL.4.30	But what does the Scripture say?
GAL.4.30	“C
GAL.4.30	F
GAL.4.31	So then, believers, we [who are born again—reborn from above—spiritually transformed, renewed, and set apart for His purpose] are not children of a slave woman [the natural], but of the free woman [the supernatural].
GAL.5.1	It was for this freedom that Christ set us free [completely liberating us]; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery [which you once removed].
GAL.5.2	Notice, it is I, Paul, who tells you that if you receive circumcision [as a supposed requirement of salvation], Christ will be of no benefit to you [for you will lack the faith in Christ that is necessary for salvation]. 
GAL.5.3	Once more I solemnly affirm to every man who receives circumcision [as a supposed requirement of salvation], that he is under obligation 
GAL.5.4	You have been severed from Christ, if you seek to be 
GAL.5.5	For we [not relying on the Law but] through the [strength and power of the Holy] Spirit, by faith, are waiting [confidently] for the hope of righteousness [the completion of our salvation]. 
GAL.5.6	For [if we are] in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but only faith activated 
GAL.5.7	You were running [the race] well; who has interfered 
GAL.5.8	This [deceptive] persuasion is not from Him who called you [to freedom in Christ]. 
GAL.5.9	A little 
GAL.5.10	I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will adopt no other view [contrary to mine on the matter]; but the one who is disturbing you, whoever he is, will have to bear the penalty. 
GAL.5.11	But as for me, 
GAL.5.12	I wish that those who are troubling you [by teaching that circumcision is necessary for salvation] would even [go all the way and] castrate themselves!
GAL.5.13	For you, my brothers, were called to freedom; only do not let your freedom 
GAL.5.14	For the whole Law [concerning human relationships] is fulfilled in one precept, “Y
GAL.5.15	But if you bite and devour one another [in bickering and strife], watch out that you [along with your entire fellowship] are not consumed by one another.
GAL.5.16	But I say, walk 
GAL.5.17	For the sinful nature has its desire which is opposed to the Spirit, and the [desire of the] Spirit opposes the 
GAL.5.18	But if you are guided 
GAL.5.19	Now the practices of the 
GAL.5.20	idolatry, 
GAL.5.21	envy, drunkenness, riotous behavior, and 
GAL.5.22	But the fruit of the Spirit [the result of His presence within us] is love [unselfish concern for others], joy, [inner] peace, patience [not the ability to wait, but how we act while waiting], kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 
GAL.5.23	gentleness, self-control. Against such things there is no law. 
GAL.5.24	And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the 
GAL.5.25	If we [claim to] live by the [Holy] Spirit, we must also walk by the Spirit [with personal integrity, godly character, and moral courage—our conduct empowered by the Holy Spirit]. 
GAL.5.26	We must not become conceited, challenging 
GAL.6.1	Brothers, if anyone is caught in any sin, you who are spiritual [that is, you who are responsive to the guidance of the Spirit] are to restore such a person in a spirit of gentleness [not with a sense of superiority or self-righteousness], keeping a watchful eye on yourself, so that you are not tempted as well. 
GAL.6.2	Carry one another’s burdens and in this way you will fulfill the requirements of the law of Christ [that is, the law of Christian love]. 
GAL.6.3	For if anyone thinks he is something [special] when [in fact] he is nothing [special except in his own eyes], he deceives himself. 
GAL.6.4	But each one must carefully scrutinize his own work [examining his actions, attitudes, and behavior], and then he can have the personal satisfaction and inner joy of doing something commendable 
GAL.6.5	For every person will have to bear [with patience] his own burden [of faults and shortcomings for which he alone is responsible].
GAL.6.6	The one who is taught the word [of God] is to share all good things with his teacher [contributing to his spiritual and material support]. 
GAL.6.7	Do not be deceived, God is not mocked [He will not allow Himself to be ridiculed, nor treated with contempt nor allow His precepts to be scornfully set aside]; for whatever a man sows, this 
GAL.6.8	For the one who sows to his flesh [his sinful capacity, his worldliness, his disgraceful impulses] will reap from the flesh ruin 
GAL.6.9	Let us not grow weary 
GAL.6.10	So then, while we [as individual believers] have the opportunity, let us do good to all people [not only being helpful, but also doing that which promotes their spiritual well-being], and especially [be a blessing] to those of the household of faith (born-again believers).
GAL.6.11	See with what 
GAL.6.12	Those who want to make a good impression in public [before the Jews] try to compel you to be circumcised, just so they will escape being persecuted for [faithfulness to] the cross of Christ. 
GAL.6.13	For even the circumcised [Jews] themselves do not [really] keep the Law, but they want to have you circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh [that is, in the fact that they convinced you to be circumcised]. 
GAL.6.14	But far be it from me to boast [in anything or anyone], except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. 
GAL.6.15	For neither is circumcision anything [of any importance], nor uncircumcision, but [only] a new creation [which is the result of a new birth—a spiritual transformation—a new nature in Christ Jesus]. 
GAL.6.16	Peace and mercy be upon all who walk by this rule [who discipline themselves and conduct their lives by this principle], and upon the [true] Israel of God (Jewish believers).
GAL.6.17	From now on let no one trouble me [by making it necessary for me to justify my authority as an apostle, and the absolute truth of the gospel], for I bear on my body the 
GAL.6.18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, my 
EPH.1.1	Paul, an apostle (special messenger, personally chosen representative) of Christ Jesus (the Messiah, the Anointed), by the will of God [that is, by His purpose and choice],
EPH.1.2	Grace to you and peace [inner calm and spiritual well-being] from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
EPH.1.4	just as [in His love] He chose us in Christ [actually selected us for Himself as His own] before the foundation of the world, so that we would be holy [that is, consecrated, set apart for Him, purpose-driven] and blameless in His sight. In love 
EPH.1.5	He predestined 
EPH.1.6	to the praise of His glorious grace 
EPH.1.7	In Him we have redemption [that is, our deliverance and salvation] through His blood, [which paid the penalty for our sin and resulted in] the forgiveness 
EPH.1.8	which He lavished on us. In all wisdom and understanding [with practical insight] 
EPH.1.9	He made known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Christ, 
EPH.1.10	with regard to the fulfillment of the times [that is, the end of history, the climax of the ages]—to bring all things together in Christ, [both] things in the heavens and things on the earth. 
EPH.1.11	In Him also we have 
EPH.1.12	so that we who were the first to hope in Christ [who first put our confidence in Him as our Lord and Savior] would exist to the praise of His glory. 
EPH.1.13	In Him, you also, when you heard the word of truth, the good news of your salvation, and [as a result] believed in Him, were stamped with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit [the One promised by Christ] as owned 
EPH.1.14	The Spirit is the 
EPH.1.15	For this reason, because I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all 
EPH.1.16	I do not cease to give thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers; 
EPH.1.17	[I always pray] that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may grant you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation [that gives you a deep and personal and intimate insight] into the true knowledge of Him [for we know the Father through the Son]. 
EPH.1.18	And [I pray] that the eyes of your heart [the very center and core of your being] may be enlightened [flooded with light by the Holy Spirit], so that you will know 
EPH.1.19	and [so that you will begin to know] what the immeasurable 
EPH.1.20	which He 
EPH.1.21	far above all rule and authority and power and dominion [whether angelic or human], and [far above] every name that is named [above every title that can be conferred], not only in this age 
EPH.1.22	And He 
EPH.1.23	which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills 
EPH.2.1	And you [He made alive when you] were [spiritually] dead 
EPH.2.2	in which you once walked. You were following the ways of this world [influenced by this present age], in accordance with the prince of the power of the air (Satan), the spirit who is now at work in the disobedient [the unbelieving, who fight against the purposes of God]. 
EPH.2.3	Among these [unbelievers] we all once lived in the passions of our flesh [our behavior governed by the sinful self], indulging the desires of 
EPH.2.4	But God, being [so very] rich in mercy, because of His great 
EPH.2.5	even when we were [spiritually] dead 
EPH.2.6	And He raised us up together with Him [when we believed], and seated us with Him in the heavenly 
EPH.2.7	[and He did this] so that in the ages to come He might [clearly] show the immeasurable 
EPH.2.8	For it is by grace [God’s remarkable compassion and favor drawing you to Christ] that you have been saved [actually delivered from judgment and given eternal life] through faith. And this [salvation] is not of yourselves [not through your own effort], but it is the [undeserved, gracious] gift of God; 
EPH.2.9	not as a result of [your] works [nor your attempts to keep the Law], so that no one will [be able to] boast 
EPH.2.10	For we are His workmanship [His own master work, a work of art], created in Christ Jesus [reborn from above—spiritually transformed, renewed, ready to be used] for good works, which God prepared [for us] beforehand [taking paths which He set], so that we would walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us].
EPH.2.11	Therefore, remember that at one time you Gentiles by birth, who are called “Uncircumcision” by those who called themselves “Circumcision,” [itself a mere mark] 
EPH.2.12	 that at that time you were separated from Christ [excluded from any relationship with Him], alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise [with no share in the sacred Messianic promise and without knowledge of God’s agreements], having no hope [in His promise] and [living] in the world without God. 
EPH.2.13	But now [at this very moment] in Christ Jesus you who once were [so very] far away [from God] have been brought near 
EPH.2.14	For He Himself is our peace 
EPH.2.15	by abolishing in His [own crucified] flesh the hostility 
EPH.2.16	And [that He] might reconcile them both [Jew and Gentile, united] in one body to God through the cross, thereby putting to death the hostility. 
EPH.2.17	A
EPH.2.18	For it is through Him that we both have a [direct] way of approach in one Spirit to the Father. 
EPH.2.19	So then you are no longer strangers and aliens [outsiders without rights of citizenship], but you are fellow citizens with the saints (God’s people), and are [members] of God’s household, 
EPH.2.20	having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the [chief] Cornerstone, 
EPH.2.21	in whom the whole structure is joined together, and it continues [to increase] growing into a holy temple in the Lord [a sanctuary dedicated, set apart, and sacred to the presence of the Lord]. 
EPH.2.22	In Him [and in fellowship with one another] you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.
EPH.3.1	For this reason [because I preach that you and believing Jews are joint heirs] I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles— 
EPH.3.2	assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace that was entrusted to me [to share with you] for your benefit; 
EPH.3.3	and that by [divine] revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I have already written in brief. 
EPH.3.4	By referring to this, when you read it you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, 
EPH.3.5	which in other generations was not disclosed to mankind, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets by the [Holy] Spirit; 
EPH.3.6	[it is this:] that the Gentiles are now joint heirs [with the Jews] and members of the same body, and joint partakers [sharing] in the [same divine] promise in Christ Jesus through [their faith in] the good news [of salvation]. 
EPH.3.7	Of this [gospel] I was made a minister by the gift of God’s grace given me through the working of His power. 
EPH.3.8	To me, [though I am] the very least of all the saints (God’s people), this grace [which is undeserved] was graciously given, to proclaim to the Gentiles the good news of the incomprehensible riches of Christ [that spiritual wealth which no one can fully understand], 
EPH.3.9	and to make plain [to everyone] the plan of the mystery [regarding the uniting of believing Jews and Gentiles into one body] which [until now] was kept hidden through the ages in [the mind of] God who created all things. 
EPH.3.10	So now through the church the multifaceted wisdom of God [in all its countless aspects] might now be made known [revealing the mystery] to the [angelic] rulers and authorities in the heavenly 
EPH.3.11	 in accordance with [the terms of] the eternal purpose which He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord, 
EPH.3.12	in whom we have boldness and confident access through faith in Him [that is, our faith gives us sufficient courage to freely and openly approach God through Christ]. 
EPH.3.13	So I ask you not to lose heart at my sufferings on your behalf, for they are your glory 
EPH.3.14	For this reason [grasping the greatness of this plan by which Jews and Gentiles are joined together in Christ] I bow my knees [in reverence] before the Father [of our Lord Jesus Christ], 
EPH.3.15	from whom every family in heaven and on earth 
EPH.3.16	May He grant you out of the riches of His glory, to be strengthened 
EPH.3.17	so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through your faith. And may you, having been [deeply] rooted and [securely] grounded in love, 
EPH.3.18	be fully capable of comprehending with all the saints (God’s people) the width and length and height and depth of His love [fully experiencing that amazing, endless love]; 
EPH.3.19	and [that you may come] to know [practically, through personal experience] the love of Christ which far surpasses [mere] knowledge [without experience], that you may be filled up [throughout your being] to all the fullness of God [so that you may have the richest experience of God’s presence in your lives, completely filled and flooded with God Himself].
EPH.3.20	Now to Him who is able to [carry out His purpose and] do superabundantly more than all that we dare ask or think [infinitely beyond our greatest prayers, hopes, or dreams], according to His power that is at work within us, 
EPH.3.21	to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations forever and ever. Amen.
EPH.4.1	So I, the prisoner for the Lord, appeal to you to live a life worthy of the calling to which you have been called [that is, to live a life that exhibits godly character, moral courage, personal integrity, and mature behavior—a life that expresses gratitude to God for your salvation], 
EPH.4.2	with all humility [forsaking self-righteousness], and gentleness [maintaining self-control], with patience, bearing with one another 
EPH.4.3	Make every effort to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the bond of peace [each individual working together to make the whole successful]. 
EPH.4.4	 one body [of believers] and one Spirit—just as you were called to one hope when called [to salvation]— 
EPH.4.5	one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 
EPH.4.6	one God and Father of us all who is [sovereign] over all and [working] through all and [living] in all.
EPH.4.7	Yet grace [God’s undeserved favor] was given to each one of us [not indiscriminately, but in different ways] in proportion to the measure of Christ’s [rich and abundant] gift. 
EPH.4.8	Therefore it says,
EPH.4.8	“W
EPH.4.8	H
EPH.4.8	A
EPH.4.9	(Now this 
EPH.4.10	He who descended is the 
EPH.4.11	And [His gifts to the church were varied and] He Himself appointed some as apostles [special messengers, representatives], some as prophets [who speak a new message from God to the people], some as evangelists [who spread the good news of salvation], and some as pastors and teachers [to shepherd and guide and instruct], 
EPH.4.12	[and He did this] to fully equip 
EPH.4.13	until we all reach oneness in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God, [growing spiritually] to become a mature believer, reaching to the measure of the fullness of Christ [manifesting His spiritual completeness and exercising our spiritual gifts in unity]. 
EPH.4.14	So that we are no longer children [spiritually immature], tossed back and forth [like ships on a stormy sea] and carried about by every wind of [shifting] doctrine, by the cunning 
EPH.4.15	But speaking the truth in love [in all things—both our speech and our lives expressing His truth], let us grow up in all 
EPH.4.16	From Him the whole body [the church, in all its various parts], joined and knitted 
EPH.4.17	So this I say, and solemnly affirm together with the Lord [as in His presence], that you must no longer live as the [unbelieving] Gentiles live, in the futility of their minds [and in the foolishness and emptiness of their souls], 
EPH.4.18	for their [moral] understanding is darkened 
EPH.4.19	And they, [the ungodly in their spiritual apathy], having become callous 
EPH.4.20	But you did not learn Christ in this way! 
EPH.4.21	If in fact you have [really] heard Him and have been taught by Him, just as truth is in Jesus [revealed in His life and personified in Him], 
EPH.4.22	that, regarding your previous way of life, you put off your old self [completely discard your former nature], which is being corrupted through deceitful desires, 
EPH.4.23	and be 
EPH.4.24	and put on the new self [the regenerated and renewed nature], created in God’s image, [godlike] in the righteousness and holiness of the truth [living in a way that expresses to God your gratitude for your salvation].
EPH.4.25	Therefore, rejecting all falsehood [whether lying, defrauding, telling half-truths, spreading rumors, any such as these], 
EPH.4.26	B
EPH.4.27	And do not give the devil an opportunity [to lead you into sin by holding a grudge, or nurturing anger, or harboring resentment, or cultivating bitterness]. 
EPH.4.28	The thief [who has become a believer] must no longer steal, but instead he must work hard [making an honest living], producing that which is good with his own hands, so that he will have 
EPH.4.29	Do not let unwholesome [foul, profane, worthless, vulgar] words ever come out of your mouth, but only such 
EPH.4.30	And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God [but seek to please Him], by whom you were sealed 
EPH.4.31	Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor [perpetual animosity, resentment, strife, fault-finding] and slander be put away from you, along with every kind of malice [all spitefulness, verbal abuse, malevolence]. 
EPH.4.32	Be kind 
EPH.5.1	Therefore become imitators of God [copy Him and follow His example], as well-beloved children [imitate their father]; 
EPH.5.2	and walk 
EPH.5.3	But sexual immorality and all [moral] impurity [indecent, offensive behavior] or greed must not even be hinted at among you, as is proper among saints [for as believers our way of life, whether in public or in private, reflects the validity of our faith]. 
EPH.5.4	Let there be no filthiness and silly talk, or coarse [obscene or vulgar] joking, 
EPH.5.5	For be sure of this: no immoral, impure, or greedy person—for that one is [in effect] an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God [for such a person places a higher value on something other than God].
EPH.5.6	Let no one deceive you with empty arguments [that encourage you to sin], for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience [those who habitually sin]. 
EPH.5.7	So do not participate 
EPH.5.8	For once you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of Light [live as those who are native-born to the Light] 
EPH.5.9	(for the fruit [the effect, the result] of the Light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth), 
EPH.5.10	trying to learn [by experience] what is pleasing to the Lord [and letting your lifestyles be examples of what is most acceptable to Him—your behavior expressing gratitude to God for your salvation]. 
EPH.5.11	Do not participate in the worthless 
EPH.5.12	for it is disgraceful even to mention the things that such people practice in secret. 
EPH.5.13	But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light [of God’s precepts], for 
EPH.5.14	For this reason He says,
EPH.5.14	“Awake, sleeper,
EPH.5.14	And arise from the dead,
EPH.5.14	And Christ will shine [as dawn] upon you 
EPH.5.15	Therefore see that you walk carefully [living life with honor, purpose, and courage; shunning those who tolerate and enable evil], not as the unwise, but as wise [sensible, intelligent, discerning people], 
EPH.5.16	making the very most of your time [on earth, recognizing and taking advantage of each opportunity and using it with wisdom and diligence], because the days are [filled with] evil. 
EPH.5.17	Therefore do not be foolish 
EPH.5.18	Do not get drunk with wine, for that is wickedness (corruption, stupidity), but be filled with the [Holy] Spirit 
EPH.5.19	Speak to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, [offering praise by] singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord; 
EPH.5.20	always giving thanks to God the Father for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; 
EPH.5.21	being subject to one another out of reverence for Christ.
EPH.5.22	Wives, be 
EPH.5.23	For the husband is head of the wife, as Christ is head of the church, Himself 
EPH.5.24	But as the church is subject to Christ, so also wives should be subject to their husbands in everything [respecting both their position as protector and their responsibility to God as head of the house].
EPH.5.25	Husbands, love your wives [seek the highest good for her and surround her with a caring, unselfish love], just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her, 
EPH.5.26	so that He might sanctify the church, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word [of God], 
EPH.5.27	so that [in turn] He might present the church to Himself in glorious splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy [set apart for God] and blameless. 
EPH.5.28	Even so husbands should 
EPH.5.29	For no one ever hated his own body, but [instead] he nourishes 
EPH.5.30	because we are members (parts) of His body. 
EPH.5.31	F
EPH.5.32	This mystery [of two becoming one] is great; but I am speaking with reference to [the relationship of] Christ and the church. 
EPH.5.33	However, each man among you [without exception] is to love his wife as his very own self [with behavior worthy of respect and esteem, always seeking the best for her with an attitude of lovingkindness], and the wife [must see to it] that she respects 
EPH.6.1	Children, obey your parents in the Lord [that is, accept their guidance and discipline as His representatives], for this is right [for obedience teaches wisdom and self-discipline]. 
EPH.6.2	H
EPH.6.3	, 
EPH.6.4	Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger [do not exasperate them to the point of resentment with demands that are trivial or unreasonable or humiliating or abusive; nor by showing favoritism or indifference to any of them], but bring them up [tenderly, with lovingkindness] in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
EPH.6.6	not in the way of eye-service [working only when someone is watching you and only] to please men, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart; 
EPH.6.7	rendering service with goodwill, as to the Lord, and not [only] to men, 
EPH.6.8	knowing that whatever good thing each one does, he will receive this back from the Lord, whether [he is] slave or free.
EPH.6.9	You masters, do the same [showing goodwill] toward them, and give up threatening 
EPH.6.10	In conclusion, be strong in the Lord [draw your strength from Him and be empowered through your union with Him] and in the power of His [boundless] might. 
EPH.6.11	Put on the full armor of God [for His precepts are like the splendid armor of a heavily-armed soldier], so that you may be able to [successfully] stand up against all the schemes 
EPH.6.12	For our struggle is not against flesh and blood [contending only with physical opponents], but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this [present] darkness, against the spiritual 
EPH.6.13	Therefore, put on the complete armor of God, so that you will be able to [successfully] resist 
EPH.6.14	So stand firm 
EPH.6.15	and having 
EPH.6.16	Above all, lift up the [protective] 
EPH.6.17	And take 
EPH.6.18	With all prayer and petition pray [with specific requests] at all times [on every occasion and in every season] in the Spirit, and with this in view, stay alert with all perseverance and petition [interceding in prayer] for all 
EPH.6.19	And 
EPH.6.20	for which I am an ambassador in chains. And 
EPH.6.21	Now, so that you may know how I am and what I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will tell you everything. 
EPH.6.22	I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know how we are, and that he may comfort 
EPH.6.23	Peace be to the 
EPH.6.24	Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with undying 
PHP.1.1	Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus (the Messiah, the Anointed),
PHP.1.2	Grace to you and peace [inner calm and spiritual well-being] from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
PHP.1.3	I thank my God in every remembrance of you, 
PHP.1.4	always offering every prayer of mine with joy [and with specific requests] for all of you, 
PHP.1.5	[thanking God] for your participation 
PHP.1.6	I am convinced 
PHP.1.7	It is right for me to feel this way about you, because [you have me in your heart as] I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the good news [regarding salvation], all of you share in [His matchless] grace with me. 
PHP.1.8	For God is my witness, how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus [whose great love fills me]. 
PHP.1.9	And this I pray, that your love may abound more and more [displaying itself in greater depth] in real knowledge and in practical insight, 
PHP.1.10	so that you may learn to recognize 
PHP.1.11	filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God [so that His glory may be both revealed and recognized].
PHP.1.12	Now I want you to know, 
PHP.1.13	My imprisonment in [the cause of] Christ has become common knowledge throughout the whole 
PHP.1.14	Because of my chains [seeing that I am doing well and that God is accomplishing great things], most of the 
PHP.1.15	Some, it is true, are [actually] preaching Christ out of envy and rivalry [toward me—for no better reason than a competitive spirit or misguided ambition], but others out of goodwill 
PHP.1.16	The latter [preach Christ] out of love, because they know that I have been put here [by God on purpose] for the defense of the gospel; 
PHP.1.17	but the former preach Christ [insincerely] out of selfish ambition [just self-promotion], thinking that they are causing me distress in my imprisonment. 
PHP.1.18	What then [does it matter]? So long as in every way, whether in pretense [for self-promotion] or in all honesty [to spread the truth], Christ is being preached; and in this I rejoice.
PHP.1.19	for I know [with confidence] that this will turn out for my deliverance 
PHP.1.20	It is my own eager expectation and hope, that [looking toward the future] I will not disgrace myself 
PHP.1.21	For to me, to live is Christ [He is my source of joy, my reason to live] and to die is gain [for I will be with Him in eternity]. 
PHP.1.22	If, however, it is to be life here 
PHP.1.23	But I am hard-pressed between the two. I have the desire to leave [this world] and be with Christ, for that is far, far better; 
PHP.1.24	yet to remain in my body is more necessary 
PHP.1.25	Since I am convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith, 
PHP.1.26	so that your rejoicing for me may overflow in Christ Jesus through my coming to you again.
PHP.1.27	Only [be sure to] lead your lives in a manner [that will be] worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I do come and see you or remain absent, I will hear about you that you are standing firm in one spirit [and one purpose], with one 
PHP.1.28	And in no way be alarmed 
PHP.1.29	For you have been granted [the privilege] for Christ’s sake, not only to believe 
PHP.1.30	[and so you are] experiencing the same [kind of] conflict which 
PHP.2.1	Therefore if there is any encouragement 
PHP.2.2	make my joy complete by being of the same mind, having the same 
PHP.2.3	Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit [through factional motives, or strife], but with [an attitude of] humility [being neither arrogant nor self-righteous], regard others as more important than yourselves. 
PHP.2.4	Do not 
PHP.2.5	Have this same attitude in yourselves which was in Christ Jesus [look to Him as your example in selfless humility], 
PHP.2.6	who, although He existed in the form 
PHP.2.7	but emptied Himself [without renouncing or diminishing His deity, but only temporarily giving up the outward expression of divine equality and His rightful dignity] by assuming the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men [He became completely human but was without sin, being fully God and fully man]. 
PHP.2.8	After He was found in [terms of His] outward appearance as a man [for a divinely-appointed time], He humbled Himself [still further] by becoming obedient [to the Father] to the point of death, even death on a cross. 
PHP.2.9	For this reason also [because He obeyed and so completely humbled Himself], God has highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, 
PHP.2.10	so that at the name of Jesus 
PHP.2.11	and that every tongue will confess 
PHP.2.12	So then, my dear ones, just as you have always obeyed [my instructions with enthusiasm], not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, continue to work out your salvation [that is, cultivate it, bring it to full effect, actively pursue spiritual maturity] with awe-inspired fear and trembling [using serious caution and critical self-evaluation to avoid anything that might offend God or discredit the name of Christ]. 
PHP.2.13	For it is [not your strength, but it is] 
PHP.2.14	Do everything without murmuring or questioning [the providence of God], 
PHP.2.15	so that you may prove yourselves to be blameless 
PHP.2.16	holding out 
PHP.2.17	But even if I am being poured out as a 
PHP.2.18	You too, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me.
PHP.2.19	But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I may also be encouraged by learning news about you. 
PHP.2.20	For I have no one else [like him who is] so kindred a spirit who will be genuinely concerned for your [spiritual] welfare. 
PHP.2.21	For the others [who deserted me after my arrest] all seek [to advance] their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. 
PHP.2.22	But you know of Timothy’s tested worth 
PHP.2.23	Therefore, I hope [that it is His will] to send him immediately, just as soon as I see how 
PHP.2.24	and I trust [confidently] in the Lord that soon I also will be coming 
PHP.2.25	However, I thought it necessary to send 
PHP.2.26	For he has been longing 
PHP.2.27	He certainly was sick and close to death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow. 
PHP.2.28	So I have sent him all the more eagerly so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may be less concerned 
PHP.2.29	Welcome him 
PHP.2.30	because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was lacking in your service to me [which distance prevented you from rendering personally].
PHP.3.1	Finally, my 
PHP.3.2	Look out for the 
PHP.3.3	for we [who are born-again have been reborn from above—spiritually transformed, renewed, set apart for His purpose and] are the 
PHP.3.4	though I myself might have [some grounds for] confidence in the flesh [if I were pursuing salvation by works]. If anyone else thinks that he has reason to be confident in the flesh [that is, in his own efforts to achieve salvation], I 
PHP.3.5	circumcised when I was eight days old, of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews [an exemplary Hebrew]; as to the [observance of the] Law, a Pharisee; 
PHP.3.6	as to my zeal [for Jewish tradition], a persecutor of the church; and as to righteousness [supposed right living] which [my fellow Jews believe] is in the Law, I proved myself blameless.
PHP.3.7	But whatever 
PHP.3.8	But more than that, I count everything as loss compared to the priceless privilege 
PHP.3.9	and may be found in Him [believing and relying on Him], not having any righteousness of my own derived from [my obedience to] the Law 
PHP.3.10	 that I may know Him [experientially, becoming more thoroughly acquainted with Him, understanding the remarkable wonders of His Person more completely] and [in that same way experience] the power of His resurrection [which overflows and is active in believers], and [that I may share] the fellowship of His sufferings, by being 
PHP.3.11	so that I may attain to the resurrection [that will raise me] from the dead.
PHP.3.12	Not that I have already obtained it [this goal of being Christlike] or have already been made perfect, but I actively press on 
PHP.3.13	Brothers and sisters, I do not consider that I have made it my own yet; but one thing 
PHP.3.14	I press on toward the goal to win the [heavenly] prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. 
PHP.3.15	All of us who are mature [pursuing spiritual perfection] should have this attitude. And if in any respect you have a different attitude, that too God will make clear to you. 
PHP.3.16	Only let us stay true to what we have already attained.
PHP.3.17	Brothers and sisters, together follow my example and observe those who live by the pattern we gave you. 
PHP.3.18	For there are many, of whom I have often told you, and now tell you even with tears, who live as enemies of the cross of Christ [rejecting and opposing His way of salvation], 
PHP.3.19	whose fate is destruction, whose god is 
PHP.3.20	But [we are different, because] our citizenship is in heaven. And from there we eagerly await [the coming of] the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ; 
PHP.3.21	who, by exerting that power which enables Him even to subject everything to Himself, will [not only] transform [but completely refashion] our 
PHP.4.1	Therefore, my 
PHP.4.2	I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to agree 
PHP.4.3	Indeed, I ask you too, my true companion, to help these women [to keep on cooperating], for they have shared my struggle in the [cause of the] gospel, together with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life.
PHP.4.4	Rejoice in the Lord always [delight, take pleasure in Him]; again I will say, rejoice! 
PHP.4.5	Let your gentle 
PHP.4.6	Do not be anxious 
PHP.4.7	And the peace of God [that peace which reassures the heart, that peace] which transcends all understanding, [that peace which] stands guard over your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus [is yours].
PHP.4.8	Finally, 
PHP.4.9	The things which you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things [in daily life], and the God [who is the source] of peace 
PHP.4.10	I rejoiced greatly in the Lord, that now at last you have renewed your concern for me; indeed, you were concerned about me 
PHP.4.11	Not that I speak from [any personal] need, for I have learned to be content [and self-sufficient through Christ, satisfied to the point where I am not disturbed or uneasy] regardless of my circumstances. 
PHP.4.12	I know how to get along and live humbly [in difficult times], and I also know how to enjoy abundance 
PHP.4.13	I can do all things [which He has called me to do] through Him who strengthens 
PHP.4.14	Nevertheless, it was right of you to share [with me] in my difficulties.
PHP.4.15	And you Philippians know that in the early days of preaching the gospel, after I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of 
PHP.4.16	for even in Thessalonica you sent 
PHP.4.17	Not that I seek the gift itself, but I do seek the profit which increases to your [heavenly] account [the blessing which is accumulating for you]. 
PHP.4.18	But I have received everything in full and more; I am amply supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent me. They are the fragrant aroma of an offering, an acceptable sacrifice which God welcomes 
PHP.4.19	And my God will liberally supply (fill until full) your every need according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus. 
PHP.4.20	To our God and Father be the glory 
PHP.4.21	Remember me to every 
PHP.4.22	All 
PHP.4.23	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
COL.1.1	Paul, an apostle (special messenger, personally chosen representative) of Christ Jesus (the Messiah, the Anointed) by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
COL.1.2	To the 
COL.1.3	We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, as we pray always for you, 
COL.1.4	for we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus [how you lean on Him with absolute confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness], and of the [unselfish] 
COL.1.5	because of the [confident] hope [of experiencing that] which is reserved 
COL.1.6	which has come to you. Indeed, just as in the whole world 
COL.1.7	You learned it from [our representative] Epaphras, our beloved fellow bond-servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf 
COL.1.8	and he also has told us of your love [well-grounded and nurtured] in the [Holy] Spirit.
COL.1.9	For this reason, since the day we heard about it, we have not stopped praying for you, asking [specifically] that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom [with insight into His purposes], and in understanding [of spiritual things], 
COL.1.10	so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord [displaying admirable character, moral courage, and personal integrity], to [fully] please 
COL.1.11	[we pray that you may be] strengthened 
COL.1.12	giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints (God’s people) in the Light.
COL.1.13	For He has rescued us 
COL.1.14	in whom we have redemption [because of His sacrifice, resulting in] the forgiveness of our sins [and the cancellation of sins’ penalty].
COL.1.15	He is the exact living image [the essential manifestation] of the unseen God [the visible representation of the invisible], the firstborn [the preeminent one, the sovereign, and the originator] of all creation. 
COL.1.16	For 
COL.1.17	And He Himself existed 
COL.1.18	He is also the head [the life-source and leader] of the body, the 
COL.1.19	For it pleased the 
COL.1.20	and through [the intervention of] the Son to reconcile all things to Himself, making peace [with believers] through the blood of His cross; through Him, [I say,] whether things on earth or things in heaven.
COL.1.21	And although you were at one time estranged 
COL.1.22	yet Christ has now reconciled you [to God] in His 
COL.1.23	[and He will do this] if you continue in the faith, well-grounded and steadfast, and not shifting away from the [confident] hope [that is a result] of the gospel that you have heard, which was proclaimed 
COL.1.24	Now I rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf. And with my own body I 
COL.1.25	In 
COL.1.27	God [in His eternal plan] chose to make known to them how great for the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in 
COL.1.28	We proclaim Him, warning and instructing everyone in all wisdom [that is, with comprehensive insight into the word and purposes of God], so that we may present every person complete in Christ [mature, fully trained, and perfect in Him—the Anointed]. 
COL.1.29	For this I labor [often to the point of exhaustion], striving with His power 
COL.2.1	For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you and for those [believers] at 
COL.2.2	[For my hope is] that their hearts may be encouraged as they are knit together in [unselfish] 
COL.2.3	in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge [regarding the word and purposes of God]. 
COL.2.4	I say this so that no one will deceive you with persuasive [but thoroughly deceptive] arguments. 
COL.2.5	For even though I am absent [from you] in body, nevertheless I am with you in spirit, 
COL.2.6	Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in [union with] Him [reflecting His character in the things you do and say—living lives that lead others away from sin], 
COL.2.7	having been deeply rooted [in Him] and 
COL.2.8	See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception [pseudo-intellectual babble], according to the tradition [and musings] of 
COL.2.9	For in Him all the fullness of Deity (the Godhead) dwells in bodily form [completely expressing the divine essence of God]. 
COL.2.10	And in Him you have been made complete [achieving spiritual stature through Christ], and He is the head over all rule and authority [of every angelic and earthly power]. 
COL.2.11	In Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, but by the [spiritual] circumcision of Christ in the stripping off of the body of the flesh [the sinful carnal nature], 
COL.2.12	having been buried with Him in baptism and raised with Him [to a new life] through [your] faith in the working of God, [as displayed] when He raised Christ from the dead. 
COL.2.13	When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh (worldliness, manner of life), God made you alive together with Christ, having [freely] forgiven us all our sins, 
COL.2.14	having canceled out the 
COL.2.15	When He had disarmed the rulers and authorities [those supernatural forces of evil operating against us], He made a public example of them [exhibiting them as captives in His triumphal procession], having triumphed over them through 
COL.2.16	Therefore let no one judge you in regard to food and drink or in regard to [the observance of] a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day. 
COL.2.17	Such things are only a shadow of what is to come 
COL.2.18	Let no one defraud you of your prize [your freedom in Christ and your salvation] by insisting on mock humility and the worship of angels, going into detail about 
COL.2.19	and not holding fast to the head [of the body, Jesus Christ], from whom the entire body, supplied and knit together by its joints and ligaments, grows with the growth [that can come only] from God.
COL.2.20	If you have died with Christ to the 
COL.2.21	“Do not handle [this], do not taste [that], do not [even] touch!”? 
COL.2.22	(these things all perish with use)—in accordance with the commandments and teachings of men. 
COL.2.23	These practices indeed have the appearance [that popularly passes as that] of wisdom in self-made religion and mock humility and severe treatment of the body (asceticism), but are of no value against sinful indulgence [because they do not honor God].
COL.3.1	Therefore if you have been raised with Christ [to a new life, sharing in His resurrection from the dead], keep seeking the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. 
COL.3.2	Set your mind 
COL.3.3	For you died [to this world], and your [new, real] life is hidden with Christ in God. 
COL.3.4	When Christ, who is our life, 
COL.3.5	So put to death 
COL.3.6	Because of these [sinful] things the [divine] wrath of God is coming 
COL.3.7	and in these [sinful things] you also once walked, when you were 
COL.3.8	But now rid yourselves [completely] of all these things: anger, rage, malice, slander, and obscene (abusive, filthy, vulgar) language from your mouth. 
COL.3.9	Do not lie to one another, for you have stripped off the old self with its 
COL.3.10	and have put on the new [spiritual] self who is being 
COL.3.11	 in which there is no [distinction between] Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, [nor between nations whether] 
COL.3.12	So, as God’s own chosen people, who are holy [set apart, sanctified for His purpose] and well-beloved [by God Himself], put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience [which has the power to endure whatever injustice or unpleasantness comes, with good temper]; 
COL.3.13	bearing graciously with one another, and willingly forgiving each other if one has a cause for complaint against another; just as the Lord has forgiven you, so should you forgive. 
COL.3.14	Beyond all these things put on 
COL.3.15	Let the peace of Christ [the inner calm of one who walks daily with Him] be the controlling factor in your hearts [deciding and settling questions that arise]. To this 
COL.3.16	Let the [spoken] word of Christ have its home within you [dwelling in your heart and mind—permeating every aspect of your being] as you teach [spiritual things] and admonish 
COL.3.17	Whatever you do [no matter what it is] in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus [and in dependence on Him], giving thanks to God the Father through Him.
COL.3.18	Wives, be 
COL.3.19	Husbands, love your wives [with an affectionate, sympathetic, selfless love that always seeks the best for them] and do not be embittered 
COL.3.20	Children, obey your parents [as God’s representatives] in all things, for this [attitude of respect and obedience] is well-pleasing 
COL.3.21	Fathers, do not provoke 
COL.3.22	Servants, in everything obey those who are your masters on earth, not only with external service, as those who merely please people, but with sincerity of heart because of your fear of the Lord. 
COL.3.23	Whatever you do [whatever your task may be], work from the soul [that is, put in your very best effort], as [something done] for the Lord and not for men, 
COL.3.24	knowing [with all certainty] that it is from the Lord [not from men] that you will receive the inheritance which is your [greatest] reward. It is the Lord Christ whom you [actually] serve. 
COL.3.25	For he who does wrong will be punished for his wrongdoing, and [with God] there is no partiality [no special treatment based on a person’s position in life].
COL.4.1	Masters, [on your part] deal with your slaves justly and fairly, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.
COL.4.2	Be persistent 
COL.4.3	At the same time pray for us, too, that God will open a door [of opportunity] to us for the word, to proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I have been imprisoned; 
COL.4.4	that I may make it clear [and speak boldly and unfold the mystery] in the way I should.
COL.4.5	Conduct yourself with wisdom in your interactions with outsiders (non-believers), make the most of each opportunity [treating it as something precious]. 
COL.4.6	Let your speech at all times be gracious 
COL.4.7	As to all my affairs, 
COL.4.8	I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are doing and that he may encourage your hearts; 
COL.4.9	and with him is 
COL.4.10	Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, wishes to be remembered to you; as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (about whom you received instructions; if he comes to you, welcome him); 
COL.4.11	and from Jesus, who is called Justus. These are the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are from the circumcision (Jewish Christians), and they have proved to be an encouragement 
COL.4.12	Epaphras, who is one of you and a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, sends you greetings. [He is] always striving for you in his prayers, praying with genuine concern, [pleading] that you may [as people of character and courage] stand firm, [spiritually mature] and fully assured in all the will of God. 
COL.4.13	For I testify for him that he has worked strenuously for you and for the believers in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis. 
COL.4.14	Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas greet you. 
COL.4.15	Give my greetings to the 
COL.4.16	When this letter has been read among you, see that it is read in the church of the Laodiceans; and also that you in turn read 
COL.4.17	And say to Archippus, “See to it that you fulfill [carefully the duties of] the ministry which you have received in the Lord.”
COL.4.18	I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my chains. May grace (God’s unmerited favor and blessing) be with you.
1TH.1.1	Paul, Silvanus (Silas), and Timothy,
1TH.1.2	We give thanks to God always for all of you, 
1TH.1.3	recalling unceasingly before our God and Father your work energized by faith, and your service motivated by love and unwavering hope in [the return of] our Lord Jesus Christ. 
1TH.1.4	Brothers and sisters beloved by God, we know that He has chosen you; 
1TH.1.5	for our good news [regarding salvation] came to you not only in word, but also in [its inherent] power and in the Holy Spirit and with great conviction [on our part]. You know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your benefit. 
1TH.1.6	You became imitators of us and [through us] of the Lord, after you welcomed our message in [a time of] great trouble with the joy supplied by the Holy Spirit; 
1TH.1.7	so that you became an example to all the believers in 
1TH.1.8	For the word of the Lord has resounded from you 
1TH.1.9	For they themselves report about us, 
1TH.1.10	and to [look forward and confidently] wait for [the coming of] His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead—Jesus, who [personally] rescues us from the coming wrath [and draws us to Himself, granting us all the privileges and rewards of a new life with Him].
1TH.2.1	For you know, brothers and sisters, that our coming to you has not been ineffective (fruitless, in vain), 
1TH.2.2	but after we had already suffered and been outrageously treated in Philippi, as you know, yet in [the strength of] our God we summoned the courage to proclaim boldly to you the good news of God [regarding salvation] amid great opposition. 
1TH.2.3	For our appeal does not 
1TH.2.4	But just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel [that tells the good news of salvation through faith in Christ], so we speak, not as [if we were trying] to please people [to gain power and popularity], but 
1TH.2.5	For as you well know, we never came with words of flattery nor with a pretext for greed—God is our witness— 
1TH.2.6	nor did we seek glory 
1TH.2.7	But we behaved gently when we were among you, like a devoted 
1TH.2.8	Having such a deep affection for you, we 
1TH.2.9	For you remember, 
1TH.2.10	You are witnesses, and so is God, how unworldly and just and blameless was our behavior toward you who believe [in our Lord Jesus Christ]. 
1TH.2.11	For you know how we were exhorting and encouraging and imploring each one of you just as a father does [in dealing with] his own children, [guiding you] 
1TH.2.12	to live lives [of honor, moral courage, and personal integrity] worthy of the God who [saves you and] calls you into His own kingdom and glory.
1TH.2.13	And we also thank God continually for this, that when you received the word of God [concerning salvation] which you heard from us, you welcomed it not as the word of [mere] men, but as it truly is, the word of God, which is effectually at work in you who believe [exercising its inherent, supernatural power in those of faith]. 
1TH.2.14	For you, 
1TH.2.15	who 
1TH.2.16	forbidding us from speaking to the Gentiles (non-Jews) so that they may be saved. So, as always, they fill up [to the brim] the measure of their sins [allotted to them by God]. But [God’s] wrath has come upon them at last [completely and forever].
1TH.2.17	But since we were taken away from you, believers, for a little while—in person, but not in heart—we endeavored, with great longing to see you face to face. 
1TH.2.18	For we wanted to come to you—I, Paul, again and again [wanted to come], but Satan hindered us. 
1TH.2.19	For who is [the object of] our hope or joy or our victor’s wreath of triumphant celebration [when we stand] in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming? Is it not you? 
1TH.2.20	For you are [indeed] our glory and our joy!
1TH.3.1	Therefore, when we could no longer endure our separation [from you], we thought it best to be left behind, alone at Athens, 
1TH.3.2	and so we sent Timothy, our brother and God’s servant in [spreading] the good news of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you [exhorting, comforting, and establishing you] in regard to your faith, 
1TH.3.3	so that no one would be unsettled by these difficulties [to which I have referred]. For you know that we have been destined for this [as something unavoidable in our position]. 
1TH.3.4	For even when we were with you, we warned you plainly in advance that we were going to experience persecution; and so, as you know, it has come to pass. 
1TH.3.5	For this reason, when I could no longer endure the suspense, I sent 
1TH.3.6	But now that Timothy has come back to us from [his visit with] you, and has brought us good news of your [steadfast] faith and [the warmth of your] love, and [reported] that you always think kindly of us 
1TH.3.7	for this reason, brothers and sisters, during all our distress and suffering we have been comforted 
1TH.3.8	because now we 
1TH.3.9	For what [adequate] thanks can we offer to God for you in return for all the joy 
1TH.3.10	We continue to pray night and day most earnestly that we may see you face to face, and may complete whatever may be imperfect 
1TH.3.11	Now may our God and Father Himself, and Jesus our Lord guide our steps to you [by removing the obstacles that stand in our way]. 
1TH.3.12	And may the Lord cause you to increase and excel 
1TH.3.13	so that He may strengthen 
1TH.4.1	Finally, believers, we ask and admonish you in the Lord Jesus, that you follow the 
1TH.4.2	For you know what commandments 
1TH.4.3	For this is the will of God, that you be sanctified [separated and set apart from sin]: that you abstain 
1TH.4.4	that each of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor [being available for God’s purpose and separated from things profane], 
1TH.4.5	not [to be used] in lustful passion, like the Gentiles who do not know God 
1TH.4.6	and that [in this matter of sexual misconduct] no man 
1TH.4.7	For God has not called us to impurity, but to holiness [to be dedicated, and set apart by behavior that pleases Him, whether in public or in private]. 
1TH.4.8	So whoever rejects 
1TH.4.9	Now concerning brotherly love, you have no need for 
1TH.4.10	For indeed you already do practice it toward all the 
1TH.4.11	and to make it your ambition to live quietly 
1TH.4.12	so that you will behave properly toward outsiders [exhibiting good character, personal integrity, and moral courage worthy of the respect of the outside world], and be dependent on no one 
1TH.4.13	Now we do not want you to be uninformed, believers, about those who are asleep [in death], so that you will not grieve [for them] as the others do who have no hope [beyond this present life]. 
1TH.4.14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again [as in fact He did], even so God [in this same way—by raising them from the dead] will bring with Him those [believers] who have fallen asleep in Jesus. 
1TH.4.15	For we say this to you by the Lord’s [own] word, that we who are still alive and remain until the coming of the Lord, will in no way precede [into His presence] those [believers] who have fallen asleep [in death]. 
1TH.4.16	For the Lord Himself will come down from heaven with a shout of command, with the voice of the 
1TH.4.17	Then we who are alive and remain [on the earth] will 
1TH.4.18	Therefore comfort 
1TH.5.1	Now as to the 
1TH.5.2	For you yourselves know perfectly well that the day of the [return of the] Lord is coming just as a thief [comes unexpectedly and suddenly] in the night. 
1TH.5.3	While they are saying, “Peace and safety [all is well and secure!]” then [in a moment unforeseen] destruction will come upon them suddenly like labor pains on a woman with child, and they will absolutely not escape [for there will be no way to escape the judgment of the Lord]. 
1TH.5.4	But you, 
1TH.5.5	for you are all sons of light and sons of day. We do not belong to the night nor to darkness. 
1TH.5.6	So then let us not sleep [in spiritual indifference] as the rest [of the world does], but let us keep wide awake [alert and cautious] and let us be sober [self-controlled, calm, and wise]. 
1TH.5.7	For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who are drunk get drunk at night. 
1TH.5.8	But since we [believers] belong to the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the hope 
1TH.5.9	For God has not destined us to [incur His] wrath [that is, He did not select us to condemn us], but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
1TH.5.10	who died [willingly] for us, so that whether we are awake (alive) or asleep (dead) [at Christ’s appearing], we will live together with Him [sharing eternal life]. 
1TH.5.11	Therefore encourage 
1TH.5.12	Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to appreciate those who diligently work among you [recognize, acknowledge, and respect your leaders], who are in charge over you in the Lord and who give you instruction, 
1TH.5.13	and [we ask that you appreciate them and] hold them in the highest esteem in love because of their work [on your behalf]. Live in peace with one another. 
1TH.5.14	We [earnestly] urge you, believers, admonish those who are out of line [the undisciplined, the unruly, the disorderly], encourage the timid [who lack spiritual courage], help the [spiritually] weak, be very patient with everyone [always controlling your temper]. 
1TH.5.15	See that no one repays another with evil for evil, but always seek that which is good for one another and for all people. 
1TH.5.16	Rejoice always 
1TH.5.17	be unceasing 
1TH.5.18	in every situation [no matter what the circumstances] be thankful 
1TH.5.19	Do not quench [subdue, or be unresponsive to the working and guidance of] the [Holy] Spirit. 
1TH.5.20	Do not scorn 
1TH.5.21	But test 
1TH.5.22	Abstain from every form of evil [withdraw and keep away from it].
1TH.5.23	Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you through and through [that is, separate you from profane and vulgar things, make you pure and whole and undamaged—consecrated to Him—set apart for His purpose]; and may your spirit and soul and body be kept complete and [be found] blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
1TH.5.24	Faithful 
1TH.5.25	Brothers and sisters, pray for us.
1TH.5.26	Greet all the believers with a holy 
1TH.5.27	I solemnly charge you by the Lord to have this letter read before all the 
1TH.5.28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
2TH.1.1	Paul, Silvanus (Silas), and Timothy,
2TH.1.2	Grace to you and peace [inner calm and spiritual well-being] from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.1.3	We ought always 
2TH.1.4	Therefore, we speak of you with pride among the churches of God for your steadfastness [your unflinching endurance, and patience] and your firm faith in the midst of all the persecution and [crushing] distress which you endure. 
2TH.1.5	 a positive proof of the righteous judgment of God [a sign of His fair verdict], so that you will be considered worthy of His kingdom, for which indeed you are suffering. 
2TH.1.6	For after all it is 
2TH.1.7	and to 
2TH.1.8	dealing out [full and complete] vengeance to those who do not [seek to] know God and to those who ignore 
2TH.1.9	These people will pay the penalty 
2TH.1.10	when He comes to be glorified in His saints on that day [that is, glorified through the changed lives of those who have accepted Him as Savior and have been set apart for His purpose], and to be marveled at among all who have believed, because our testimony to you was believed 
2TH.1.11	With this in view, we constantly pray for you, that our God will count you worthy of your calling [to faith] and with [His] power fulfill every desire for goodness, and complete [your] every work of faith, 
2TH.1.12	so that the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified in you [by what you do], and you in Him, according to the [precious] grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.2.1	Now in regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our 
2TH.2.2	not to be quickly unsettled or alarmed either by a [so-called prophetic revelation of a] spirit or a message or a letter [alleged to be] from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has [already] come. 
2TH.2.3	Let no one in any way deceive 
2TH.2.4	who opposes and exalts himself [so proudly and so insolently] above 
2TH.2.5	Do you not remember that when I was still with you, I was telling you these things? 
2TH.2.6	And you know what restrains him now [from being revealed]; it is so that he will be revealed at his own [appointed] time. 
2TH.2.7	For the mystery of lawlessness [rebellion against divine authority and the coming reign of lawlessness] is already at work; [but it is restrained] only until he who now restrains it is taken out of the way. 
2TH.2.8	Then the lawless one [the Antichrist] will be revealed and the Lord Jesus will slay him with the breath of His mouth and bring him to an end by the appearance of His coming. 
2TH.2.9	The coming of the [Antichrist, the lawless] one is through the activity of Satan, [attended] with great power [all kinds of counterfeit miracles] and [deceptive] signs and false wonders [all of them lies], 
2TH.2.10	and by unlimited seduction to evil 
2TH.2.11	Because of this God will send upon them a misleading influence, [an activity of error and deception] so they will believe the lie, 
2TH.2.12	in order that all may be judged 
2TH.2.13	But we should 
2TH.2.14	It was to this end that He called you through our gospel [the good news of Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection], so that you may obtain 
2TH.2.15	So then, 
2TH.2.16	Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who has loved us and given us everlasting comfort 
2TH.2.17	comfort 
2TH.3.1	Finally, brothers and sisters, pray 
2TH.3.2	and [pray] that we will be rescued from perverse and evil men; for not everyone has the faith. 
2TH.3.3	But the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen you [setting you on a firm foundation] and will protect 
2TH.3.4	We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you are doing and will 
2TH.3.5	May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the steadfastness 
2TH.3.6	Now we command you, believers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ 
2TH.3.7	For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example, because we did not act in an undisciplined 
2TH.3.8	nor did we eat anyone’s bread without paying for it, but with labor and hardship we worked night and day [to pay our own way] so that we would not be a 
2TH.3.9	not because we do not have a right 
2TH.3.10	For even while we were with you, we used to give you this order: if anyone is not willing to work, then he is 
2TH.3.11	Indeed, we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined 
2TH.3.12	Now such people we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down 
2TH.3.13	And as for [the rest of] you, 
2TH.3.14	Now if anyone [in the church] does not obey what we say in this letter, take special note of that person and do not associate with him, so that he will be ashamed 
2TH.3.15	Do not regard him as an enemy, but keep admonishing him as a [believing] brother.
2TH.3.16	Now may the Lord of peace Himself grant you His peace at all times 
2TH.3.17	I, Paul, write you this final greeting with my own hand. This is the distinguishing mark in every letter [of mine, that shows it is genuine]. It is the way I write [my handwriting and signature]. 
2TH.3.18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you.
1TI.1.1	Paul, an apostle (special messenger, personally chosen representative) of Christ Jesus by the commandment of God our Savior, and of Christ Jesus (the Messiah, the Anointed) our Hope [the fulfillment of our salvation],
1TI.1.2	to Timothy, my true son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace [inner calm and spiritual well-being] from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
1TI.1.3	As I urged you when I was on my way to Macedonia, stay on at Ephesus so that you may instruct certain individuals not to teach any different doctrines, 
1TI.1.4	nor to pay attention to legends (fables, myths) and endless genealogies, which give rise to useless speculation 
1TI.1.5	But the goal of our instruction is love [which springs] from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. 
1TI.1.6	Some individuals have wandered away from these things into empty arguments 
1TI.1.7	wanting to be teachers of the Law [of Moses], even though they do not understand the terms they use or the subjects about which they make [such] confident declarations.
1TI.1.8	Now we know [without any doubt] that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully 
1TI.1.9	understanding the fact that law is not enacted for the righteous person [the one in right standing with God], but for lawless and rebellious people, for the ungodly and sinful, for the irreverent and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers, 
1TI.1.10	for sexually immoral persons, for homosexuals, for 
1TI.1.11	according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.
1TI.1.12	I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has granted me [the needed] strength 
1TI.1.13	even though I was formerly a blasphemer [of our Lord] and a persecutor [of His church] and a shameful 
1TI.1.14	The grace of our Lord [His amazing, unmerited favor and blessing] flowed out in superabundance [for me, together] with the faith and love which are [realized] in Christ Jesus. 
1TI.1.15	This is a faithful 
1TI.1.16	Yet for this reason I found mercy, so that in me as the foremost [of sinners], Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience as an example 
1TI.1.17	Now to the King of the ages [eternal], immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
1TI.1.18	This command I entrust to you, Timothy, my son, in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you, so that [inspired and aided] by them you may fight the good fight [in contending with false teachers], 
1TI.1.19	keeping your faith [leaning completely on God with absolute trust and confidence in His guidance] and having a good conscience; for some [people] have rejected [their moral compass] and have made a shipwreck of their faith. 
1TI.1.20	Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have 
1TI.2.1	First of all, then, I urge that petitions (specific requests), prayers, intercessions (prayers for others) and thanksgivings be offered on behalf of all people, 
1TI.2.2	for 
1TI.2.3	This [kind of praying] is good and acceptable 
1TI.2.4	who 
1TI.2.5	For there is [only] one God, and [only] one Mediator between God and mankind, the Man Christ Jesus, 
1TI.2.6	who gave Himself as a ransom [a substitutionary sacrifice to atone] for all, the testimony given at the right 
1TI.2.7	And for this matter I was appointed a preacher and an apostle—I am telling the truth, I am not lying [when I say this]—a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
1TI.2.8	Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands, without anger and disputing 
1TI.2.9	Likewise, 
1TI.2.10	but instead 
1TI.2.11	A woman must quietly receive instruction with all submissiveness. 
1TI.2.12	I do not allow a woman to 
1TI.2.13	For Adam was formed first [by God from the earth], then Eve; 
1TI.2.14	and it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman who was led astray and 
1TI.2.15	But 
1TI.3.1	This is a faithful 
1TI.3.2	Now an overseer must be blameless 
1TI.3.3	not addicted to wine, not 
1TI.3.4	 manage his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity [keeping them respectful and well-behaved] 
1TI.3.5	(for if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?). 
1TI.3.6	and 
1TI.3.7	And he must have a good reputation 
1TI.3.9	but upholding 
1TI.3.10	These men must first be tested; then if they are found to be blameless 
1TI.3.11	Women must likewise be worthy of respect, not malicious gossips, but self-controlled, [thoroughly] trustworthy in all things. 
1TI.3.12	Deacons must be husbands of 
1TI.3.13	For those who have served well as deacons gain a high standing [having a good reputation among the congregation], and great confidence in the faith which is [founded on and centered] in Christ Jesus.
1TI.3.14	I hope to come to you before long, but I am writing these instructions to you 
1TI.3.15	in case I am delayed, so that you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth. 
1TI.3.16	And great, we confess, is the mystery [the hidden truth] of godliness:
1TI.3.16	He (Jesus Christ) who was revealed in human flesh,
1TI.3.16	Was justified 
1TI.3.16	Seen by angels,
1TI.3.16	Preached among the nations,
1TI.3.16	Believed on in the world,
1TI.3.16	Taken up in glory.
1TI.4.1	But the [Holy] Spirit explicitly 
1TI.4.2	[misled] by the hypocrisy of liars whose consciences are seared as with a branding iron [leaving them incapable of ethical functioning], 
1TI.4.3	who forbid marriage and 
1TI.4.4	For everything God has created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with gratitude; 
1TI.4.5	for it is sanctified [set apart, dedicated to God] by means of the word of God and prayer.
1TI.4.6	If you point out these instructions to the 
1TI.4.7	But have nothing to do with irreverent folklore 
1TI.4.8	For physical training is of some value, but godliness (spiritual training) is of value in everything 
1TI.4.9	This is a faithful 
1TI.4.10	It is for this that we labor and strive [often called to account], because we have fixed our [confident] hope on the living God, who is the 
1TI.4.11	Keep commanding and teaching these things. 
1TI.4.12	Let no one look down on [you because of] your youth, but be an example 
1TI.4.13	Until I come, devote yourself to public reading [of Scripture], to preaching and to teaching [the sound doctrine of God’s word]. 
1TI.4.14	Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you, [that special endowment] which was intentionally bestowed on you [by the Holy Spirit] through prophetic utterance when the 
1TI.4.15	Practice 
1TI.4.16	Pay close attention to yourself [concentrate on your personal development] and to your teaching; persevere in these things [hold to them], for as you do this you will ensure salvation both for yourself and for those who hear you.
1TI.5.1	Do not sharply reprimand an older man, but appeal to him as [you would to] a father, to younger men as brothers, 
1TI.5.2	to older women as mothers, to younger women as sisters, in all purity [being careful to maintain appropriate relationships].
1TI.5.3	Honor 
1TI.5.4	But if a widow has children or grandchildren [who are adults], see to it that these first learn to show great respect to their own family [as their religious duty and natural obligation], and to compensate their parents 
1TI.5.5	Now a woman who is really a widow and has been left [entirely] alone [without adequate income] trusts in God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day. 
1TI.5.6	Whereas she who lives for pleasure 
1TI.5.7	Keep instructing [the people to do] these things as well, so that they may be blameless 
1TI.5.8	If anyone fails to provide for his own, and especially for those of his own family, he has denied the faith [by disregarding its precepts] and is worse than an unbeliever [who fulfills his obligation in these matters].
1TI.5.9	A widow is to be put on the list [to receive regular assistance] only if she is over sixty years of age, [having been] the wife of one man, 
1TI.5.10	and has a reputation for good deeds; [she is eligible] if she has brought up children, if she has shown hospitality to strangers, if she has washed the feet of the saints (God’s people), if she has assisted the distressed, and has devoted herself to doing good in every way. 
1TI.5.11	But refuse [to enroll the] younger widows, for when they feel their natural desires in disregard of Christ, they wish to marry 
1TI.5.12	and so they incur condemnation for having set aside their 
1TI.5.13	Now at the same time, they also learn to be idle as they go from house to house; and not only idle, but also gossips and 
1TI.5.14	So I want younger 
1TI.5.15	Some [widows] have already turned away [from the faith] to follow Satan. 
1TI.5.16	If any believing woman has [dependent] widows [in her household], 
1TI.5.17	The elders who perform their leadership duties well are to be considered worthy of double honor (financial support), especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching [the word of God concerning eternal salvation through Christ]. 
1TI.5.18	For the Scripture says, “Y
1TI.5.19	Do not accept an accusation against an elder unless it is based on [the testimony of at least] two or three witnesses. 
1TI.5.20	As for those [elders] who continue in sin, reprimand them in the presence of all [the congregation], so that the rest will be warned. 
1TI.5.21	I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of His chosen angels that you guard 
1TI.5.22	Do not hurry to lay hands on anyone [ordaining and approving someone for ministry or an office in the church, or in reinstating expelled offenders], and thereby share in the sins of others; keep yourself free from sin.
1TI.5.23	No longer 
1TI.5.25	Likewise, good deeds are quite evident, and those which are otherwise cannot be hidden [indefinitely].
1TI.6.1	All who are under the yoke as bond-servants (slaves) are to regard their own masters as worthy of honor 
1TI.6.2	Those who have believing masters are not to be disrespectful toward them because they are brothers [in Christ], but they should serve them even better, because those who benefit from their kindly service are believers and beloved. Teach and urge these [duties and principles].
1TI.6.3	If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the doctrine 
1TI.6.4	he is conceited and woefully ignorant [understanding nothing]. He has a morbid interest in controversial questions and disputes about words, which produces envy, quarrels, verbal abuse, evil suspicions, 
1TI.6.5	and perpetual friction between men who are corrupted in mind and deprived of the truth, who think that godliness is a source of profit [a lucrative, money-making business—withdraw from them]. 
1TI.6.6	But godliness 
1TI.6.7	For we have brought nothing into the world, so [it is clear that] we cannot take anything out of it, either. 
1TI.6.8	But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content. 
1TI.6.9	But those who [are not financially ethical and] crave to get rich [with a compulsive, greedy longing for wealth] fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction [leading to personal misery]. 
1TI.6.10	For the love of money [that is, the greedy desire for it and the willingness to gain it unethically] is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves [through and through] with many sorrows.
1TI.6.11	But as for you, 
1TI.6.12	Fight the good fight of the faith [in the conflict with evil]; take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and [for which] you made the good confession [of faith] in the presence of many witnesses. 
1TI.6.13	I 
1TI.6.14	to keep all His precepts without stain or reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
1TI.6.15	which He will bring about in His own time—He who is the blessed and only Sovereign [the absolute Ruler], the King of those who reign as kings and Lord of those who rule as lords, 
1TI.6.16	He alone possesses immortality [absolute exemption from death] and lives in unapproachable light, whom no man has ever seen or can see. To Him be honor and eternal power 
1TI.6.17	As for the rich in this present world, instruct them not to be conceited 
1TI.6.18	 to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, willing to share [with others]. 
1TI.6.19	In this way storing up for themselves the 
1TI.6.20	O Timothy, guard 
1TI.6.21	which some have professed and by doing so have erred (missed the mark) 
2TI.1.1	Paul, an apostle (special messenger, personally chosen representative) of Christ Jesus (the Messiah, the Anointed) by the will of God, according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,
2TI.1.2	to Timothy, my beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace [inner calm and spiritual well-being] from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
2TI.1.3	I thank God, whom I worship 
2TI.1.4	and as I recall your tears, I long to see you so that I may be filled with joy. 
2TI.1.5	I remember your sincere 
2TI.1.6	That is why I remind you to 
2TI.1.7	For God did not give us a spirit of timidity 
2TI.1.8	So do not be ashamed to testify about our Lord or about me His prisoner, but with me take your share of suffering for the gospel [continue to preach regardless of the circumstances], in accordance with the power of God [for His power is invincible], 
2TI.1.9	for He delivered us 
2TI.1.10	but now [that extraordinary purpose and grace] has been fully disclosed 
2TI.1.11	for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher [of this good news regarding salvation]. 
2TI.1.12	This is why I suffer as I do. Still, I am not ashamed; for I know Him [and I am personally acquainted with Him] whom I have believed [with absolute trust and confidence in Him and in the truth of His deity], and I am persuaded [beyond any doubt] that He is able to guard that which I have entrusted to Him until 
2TI.1.13	Keep 
2TI.1.14	Guard [with greatest care] 
2TI.1.15	You are aware of the fact that all who are in [the province of] Asia turned away 
2TI.1.16	The Lord grant mercy to the family of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me 
2TI.1.17	but [instead] when he reached Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me— 
2TI.1.18	the Lord grant to him that he may find mercy from the Lord on 
2TI.2.1	So you, my son, be strong [constantly strengthened] 
2TI.2.2	The things [the doctrine, the precepts, the admonitions, the sum of my ministry] which you have heard me teach 
2TI.2.3	Take with me your share of hardship [passing through the difficulties which you are called to endure], like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 
2TI.2.4	No soldier in active service gets entangled in the [ordinary business] affairs of civilian life; [he avoids them] so that he may please the one who enlisted him to serve. 
2TI.2.5	And if anyone competes as an athlete [in competitive games], he is not crowned [with the wreath of victory] unless he competes according to the rules. 
2TI.2.6	The hard-working farmer [who labors to produce crops] ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops. 
2TI.2.7	Think over the things I am saying [grasp their application], for the Lord will grant you insight 
2TI.2.8	Remember Jesus Christ [the ever-living Lord who has] risen from the dead, [as the prophesied King] descended from David [king of Israel], according to my gospel [the good news that I preach], 
2TI.2.9	for that [gospel] I am suffering even to [the point of] wearing chains like a criminal; but the word of God is not chained 
2TI.2.10	For this reason I [am ready to] patiently endure all things for the sake of those who are the elect (God’s chosen ones), so that they too may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus and with it the reward of eternal glory. 
2TI.2.11	This is a faithful 
2TI.2.11	If we died with Him, we will also live with Him;
2TI.2.12	If we endure, we will also reign with Him;
2TI.2.12	If we deny Him, He will also deny us;
2TI.2.13	If we are faithless, He remains faithful [true to His word and His righteous character], for He cannot deny Himself.
2TI.2.14	Remind 
2TI.2.15	Study 
2TI.2.16	But avoid all irreverent babble and godless chatter [with its profane, empty words], for it will lead to further ungodliness, 
2TI.2.17	and their teaching will spread like gangrene. So it is with Hymenaeus and Philetus, 
2TI.2.18	who have deviated from the truth. They claim that the resurrection has already taken place, and they undermine the faith of some. 
2TI.2.19	Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God [which He has laid] stands [sure and unshaken despite attacks], bearing this seal: “The Lord knows those who are His,” and, “Let everyone who names the name of the Lord stand apart from wickedness 
2TI.2.20	Now in a large house there are not only 
2TI.2.21	Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these 
2TI.2.22	Run away from youthful lusts—pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those [believers] who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 
2TI.2.23	But have nothing to do with foolish and ignorant speculations [useless disputes over unedifying, stupid controversies], since you know that they produce strife 
2TI.2.24	The servant of the Lord must not participate in quarrels, but must be kind to everyone [even-tempered, preserving peace, and he must be], skilled in teaching, patient 
2TI.2.25	He must correct those who are in opposition with courtesy 
2TI.2.26	and that they may come to their senses and 
2TI.3.1	But understand this, that in the last days dangerous times [of great stress and trouble] will come [difficult days that will be hard to bear]. 
2TI.3.2	For people will be lovers of self [narcissistic, self-focused], lovers of money [impelled by greed], boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy 
2TI.3.3	[and they will be] unloving [devoid of natural human affection, calloused and inhumane], irreconcilable, malicious gossips, devoid of self-control [intemperate, immoral], brutal, haters of good, 
2TI.3.4	traitors, reckless, conceited, lovers of [sensual] pleasure rather than lovers of God, 
2TI.3.5	holding to a form of [outward] godliness (religion), although they have denied its power [for their conduct nullifies their claim of faith]. Avoid such people 
2TI.3.6	For among them are those who worm their way into homes and captivate 
2TI.3.7	always learning 
2TI.3.8	Just as Jannes and Jambres [the court magicians of Egypt] opposed Moses, so these 
2TI.3.9	But they will not get very far, for their meaningless nonsense 
2TI.3.10	Now you have diligently followed [my example, that is] my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness, 
2TI.3.11	persecutions, and sufferings—such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra; what persecutions I endured, but the Lord rescued me from them all! 
2TI.3.12	Indeed, all who delight in pursuing righteousness 
2TI.3.13	But evil men and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. 
2TI.3.14	But as for you, continue in the things that you have learned and of which you are convinced [holding tightly to the truths], knowing from whom you learned 
2TI.3.15	and how from childhood you have known the sacred writings (Hebrew Scriptures) which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus [surrendering your entire self to Him and having absolute confidence in His wisdom, power and goodness]. 
2TI.3.16	All Scripture is God-breathed [given by divine inspiration] and is profitable for instruction, for conviction [of sin], for correction [of error and restoration to obedience], for training in righteousness [learning to live in conformity to God’s will, both publicly and privately—behaving honorably with personal integrity and moral courage]; 
2TI.3.17	so that the 
2TI.4.1	I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom: 
2TI.4.2	preach the word [as an official messenger]; be ready when the time is right and 
2TI.4.3	For the time will come when people will not tolerate sound doctrine 
2TI.4.4	and will turn their ears away from the truth and will wander off into myths 
2TI.4.5	But as for you, be clear-headed in every situation [stay calm and cool and steady], endure every hardship [without flinching], do the work of an evangelist, fulfill [the duties of] your ministry.
2TI.4.6	For I am already being 
2TI.4.7	I have fought the good 
2TI.4.8	In the future there is reserved for me the [victor’s] crown of righteousness [for being right with God and doing right], which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that [great] day—and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved 
2TI.4.9	Make every effort to come to me soon; 
2TI.4.10	for Demas, having loved [the pleasures of] this present 
2TI.4.11	Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is very helpful to me for the ministry. 
2TI.4.12	But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus. 
2TI.4.13	When you come bring the coat that I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments. 
2TI.4.14	Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm; [but that is no concern of mine, for] the Lord will repay him according to his actions. 
2TI.4.15	Be on guard against him yourself, because he vigorously opposed our message.
2TI.4.16	At my first trial no one supported me [as an advocate] 
2TI.4.17	But the Lord stood by me and strengthened 
2TI.4.18	The Lord will rescue me from every evil assault, and He will bring me safely into His heavenly kingdom; to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
2TI.4.19	Give my greetings to Prisca and Aquila, and to the household of Onesiphorus. 
2TI.4.20	Erastus stayed on at Corinth, but I left Trophimus sick at Miletus. 
2TI.4.21	Try your best to come [to me] before winter. Eubulus wishes to be remembered to you, as do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the 
2TI.4.22	The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.
TIT.1.1	Paul, a bond-servant of God and an apostle (special messenger, personally chosen representative) of Jesus Christ, for the faith of God’s chosen ones and [to lead and encourage them to recognize and pursue] the knowledge of the truth which leads to godliness, 
TIT.1.2	based on the hope 
TIT.1.3	and at the appointed time has made known His word 
TIT.1.4	To Titus, my true child in a common faith: Grace and peace [inner calm and spiritual well-being] from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
TIT.1.5	For this reason I left you 
TIT.1.6	 a man of unquestionable integrity, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, not accused of being immoral or rebellious. 
TIT.1.7	For the 
TIT.1.8	And 
TIT.1.9	He must hold firmly to the trustworthy word [of God] as it was taught to him, so that he will be able both to give accurate instruction in sound [reliable, error-free] doctrine and to refute those who contradict [it by explaining their error].
TIT.1.10	For there are many rebellious men who are empty talkers [just windbags] and deceivers; especially those of the circumcision [those Jews who insist that Gentile believers must be circumcised and keep the Law in order to be saved]. 
TIT.1.11	They must be silenced, because they are upsetting whole families by teaching things they should not teach for the purpose of dishonest 
TIT.1.12	One of them [Epimenides, a Cretan], a 
TIT.1.13	This description is true. So rebuke them sharply so that they will be sound in the faith 
TIT.1.14	not paying attention to Jewish myths and the commandments 
TIT.1.15	To the pure, all things are pure; but to the corrupt and unbelieving, nothing is pure; both their mind and their conscience are corrupted. 
TIT.1.16	They profess to know God [to recognize and be acquainted with Him], but by 
TIT.2.1	But as for you, teach the things which are in agreement with sound doctrine [which produces men and women of good character whose lifestyle identifies them as true Christians]. 
TIT.2.2	Older men are to be temperate, dignified, sensible, sound in faith, in love, in steadfastness [Christlike in character].
TIT.2.3	Older women similarly are to be reverent in their behavior, not malicious gossips nor addicted to much wine, teaching what is right 
TIT.2.4	so that they may encourage the young women to tenderly love their husbands and their children, 
TIT.2.5	to be sensible, pure, makers of a home [where God is honored], good-natured, being subject to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be dishonored.
TIT.2.6	In a similar way urge the young men to be sensible 
TIT.2.7	And in all things show yourself to be an example of good works, with purity in doctrine [having the strictest regard for integrity and truth], dignified, 
TIT.2.8	sound 
TIT.2.9	Urge bond-servants to be subject to their own masters in everything, to be pleasing and not talk back, 
TIT.2.10	not stealing [things, regardless of value], but proving themselves trustworthy, so that in every respect they will adorn 
TIT.2.11	For the [remarkable, undeserved] grace of God that 
TIT.2.12	It teaches us to reject ungodliness and worldly (immoral) desires, and to live sensible, upright, and godly lives [with a purpose that reflect spiritual maturity] in this present age, 
TIT.2.13	awaiting 
TIT.2.14	who [willingly] gave Himself [to be crucified] on our behalf to redeem us 
TIT.2.15	Tell 
TIT.3.1	Remind people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready 
TIT.3.2	to slander 
TIT.3.3	For we too once were foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved to various 
TIT.3.4	But when the goodness 
TIT.3.5	He saved us, not because of any works of righteousness that we have done, but because of His own compassion 
TIT.3.6	whom He poured out richly upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior, 
TIT.3.7	so that we would be justified [made free of the guilt of sin] by His [compassionate, undeserved] grace, and that we would be [acknowledged as acceptable to Him and] made heirs of eternal life [actually experiencing it] according to our hope (His guarantee). 
TIT.3.8	This is a faithful 
TIT.3.9	But avoid foolish 
TIT.3.10	After a first and second warning reject a divisive man [who promotes heresy and causes dissension—ban him from your fellowship and have nothing more to do with him], 
TIT.3.11	well aware that such a person is twisted and is sinning; he is convicted 
TIT.3.12	When I send Artemas or [perhaps] Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there. 
TIT.3.13	Do your best to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way; see that they are supplied 
TIT.3.14	Our people must learn to do good deeds to meet necessary demands [whatever the occasion may require], so that they will not be unproductive.
TIT.3.15	All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith.
PHM.1.1	Paul, a prisoner [for the sake] of Christ Jesus (the Messiah, the Anointed), and our brother Timothy,
PHM.1.2	and to [your wife] Apphia our sister, and to 
PHM.1.3	Grace to you and peace [inner calm and spiritual well-being] from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
PHM.1.4	I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers, 
PHM.1.5	because I hear of your love and of your faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the 
PHM.1.6	I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective 
PHM.1.7	For I have had great joy and comfort 
PHM.1.8	Therefore [on the basis of these facts], though I have enough confidence in Christ to order you to do what is appropriate, 
PHM.1.9	yet for love’s sake I prefer to appeal 
PHM.1.10	I appeal to you for my [own spiritual] child Onesimus, whom I have fathered [in the faith] while a captive in these chains. 
PHM.1.11	Once he was useless to you, but now he is indeed 
PHM.1.12	I have sent him back to you in person, that is, 
PHM.1.13	I would have chosen to keep him with me, so that he might minister to me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel; 
PHM.1.14	but I did not want to do anything without first getting your consent, so that your goodness would not be, in effect, by compulsion but of your own free will. 
PHM.1.15	Perhaps it was for this reason that he was separated from you for a while, so that you would have him back forever, 
PHM.1.16	no longer as a slave, but [as someone] more than a slave, as a brother [in Christ], especially dear to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh [as a servant] and in the Lord [as a fellow believer].
PHM.1.17	So if you consider me a partner, welcome 
PHM.1.18	But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge that to my account; 
PHM.1.19	I, Paul, write this with my 
PHM.1.20	Yes, brother, let me have some benefit 
PHM.1.21	I write to you [perfectly] confident of your obedient compliance, 
PHM.1.22	At the same time also prepare a guest room for me [in expectation of a visit], for I hope that through your prayers I will be [granted the gracious privilege of] coming to you [at Colossae].
PHM.1.23	Greetings to you from Epaphras, my fellow prisoner here in [the cause of] Christ Jesus, 
PHM.1.24	and from Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
PHM.1.25	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
HEB.1.1	God, having spoken to the fathers long ago in [the voices and writings of] the prophets in many separate revelations [each of which set forth a portion of the truth], and in many ways, 
HEB.1.2	has in these last days spoken [with finality] to us in [the person of One who is by His character and nature] His Son [namely Jesus], whom He appointed heir 
HEB.1.3	The Son is the radiance 
HEB.1.4	having become as much superior to angels, since He has inherited a more excellent 
HEB.1.5	For to which of the angels did the Father ever say,
HEB.1.5	“Y
HEB.1.5	T
HEB.1.5	And again [did He ever say to the angels],
HEB.1.5	“I

HEB.1.7	And concerning the angels He says,
HEB.1.7	“W

HEB.1.8	But about the Son [the Father says to Him],
HEB.1.8	“Y

HEB.1.10	And,

HEB.1.12	A
HEB.1.12	L
HEB.1.12	B
HEB.1.12	A
HEB.1.13	But to which of the angels has the Father ever said,
HEB.1.13	“S
HEB.1.13	U
HEB.1.13	A 
HEB.1.14	Are not all the angels ministering spirits sent out [by God] to serve (accompany, protect) those who will inherit salvation? [Of course they are!]
HEB.2.2	For if the message given 
HEB.2.3	how will we escape [the penalty] if we ignore such a great salvation [the gospel, the new covenant]? For it was spoken at first by the Lord, and it was confirmed to us 
HEB.2.4	[and besides this evidence] God also testifying with them [confirming the message of salvation], both by signs and wonders and by various miracles [carried out by Jesus and the apostles] and by [granting to believers the] gifts of the Holy Spirit according to His own will.
HEB.2.5	It was not to angels that God subjected the [inhabited] world of the future [when Christ reigns], about which we are speaking. 
HEB.2.6	But one has [solemnly] testified somewhere [in Scripture], saying,
HEB.2.6	“W
HEB.2.6	O
HEB.2.7	Y
HEB.2.7	Y
HEB.2.8	Y
HEB.2.8	Now in putting all things in subjection to man, He left nothing outside his control. But at present we do not yet see all things subjected to him.
HEB.2.9	But we do see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a little while [by taking on the limitations of humanity], crowned with glory and honor because of His suffering of death, so that by the grace of God [extended to sinners] He might experience death for [the sins of] everyone.
HEB.2.10	For it was fitting for God [that is, an act worthy of His divine nature] that He, for whose sake are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the 
HEB.2.11	Both Jesus who sanctifies and those who are sanctified [that is, spiritually transformed, made holy, and set apart for God’s purpose] are all from one 
HEB.2.12	saying,
HEB.2.12	“I 
HEB.2.12	I
HEB.2.13	And again [
HEB.2.13	“M
HEB.2.13	And again,
HEB.2.13	“H
HEB.2.14	Therefore, since [these His] children share in flesh and blood [the physical nature of mankind], He Himself in a similar manner also shared in the same [physical nature, but without sin], so that through [experiencing] death He might make powerless (ineffective, impotent) him who had the power of death—that is, the devil— 
HEB.2.15	and [that He] might free all those who through [the haunting] fear of death were held in slavery throughout their lives. 
HEB.2.16	For, as we all know, He (Christ) does not take hold of [the fallen] angels [to give them a helping hand], but He does take hold of [the fallen] descendants of Abraham [extending to them His hand of deliverance]. 
HEB.2.17	Therefore, 
HEB.2.18	Because He Himself [in His humanity] has suffered in being tempted, He is able to help 
HEB.3.1	Therefore, 
HEB.3.2	He was faithful to Him who appointed Him [Apostle and High Priest], as Moses also was 
HEB.3.3	Yet Jesus has been considered worthy of much greater glory 
HEB.3.4	For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God. 
HEB.3.5	Now Moses was faithful in [the administration of] all God’s house, [but only] as a 
HEB.3.6	but Christ is faithful as a Son over His [Father’s] house. And we are His house if we hold fast our confidence and sense of triumph in our hope [in Christ].
HEB.3.7	Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says,
HEB.3.7	“T
HEB.3.8	D
HEB.3.8	O
HEB.3.9	W
HEB.3.9	A
HEB.3.9	[And found I stood their test].

HEB.3.10	A
HEB.3.10	A
HEB.3.11	S
HEB.3.11	‘T
HEB.3.12	Take care, brothers and sisters, that there not be in any one of you a wicked, unbelieving 
HEB.3.13	But continually encourage one another every day, as long as it is called “Today” [and there is an opportunity], so that none of you will be hardened [into settled rebellion] by the deceitfulness of sin [its cleverness, delusive glamour, and sophistication]. 
HEB.3.14	For we [believers] have become partakers of Christ [sharing in all that the Messiah has for us], if only we hold firm our newborn confidence [which originally led us to Him] until the end, 
HEB.3.15	while it is said,
HEB.3.15	“T
HEB.3.15	D
HEB.3.16	For who were they who heard and yet provoked 
HEB.3.17	And with whom was He angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies were scattered in the desert? 
HEB.3.18	And to whom did He swear [an oath] that they would not enter His rest, but to those who disobeyed [those who would not listen to His word]? 
HEB.3.19	So we see that they were not able to enter [into His rest—the promised land] because of unbelief 
HEB.4.1	Therefore, while the promise of entering His rest still remains 
HEB.4.2	For indeed we have had the good news [of salvation] preached to us, just as the Israelites also [when the good news of the promised land came to them]; but the message they heard did not benefit them, because it was not united with faith [in God] by those who heard. 
HEB.4.3	For we who believe [that is, we who personally trust and confidently rely on God] enter that rest [so we have His inner peace now because we are confident in our salvation, and assured of His power], just as He has said,
HEB.4.3	“A
HEB.4.3	T
HEB.4.3	[this He said] although His works were 
HEB.4.4	For somewhere [in Scripture] He has said this about the seventh day: “A
HEB.4.5	and again in this, “T
HEB.4.6	Therefore, since the promise remains for some to enter His rest, and those who formerly had the good news preached to them failed to [grasp it and did not] enter because of [their unbelief evidenced by] disobedience, 
HEB.4.7	He again sets a definite day, [a new] “Today,” [providing another opportunity to enter that rest by] saying through David after so long a time, just as has been said before [in the words already quoted],
HEB.4.7	“T
HEB.4.7	D
HEB.4.8	[This mention of a rest was not a reference to their entering into Canaan.] For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not speak about another day [of opportunity] after that. 
HEB.4.9	So there remains a [full and complete] Sabbath rest for the people of God. 
HEB.4.10	For the one who has once entered His rest has also rested from [the weariness and pain of] his [human] labors, just as God rested from [those labors uniquely] His own. 
HEB.4.11	Let us therefore make every effort to enter that rest [of God, to know and experience it for ourselves], so that no one will fall by 
HEB.4.12	For the word of God is living and active 
HEB.4.13	And not a creature exists that is concealed from His sight, but all things are open 
HEB.4.14	Inasmuch then as we [believers] have a great High Priest who has [already ascended and] passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession [of faith and cling tenaciously to our absolute trust in Him as Savior]. 
HEB.4.15	For we do not have a High Priest who is unable to sympathize 
HEB.4.16	Therefore let us [with privilege] approach the throne of grace [that is, the throne of God’s gracious favor] with confidence 
HEB.5.1	For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed [to act] on behalf of men in things relating to God, so that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins. 
HEB.5.2	He is able to deal gently with the 
HEB.5.3	and because of this [human weakness] he is required to offer 
HEB.5.4	And besides, one does not appropriate for himself the honor [of being high priest], but he who is called by God, just as Aaron was.
HEB.5.5	So too Christ did not glorify Himself so as to be made a high priest, but He [was exalted and appointed by the One] who said to Him,
HEB.5.5	“Y
HEB.5.5	T
HEB.5.6	just as He also says in another place,
HEB.5.6	“Y
HEB.5.6	A
HEB.5.7	In the days of His earthly life, Jesus offered up both [specific] petitions and [urgent] supplications [for that which He needed] with fervent crying and tears to the One who was [always] able to save Him from death, and He was heard because of His reverent submission toward God [His sinlessness and His unfailing determination to do the Father’s will]. 
HEB.5.8	Although He was a Son [who had never been disobedient to the Father], He learned [active, special] obedience through what He suffered. 
HEB.5.9	And having been made perfect [uniquely equipped and prepared as Savior and retaining His integrity amid opposition], He became the source of eternal salvation [an eternal inheritance] to all those who obey Him, 
HEB.5.10	being designated by God as High Priest according to the order of 
HEB.5.11	Concerning this we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull 
HEB.5.12	For though by this time you ought to be teachers [because of the time you have had to learn these truths], you actually need someone to teach you again the elementary principles of God’s word [from the beginning], and you have come to be 
HEB.5.13	For everyone who lives on milk is [doctrinally inexperienced and] unskilled in the word of righteousness, since he is a 
HEB.5.14	But solid food is for the [spiritually] mature, whose senses are trained by practice to distinguish between what is morally good and 
HEB.6.1	Therefore let us get past the elementary stage in the teachings about the Christ, advancing on to maturity 
HEB.6.2	of teaching about washings (ritual purifications), the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. [These are all important matters in which you should have been proficient long ago.] 
HEB.6.3	And we will do this [that is, proceed to maturity], if God permits. 
HEB.6.4	For [it is impossible to restore to repentance] those who have once been enlightened [spiritually] and who have 
HEB.6.5	and have tasted 
HEB.6.6	and then have fallen away—it is impossible to bring them back again to repentance, since they again nail the Son of God on the cross [for as far as they are concerned, they are treating the death of Christ as if they were not saved by it], and are holding Him up again to public disgrace. 
HEB.6.7	For soil that drinks the rain which often falls on it and produces crops useful to those for whose benefit it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God; 
HEB.6.8	but if it persistently produces thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to being cursed, and it ends up being burned.
HEB.6.9	But, beloved, even though we speak to you in this way, 
HEB.6.10	For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown for His name in ministering to [the needs of] the saints (God’s people), as you do. 
HEB.6.11	And we desire for each one of you to show the same diligence [all the way through] so as to realize 
HEB.6.12	so that you will not be [spiritually] sluggish, but [will instead be] imitators of those who through faith [lean on God with absolute trust and confidence in Him and in His power] and by patient endurance [even when suffering] are [now] inheriting the promises.
HEB.6.13	For when God made the promise to Abraham, He swore [an oath] by Himself, since He had no one greater by whom to swear, 
HEB.6.14	saying, “I 
HEB.6.15	And so, having patiently waited, he realized the promise [in the miraculous birth of Isaac, as a pledge of what was to come from God]. 
HEB.6.16	Indeed men swear [an oath] by 
HEB.6.17	In the same way God, in His desire to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable nature of His purpose, intervened 
HEB.6.18	so that by two unchangeable things [His promise and His oath] in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled [to Him] for refuge would have strong encouragement 
HEB.6.19	This hope [this confident assurance] we have as an anchor of the soul [it cannot slip and it cannot break down under whatever pressure bears upon it]—a safe and steadfast hope that enters within the veil [of the heavenly temple, that most Holy Place in which the very presence of God dwells], 
HEB.6.20	where Jesus has entered [in advance] as a forerunner for us, having become a High Priest forever according to the order of 
HEB.7.1	For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham as he returned from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, 
HEB.7.2	and Abraham gave him a tenth of all [the spoil]. He is, first of all, by the translation 
HEB.7.3	Without [
HEB.7.4	Now pause 
HEB.7.5	It is true that those descendants of Levi who are charged with the priestly office are commanded in the Law to collect tithes from the people—which means, from their kinsmen—though these have descended from Abraham. 
HEB.7.6	But this person [Melchizedek] who is not from their Levitical ancestry received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who possessed the promises [of God]. 
HEB.7.7	Yet it is beyond all dispute that the lesser person is 
HEB.7.8	Furthermore, here [in the Levitical priesthood] tithes are received by men who are subject to death; but in that case [concerning Melchizedek], 
HEB.7.9	A person might even say that Levi [the father of the priestly tribe] himself, who received tithes, paid tithes through Abraham [the father of all Israel and of all who believe], 
HEB.7.10	for Levi was still in the loins (unborn) of his forefather [Abraham] when Melchizedek met him (Abraham).
HEB.7.11	Now if perfection [a perfect fellowship between God and the worshiper] had been attained through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people were given the Law) what further need was there for another 
HEB.7.12	For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is of necessity a change of the law [concerning the priesthood] as well. 
HEB.7.13	For the One of whom these things are said belonged [not to the priestly line of Levi but] to another tribe, from which no one has officiated 
HEB.7.14	For it is evident that our Lord descended from [the tribe of] Judah, and Moses mentioned nothing about priests in connection with that tribe. 
HEB.7.15	And this becomes even more evident if another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek, 
HEB.7.16	who has become 
HEB.7.17	For it is attested [by God] of Him,
HEB.7.17	“Y
HEB.7.17	A
HEB.7.18	For, on the one hand, a former commandment is cancelled because of its weakness and uselessness [because of its inability to justify the sinner before God] 
HEB.7.19	(for the Law never made anything perfect); while on the other hand a better hope is introduced through which we now 
HEB.7.20	And indeed it was not without the taking of an oath [that Christ was made priest] 
HEB.7.21	(for those 
HEB.7.21	“T
HEB.7.21	A
HEB.7.21	‘Y
HEB.7.22	And so [because of the oath’s greater strength and force] Jesus has become the certain guarantee of a better covenant [a more excellent and more advantageous agreement; one that will never be replaced or annulled].
HEB.7.23	The [former successive line of] priests, on the one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were each prevented by death from continuing [perpetually in office]; 
HEB.7.24	but, on the other hand, Jesus holds His priesthood permanently 
HEB.7.25	Therefore He is able also to save forever (completely, perfectly, for eternity) those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to intercede 
HEB.7.26	It was fitting for us to have such a High Priest [perfectly adapted to our needs], holy, blameless, unstained [by sin], separated from sinners and exalted higher than the heavens; 
HEB.7.27	who has no day by day need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices, first of all for his own [personal] sins and then for those of the people, because He [met all the requirements and] did this once for all when He offered up Himself [as a willing sacrifice]. 
HEB.7.28	For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak [frail, sinful, dying men], but the word of the oath [of God], which came after [the institution of] the Law, 
HEB.8.1	Now the main point of what we have to say 
HEB.8.2	a Minister (Officiating Priest) in the holy places and in the true tabernacle, which is erected not by man, but by the Lord. 
HEB.8.3	For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it is essential for this One also to have something to offer. 
HEB.8.4	Now if He were [still living] on earth, He would not be a priest at all, for there are priests who offer the gifts [to God] in accordance with the Law. 
HEB.8.5	They serve as a pattern and foreshadowing of [what has its true existence and reality in] the heavenly things (sanctuary). For when Moses was about to erect the tabernacle, he was warned 
HEB.8.6	But as it is, Christ has acquired a [priestly] ministry which is more excellent [than the old Levitical priestly ministry], for He is the Mediator (Arbiter) of a better covenant [uniting God and man], which has been enacted 
HEB.8.7	For if that first 
HEB.8.8	However, God finds fault with them [showing its inadequacy] when He says,
HEB.8.8	“B

HEB.8.12	A
HEB.8.13	When God speaks of “A new 
HEB.9.1	Now even the first 
HEB.9.2	A tabernacle (sacred tent) was put up, the outer one 
HEB.9.3	Behind the second veil there was another tabernacle [the inner one or second section] known as the Holy of Holies, 
HEB.9.4	having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered entirely with gold. This contained a golden jar which held the manna, and the rod of Aaron that sprouted, and the [two stone] tablets of the covenant [inscribed with the Ten Commandments]; 
HEB.9.5	and above the ark were the [golden] cherubim of glory overshadowing 
HEB.9.6	Now when these things have been prepared in this way, the priests continually enter the outer [or first section of the] tabernacle [that is, the Holy Place] performing [their ritual acts of] the divine worship, 
HEB.9.7	but into the second [inner tabernacle, the Holy of Holies], only the high priest 
HEB.9.8	By this the Holy Spirit signifies that the way into the Holy Place [the true Holy of Holies and the presence of God] has not yet been disclosed as long as the 
HEB.9.9	for this [first or outer tabernacle] is a symbol [that is, an archetype or paradigm] for the present time. Accordingly both gifts and sacrifices are offered which are incapable of perfecting the conscience 
HEB.9.10	For they [the gifts, sacrifices, and ceremonies] deal only with [clean and unclean] food and drink and various ritual washings, [mere] external regulations for the body imposed [to help the worshipers] until the time of reformation [that is, the time of the new order when Christ will establish the reality of what these things foreshadow—a better covenant].
HEB.9.11	But when Christ appeared as a High Priest of the good things to come [that is, true spiritual worship], 
HEB.9.12	He went once for all into the Holy Place [the Holy of Holies of heaven, into the presence of God], and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, having obtained 
HEB.9.13	For if the sprinkling of [ceremonially] defiled persons with the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a [burnt] heifer is sufficient for the cleansing of the body, 
HEB.9.14	how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal [Holy] Spirit 
HEB.9.15	For this reason He is the Mediator 
HEB.9.16	For where there is a will 
HEB.9.17	for a will 
HEB.9.18	So even the first 
HEB.9.19	For when every commandment in the Law had been read by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of the calves and goats [which had been sacrificed], together with water and scarlet wool and with a bunch of hyssop, and he sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people, 
HEB.9.20	saying, “T
HEB.9.21	And in the same way he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the containers 
HEB.9.22	In fact under the Law almost everything is cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness [neither release from sin and its guilt, nor cancellation of the merited punishment].
HEB.9.23	Therefore it was necessary for the [earthly] copies of the heavenly things to be cleansed with these, but the heavenly things themselves required far better sacrifices than these. 
HEB.9.24	For Christ did not enter into a holy place made with hands, a mere copy of the true one, but [He entered] into heaven itself, now to appear in the very presence of God on our behalf; 
HEB.9.25	nor did He [enter into the heavenly sanctuary to] offer Himself again and again, as the high priest enters the Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own. 
HEB.9.26	Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer over and over since the foundation of the world; but now once for all at the consummation of the ages He has appeared 
HEB.9.27	And just as it is appointed 
HEB.9.28	so Christ, having been offered once 
HEB.10.1	For since the Law has only a shadow [just a pale representation] of the good things to come—not the very image of those things—it can never, by offering the same sacrifices continually year after year, make 
HEB.10.2	For if it were otherwise, would not these sacrifices have stopped being offered? For the worshipers, having once [for all time] been cleansed, would no longer have a consciousness of sin. 
HEB.10.3	But [as it is] these [continual] 
HEB.10.4	for it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. 
HEB.10.5	Therefore, when Christ enters into the world, He says,

HEB.10.11	Every priest stands [at his altar of service] ministering daily, offering the same sacrifices over and over, which are never able

HEB.11.5	By faith [that pleased God] Enoch was caught up 
HEB.11.6	But without faith it is impossible to [walk with God and] please Him, for whoever comes [near] to God must [necessarily] believe that God exists and that He rewards those who [earnestly and diligently] seek Him. 
HEB.11.7	By faith [with confidence in God and His word] Noah, being warned 
HEB.11.8	By faith Abraham, when he was called [by God], obeyed by going to a place which he was to receive as an inheritance; and he went, not knowing where he was going. 
HEB.11.9	By faith he lived as a foreigner in the promised land, as in a strange 
HEB.11.10	For he was [waiting expectantly and confidently] looking forward to the city which has foundations, [an eternal, heavenly city] whose architect and builder is God. 
HEB.11.11	By faith even Sarah herself received the ability to conceive [a child], even [when she was long] past the normal age for it, because she considered Him who had given her the promise to be reliable 
HEB.11.12	So from one man, though he was [physically] as good as dead, were born 
HEB.11.13	All these died in faith [guided and sustained by it], without receiving the [tangible fulfillment of God’s] promises, only having seen (anticipated) them and having welcomed them from a distance, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. 
HEB.11.14	Now those who say such things make it clear that they are looking for a country of their own. 
HEB.11.15	And if they had been thinking of that 
HEB.11.16	But the truth is that they were longing for a better country, that is, a heavenly one. For that reason God is not ashamed [of them or] to be called their God [even to be surnamed their God—the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob]; for He has prepared a city for them.
HEB.11.17	By faith Abraham, when he was tested [that is, as the testing of his faith was still in progress], 
HEB.11.18	to whom it was said, “T
HEB.11.19	For he considered [it reasonable to believe] that God was able to raise 
HEB.11.20	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau [believing what God revealed to him], even regarding things to come. 
HEB.11.21	By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and bowed in worship, 
HEB.11.22	By faith Joseph, when he was dying, referred to [the promise of God for] the exodus of the sons of Israel [from Egypt], and gave instructions concerning [the burial of] his bones [in the land of the promise].
HEB.11.23	By faith Moses, after his birth, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful 
HEB.11.24	By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, 
HEB.11.25	because he preferred to endure the hardship of the people of God rather than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin. 
HEB.11.26	He considered the reproach of the 
HEB.11.27	By faith he left Egypt, being unafraid of the wrath of the king; for he endured [steadfastly], as seeing Him who is unseen. 
HEB.11.28	By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood [on the doorposts], so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch them (the firstborn of Israel). 
HEB.11.29	By faith the people [of Israel] crossed the Red Sea as though 
HEB.11.30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days [by Joshua and the sons of Israel]. 
HEB.11.31	By faith Rahab the prostitute was not destroyed along with those who were disobedient, because she had welcomed the spies [sent by the sons of Israel] in peace.
HEB.11.32	And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets, 
HEB.11.33	who by faith [that is, with an enduring trust in God and His promises] subdued kingdoms, administered justice, obtained promised blessings, closed the mouths of lions, 
HEB.11.34	extinguished the power of [raging] fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became mighty 
HEB.11.35	Women received back their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured [to death], refusing to accept release [offered on the condition of denying their faith], so that they would be resurrected to a better life; 
HEB.11.36	and others experienced the trial of mocking and scourging [amid torture], and even chains and imprisonment. 
HEB.11.37	They were stoned [to death], they were sawn in two, they were lured with tempting offers [to renounce their faith], they were put to death by the sword; they went about wrapped in the skins of sheep and goats, utterly destitute, oppressed, cruelly treated 
HEB.11.38	(people of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and [living in] caves and holes in the ground.
HEB.11.39	And all of these, though they gained [divine] approval through their faith, did not receive [the fulfillment of] what was promised, 
HEB.11.40	because God had us in mind 
HEB.12.1	Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of 
HEB.12.2	[looking away from all that will distract us and] focusing our eyes on Jesus, who is the Author and Perfecter of faith [the first incentive for our belief and the One who brings our faith to maturity], who for the joy [of accomplishing the goal] set before Him endured the cross, 
HEB.12.3	Just consider 
HEB.12.4	You have not yet struggled to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin; 
HEB.12.5	and you have 
HEB.12.5	“M
HEB.12.5	A
HEB.12.6	F
HEB.12.6	A
HEB.12.7	You must submit to [correction for the purpose of] discipline; God is dealing with you as with sons; for 
HEB.12.8	Now if you are exempt from correction 
HEB.12.9	Moreover, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us, and we submitted 
HEB.12.10	For our earthly fathers disciplined us for only a short time as seemed best to them; but He 
HEB.12.11	For the time being no discipline brings joy, but seems sad 
HEB.12.12	So then, strengthen hands that are weak and knees that tremble. 
HEB.12.13	Cut through 
HEB.12.15	See to it that no one falls short of God’s grace; that no root of resentment springs up and causes trouble, and by it many be defiled; 
HEB.12.16	and [see to it] that no one is immoral or godless like Esau, who sold his own birthright for a 
HEB.12.17	For you know that later on, when he wanted [to regain title to] his inheritance of the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no opportunity for repentance [there was no way to repair what he had done, no chance to recall the choice he had made], even though he sought for it with [bitter] tears.
HEB.12.18	For you have not come [as did the Israelites in the wilderness] to 
HEB.12.19	and to the blast of a trumpet and a sound of words [such that] those who heard it begged that nothing more be said to them. 
HEB.12.20	For they could not bear the command, “I
HEB.12.21	In fact, so terrifying was the sight, that Moses said, “I 
HEB.12.22	But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels [in festive gathering], 
HEB.12.23	and to the general assembly and assembly of the firstborn who are registered [as citizens] in heaven, and to God, who is Judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous (the redeemed in heaven) who have been made perfect [bringing them to their final glory], 
HEB.12.24	and to Jesus, the Mediator of a new covenant [uniting God and man], and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks [of mercy], a better 
HEB.12.25	See to it that you do not refuse [to listen to] Him who is speaking [to you now]. For if those [sons of Israel] did not escape when they refused [to listen to] him who warned them on earth [revealing God’s will], how much less will we 
HEB.12.26	His voice shook the earth [at Mount Sinai] then, but now He has given a promise, saying, “Y
HEB.12.27	Now this [expression], “Yet once more,” indicates the removal 
HEB.12.28	Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude, and offer to God pleasing service 
HEB.12.29	for our God is [indeed] a consuming fire.
HEB.13.1	Let love of your fellow believers continue. 
HEB.13.2	Do not neglect to extend hospitality to strangers [especially among the family of believers—being friendly, cordial, and gracious, sharing the comforts of your home and doing your part generously], for by this some have entertained angels without knowing it. 
HEB.13.3	Remember those who are in prison, as if you were their fellow prisoner, and those who are mistreated, since you also are in the body [and subject to physical suffering]. 
HEB.13.4	Marriage 
HEB.13.5	Let your character [your moral essence, your inner nature] be free from the love of money [shun greed—be financially ethical], being content with what you have; for He has said, “I 
HEB.13.6	So we take comfort 
HEB.13.6	“T
HEB.13.6	W
HEB.13.7	Remember your leaders [for it was they] who brought you the word of God; and consider the result of their conduct [the outcome of their godly lives], and imitate their faith [their conviction that God exists and is the Creator and Ruler of all things, the Provider of eternal salvation through Christ, and imitate their reliance on God with absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness]. 
HEB.13.8	Jesus Christ is [eternally changeless, always] the same yesterday and today and forever. 
HEB.13.9	Do not be carried away by diverse and strange teachings; for it is good for the heart to be established 
HEB.13.10	We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle (sacred tent) have no right to eat. 
HEB.13.11	For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest 
HEB.13.12	Therefore Jesus also suffered 
HEB.13.13	So, let us go out to Him outside the 
HEB.13.14	For here we have no lasting city, but we are seeking 
HEB.13.15	Through Him, therefore, let us at all times offer up to God a sacrifice of praise, which is the fruit of lips that thankfully acknowledge 
HEB.13.16	Do not neglect to do good, to contribute [to the needy of the church as an expression of fellowship], for such sacrifices are always pleasing to God.
HEB.13.17	Obey your [spiritual] leaders and submit to them [recognizing their authority over you], for they are keeping watch over your souls 
HEB.13.18	Keep praying for us, for we are convinced that we have a good conscience, seeking to conduct ourselves honorably [that is, with moral courage and personal integrity] in all things. 
HEB.13.19	And I urge all of you to pray earnestly, so that I may be restored to you soon.
HEB.13.20	Now may the God of peace [the source of serenity and spiritual well-being] who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood 
HEB.13.21	equip you with every good thing to carry out His will 
HEB.13.22	I call on you, brothers and sisters, listen [patiently] to this message of exhortation 
HEB.13.23	Notice that our brother Timothy has been released [from prison]. If he comes soon, I will see you [along with him]. 
HEB.13.24	Give our greetings to all of your [spiritual] leaders and to all of the saints (God’s people). Those [Christians] from Italy send you their greetings.
HEB.13.25	Grace be with you all.
JAS.1.2	Consider it nothing but joy, my 
JAS.1.3	Be assured that the testing of your faith [through experience] produces endurance [leading to spiritual maturity, and inner peace]. 
JAS.1.4	And let endurance have its perfect result 
JAS.1.5	If any of you lacks wisdom [to guide him through a decision or circumstance], he is to ask of [our benevolent] God, who gives to everyone generously and without rebuke 
JAS.1.6	But he must ask [for wisdom] in faith, without doubting [God’s willingness to help], for the one who doubts is like a billowing surge of the sea that is blown about and tossed by the wind. 
JAS.1.7	For such a person ought not to think 
JAS.1.8	 a double-minded man, unstable 
JAS.1.9	Let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high position [as a born-again believer, called to the true riches and to be an heir of God]; 
JAS.1.10	and the rich man 
JAS.1.11	For the sun rises with a scorching wind and withers the grass; its flower falls off and 
JAS.1.12	Blessed [happy, spiritually prosperous, favored by God] is the man who is steadfast under trial 
JAS.1.13	Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am being tempted by God” [for temptation does not originate from God, but from our own flaws]; for God cannot be tempted by [what is] evil, and He Himself tempts no one. 
JAS.1.14	But each one is tempted when he is dragged away, enticed 
JAS.1.15	Then when the illicit desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin has run its course, it gives birth to death. 
JAS.1.16	Do not be misled, my beloved brothers and sisters. 
JAS.1.17	Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above; it comes down from the Father of lights [the Creator and Sustainer of the heavens], in whom there is no variation [no rising or setting] or shadow 
JAS.1.18	It was of His own will that He gave us birth [as His children] by the word of truth, so that we would be a kind of first fruits of His creatures [a prime example of what He created to be set apart to Himself—sanctified, made holy for His divine purposes].
JAS.1.19	Understand this, my beloved brothers and sisters. Let everyone be quick to hear [be a careful, thoughtful listener], slow to speak [a speaker of carefully chosen words and], slow to anger [patient, reflective, forgiving]; 
JAS.1.20	for the [resentful, deep-seated] anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God [that standard of behavior which He requires from us]. 
JAS.1.21	So get rid of all uncleanness and 
JAS.1.22	But prove yourselves doers of the word [actively and continually obeying God’s precepts], and not merely listeners [who hear the word but fail to internalize its meaning], deluding yourselves [by unsound reasoning contrary to the truth]. 
JAS.1.23	For if anyone only listens to the word 
JAS.1.24	for 
JAS.1.25	But he who looks carefully into the perfect law, the 
JAS.1.26	If anyone thinks himself to be religious [scrupulously observant of the rituals of his faith], and does not control his tongue but deludes his 
JAS.1.27	Pure and unblemished religion [as it is expressed in outward acts] in the sight of our God and Father is this: to visit 
JAS.2.1	My fellow believers, do not practice your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with 
JAS.2.2	For if a man comes into your 
JAS.2.3	and you pay special attention to the one who wears the 
JAS.2.4	have you not discriminated among yourselves, and become judges with wrong motives? 
JAS.2.5	Listen, my beloved brothers and sisters: has not God chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and [as believers to be] heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him? 
JAS.2.6	But you [in contrast] have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress 
JAS.2.7	Do they not blaspheme the 
JAS.2.8	If, however, you are [really] fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture, “Y
JAS.2.9	But if you show partiality [prejudice, favoritism], you are committing sin and are convicted by the Law as offenders. 
JAS.2.10	For whoever keeps the whole Law but stumbles in one 
JAS.2.11	For He who said, “D
JAS.2.12	Speak and act [consistently] as people who are going to be judged by the law of liberty [that moral law that frees obedient Christians from the bondage of sin]. 
JAS.2.13	For judgment 
JAS.2.14	What is the benefit, my fellow believers, if someone claims to have faith but has no [good] works [as evidence]? Can that [kind of] faith save him? [No, a mere claim of faith is not sufficient—genuine faith produces good works.] 
JAS.2.15	If a brother or sister is without [adequate] clothing and lacks [enough] food for each day, 
JAS.2.16	and one of you says to them, “Go in peace [with my blessing], [keep] warm and feed yourselves,” but he does not give them the necessities for the body, what good does that do? 
JAS.2.17	So too, faith, if it does not have works [to back it up], is by itself dead [inoperative and ineffective].
JAS.2.18	But someone may say, “You [claim to] have faith and I have [good] works; show me your [alleged] faith without the works [if you can], and I will show you my faith by my works [that is, by what I do].” 
JAS.2.19	You believe that 
JAS.2.20	But are you willing to recognize, you foolish [spiritually shallow] person, that faith without [good] works is useless? 
JAS.2.21	Was our father Abraham not [shown to be] justified by works [of obedience which expressed his faith] when he offered Isaac his son on the altar [as a sacrifice to God]? 
JAS.2.22	You see that [his] faith was working together with his works, and as a result of the works, his faith was completed [reaching its maturity when he expressed his faith through obedience]. 
JAS.2.23	And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “A
JAS.2.24	You see that a man (believer) is justified by works and not by faith alone [that is, by acts of obedience a born-again believer reveals his faith]. 
JAS.2.25	In the same way, was Rahab the prostitute not justified by works too, when she received the [Hebrew] 
JAS.2.26	For just as the [human] body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works [of obedience] is also dead.
JAS.3.1	Not many [of you] should become teachers [serving in an official teaching capacity], my brothers and sisters, for you know that we [who are teachers] will 
JAS.3.2	For we all stumble 
JAS.3.3	Now if we put bits into the horses’ mouths to make them obey us, we guide their whole body as well. 
JAS.3.4	And look at the ships. Even though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are still directed by a very small rudder wherever the impulse of the helmsman determines. 
JAS.3.5	In the same sense, the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it boasts of great things.
JAS.3.6	And the tongue is [in a sense] a fire, the 
JAS.3.7	For every species of beasts and birds, of reptiles and sea creatures, is tamed and has been tamed by the human race. 
JAS.3.8	But no one can tame the 
JAS.3.9	With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God. 
JAS.3.10	Out of the same mouth come 
JAS.3.11	Does a spring send out from the same opening 
JAS.3.12	Can a fig tree, my brothers, produce olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Nor can salt water produce 
JAS.3.13	Who among you is wise and intelligent? Let him by his good conduct show his [good] deeds with the gentleness 
JAS.3.14	But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not be arrogant, and [as a result] be in defiance of the truth. 
JAS.3.15	This [superficial] wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly (secular), natural (unspiritual), 
JAS.3.16	For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder [unrest, rebellion] and every evil thing 
JAS.3.17	But the wisdom from above is first pure [morally and spiritually undefiled], then peace-loving [courteous, considerate], gentle, reasonable [and willing to listen], full of compassion and good fruits. It is unwavering, without [self-righteous] hypocrisy [and self-serving guile]. 
JAS.3.18	And the seed whose fruit is righteousness (spiritual maturity) is sown in peace by those who make peace [by actively encouraging goodwill between individuals].
JAS.4.1	What leads to [the unending] 
JAS.4.2	You are jealous 
JAS.4.3	You ask [God for something] and do not receive it, because you ask 
JAS.4.4	You adulteresses [disloyal sinners—flirting with the world and breaking your vow to God]! Do you not know that being the world’s friend [that is, loving the things of the world] is being God’s enemy? So whoever chooses to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. 
JAS.4.5	Or do you think that the Scripture says to no purpose 
JAS.4.6	But He gives us more and more grace [through the power of the Holy Spirit to defy sin and live an obedient life that reflects both our faith and our gratitude for our salvation]. Therefore, it says, “G
JAS.4.7	So submit to [the authority of] God. Resist the devil [stand firm against him] and he will flee from you. 
JAS.4.8	Come close to God [with a contrite heart] and He will come close to you. Wash your hands, you sinners; and purify your [unfaithful] hearts, you double-minded [people]. 
JAS.4.9	Be miserable and grieve and weep [over your sin]. Let your [foolish] laughter be turned to mourning and your [reckless] joy to gloom. 
JAS.4.10	Humble yourselves [with an attitude of repentance and insignificance] in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you [He will lift you up, He will give you purpose].
JAS.4.11	Believers, do not speak against 
JAS.4.12	There is 
JAS.4.13	Come now [and pay attention to this], you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, and spend a year there and carry on our business and make a profit.” 
JAS.4.14	Yet you do not know [the least thing] 
JAS.4.15	Instead 
JAS.4.16	But as it is, you boast [vainly] in your pretension 
JAS.4.17	So any person who knows what is right to do but does not do it, to him it is sin.
JAS.5.1	Come [quickly] now, you rich [who lack true faith and hoard and misuse your resources], weep and howl over the miseries [the woes, the judgments] that are coming upon you. 
JAS.5.2	Your wealth has rotted 
JAS.5.3	Your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will consume your flesh like fire. You have stored up your treasure in the last days [when it will do you no good]. 
JAS.5.4	Look! The wages that you have [fraudulently] withheld from the laborers who have mowed your fields are crying out [against you for vengeance]; and the cries of the harvesters have come to the ears of 
JAS.5.5	On the earth you have lived luxuriously 
JAS.5.6	You have condemned and have put to death the righteous 
JAS.5.7	So wait patiently, brothers and sisters, until the coming of the Lord. The farmer waits [expectantly] for the precious harvest from the land, being patient about it, until it receives the early and late rains. 
JAS.5.8	You too, be patient; strengthen your hearts [keep them energized and firmly committed to God], because the coming of the Lord is near. 
JAS.5.9	Do not complain against one another, believers, so that you will not be judged [for it]. Look! The Judge is standing 
JAS.5.10	As an example, brothers and sisters, of suffering and patience, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord [as His messengers and representatives]. 
JAS.5.11	You know we call those blessed [happy, spiritually prosperous, favored by God] who were steadfast 
JAS.5.12	But above all, my fellow believers, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath; but let your yes be [a truthful] yes, and your no be [a truthful] no, so that you may not fall under judgment.
JAS.5.13	Is anyone among you suffering? He must pray. Is anyone joyful? He is to sing praises [to God]. 
JAS.5.14	Is anyone among you sick? He must call for the elders (spiritual leaders) of the church and they are to pray over him, anointing him with 
JAS.5.15	and the prayer of faith will restore the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. 
JAS.5.16	Therefore, confess your sins to one another [your false steps, your offenses], and pray for one another, that you may be healed 
JAS.5.17	Elijah was a man with a nature like ours [with the same physical, mental, and spiritual limitations and shortcomings], and he prayed 
JAS.5.18	Then he prayed again, and the sky gave rain and the land produced its crops [as usual].
JAS.5.19	My brothers and sisters, if anyone among you strays from the truth 
JAS.5.20	let the [latter] one know that the one who has turned a sinner from the error of his way will save that one’s soul from death and cover a multitude of sins [that is, obtain the pardon of the many sins committed by the one who has been restored].
1PE.1.1	Peter, an apostle (special messenger, personally chosen representative) of Jesus Christ,
1PE.1.2	according to the foreknowledge of God the Father by the sanctifying work of the Spirit to be obedient to Jesus Christ and to be sprinkled with His blood: May grace and peace [that special sense of spiritual well-being] be yours in increasing abundance [as you walk closely with God].
1PE.1.3	Blessed [gratefully praised and adored] be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His abundant 
1PE.1.4	[born anew] into an inheritance which is imperishable [beyond the reach of change] and undefiled and unfading, reserved in heaven for you, 
1PE.1.5	who are being protected 
1PE.1.6	In this you rejoice greatly, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials, 
1PE.1.7	so that the genuineness of your faith, which is much more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested 
1PE.1.8	Though you have not seen Him, you love Him; and though you do not even see Him now, you believe 
1PE.1.9	receiving as the result [the outcome, the consummation] of your faith, the salvation of 
1PE.1.10	Regarding this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace [of God] that 
1PE.1.11	seeking to find out what person or what time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as He foretold the sufferings of Christ and the glories [destined] to follow. 
1PE.1.12	It was revealed to them that their services [their prophecies regarding grace] were not [meant] for themselves 
1PE.1.13	So prepare your minds for action, be completely sober [in spirit—steadfast, self-disciplined, spiritually and morally alert], fix your hope completely on the grace [of God] that is coming to you when Jesus Christ is revealed. 
1PE.1.14	[Live] as obedient children [of God]; do not be conformed to the evil desires 
1PE.1.15	But like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves in all 
1PE.1.16	because it is written, “Y
1PE.1.17	If you address as Father, the One who impartially judges according to each one’s work, conduct yourselves in [reverent] fear [of Him] 
1PE.1.18	For you know that you were not redeemed from your useless [spiritually unproductive] way of life inherited [by tradition] from your forefathers with perishable things like silver and gold, 
1PE.1.19	but [you were actually purchased] with precious blood, like that of a [sacrificial] lamb unblemished and spotless, 
1PE.1.20	For He was 
1PE.1.21	and through Him you believe [confidently] in God [the heavenly Father], who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are [centered and rest] in God.
1PE.1.22	Since by your obedience to the truth you have purified yourselves for a sincere love of the believers, [see that you] love one another from the heart [always unselfishly seeking the best for one another], 
1PE.1.23	for you have been born again [that is, reborn from above—spiritually transformed, renewed, and set apart for His purpose] not of seed which is perishable but [from that which is] imperishable

1PE.2.1	So put aside every trace of malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander 
1PE.2.2	like newborn babies [you should] long for the pure milk of the word, so that by it you may be nurtured

1PE.2.8	for they stumble because they disobey the word [of God], and to this they [who reject Him as Savior] were also appointed.
1PE.2.9	But you are 
1PE.2.10	Once you were 
1PE.2.11	Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers [in this world] to abstain from the sensual urges [those dishonorable desires] that wage war against the soul. 
1PE.2.12	Keep your behavior excellent among the [unsaved] Gentiles [conduct yourself honorably, with graciousness and integrity], so that 
1PE.2.13	Submit yourselves to [the authority of] every human institution for the sake of the Lord [to honor His name], whether it is to a king as one in a position of power, 
1PE.2.14	or to governors as sent by him to bring punishment to those who do wrong, and to praise 
1PE.2.15	For it is the will of God that by doing right you may silence (muzzle, gag) the [culpable] ignorance 
1PE.2.16	 as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover 
1PE.2.17	Show respect for all people [treat them honorably], love the brotherhood [of believers], fear God, honor the king.
1PE.2.19	For this 
1PE.2.20	After all, what kind of credit is there if, when you do wrong and are punished for it, you endure it patiently? But if when you do what is right and patiently bear [undeserved] suffering, this 
1PE.2.21	For [as a believer] you have been called for this purpose, since Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you may follow in His footsteps. 
1PE.2.22	H
1PE.2.23	While being reviled 
1PE.2.24	He personally carried our sins in His body on the 
1PE.2.25	For you were continually wandering like [so many] sheep, but now you have come back to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.
1PE.3.1	In the same way, you wives, be 
1PE.3.2	when they see your modest and respectful behavior [together with your devotion and appreciation—love your husband, encourage him, and enjoy him as a blessing from God]. 
1PE.3.3	Your adornment must not be 
1PE.3.4	but let it be [the inner beauty of] the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable quality 
1PE.3.5	For in this way in former times the holy women, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves, being submissive to their own husbands 
1PE.3.6	just as Sarah obeyed Abraham [following him and having regard for him as head of their house], calling him 
1PE.3.7	In the same way, you husbands, live with 
1PE.3.8	Finally, all of you be like-minded [united in spirit], sympathetic, brotherly, kindhearted [courteous and compassionate toward each other as members of one household], and humble in spirit; 
1PE.3.9	and never return evil for evil or insult for insult [avoid scolding, berating, and any kind of abuse], but on the contrary, give a blessing [pray for one another’s well-being, contentment, and protection]; for you have been called for this very purpose, that you might inherit a blessing [from God that brings well-being, happiness, and protection]. 
1PE.3.10	For,

1PE.3.13	Now who is there to hurt you if you become enthusiastic for what is good? 
1PE.3.14	But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness [though it is not certain that you will], you are still blessed [happy, to be admired and favored by God]. D
1PE.3.15	But in your hearts set Christ apart [as holy—acknowledging Him, giving Him first place in your lives] as Lord. Always be ready to give a [logical] defense to anyone who asks you to account for the hope 
1PE.3.16	And see to it that your conscience is entirely clear, so that every time you are slandered 
1PE.3.17	For it is better that you suffer [unjustly] for doing what is right, if that should be God’s will, than [to suffer justly] for doing wrong. 
1PE.3.18	For indeed Christ died for sins once for all, the Just 
1PE.3.19	in which He also went and preached to the spirits 
1PE.3.20	who once were disobedient, when the 
1PE.3.21	Corresponding to that [rescue through the flood], baptism [which is an expression of a believer’s new life in Christ] now 
1PE.3.22	who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God [that is, the place of honor and authority], with [all] angels and authorities and powers made subservient to Him.
1PE.4.1	Therefore, since 
1PE.4.2	so that he can no longer spend the rest of his natural life living for human appetites 
1PE.4.3	For the time already past is [more than] enough for doing what the [unsaved] Gentiles like to do—
1PE.4.4	In [connection with] all this, they [the unbelievers] are resentful 
1PE.4.5	But they will [have to] give an account to Him who is ready to judge 
1PE.4.6	For this is why the good news [of salvation] was preached [in their lifetimes] even to those who are dead, that though they were judged in the flesh as men are, they may live in the spirit according to [the will and purpose of] God.
1PE.4.7	The end 
1PE.4.8	Above all, have 
1PE.4.9	Be 
1PE.4.10	Just as each one of you has received a 
1PE.4.11	Whoever speaks [to the congregation], 
1PE.4.12	Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal which is taking place to test you [that is, to test the quality of your faith], as though something strange 
1PE.4.13	But insofar as you are sharing Christ’s sufferings, keep on rejoicing, so that when His glory [filled with His radiance and splendor] is revealed, you may rejoice with great joy. 
1PE.4.14	If you are insulted 
1PE.4.15	Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer, or a thief, or any sort of criminal [in response to persecution], or as a troublesome meddler interfering in the affairs of others; 
1PE.4.16	but if

1PE.4.18	A
1PE.4.19	Therefore, those who are ill-treated 
1PE.5.1	Therefore, I strongly urge the elders among you [pastors, spiritual leaders of the church], as a fellow elder and as an eyewitness [called to testify] of the sufferings of Christ, as well as one who shares in the glory that is to be revealed: 
1PE.5.2	shepherd 
1PE.5.3	not lording it over those assigned to your care [do not be arrogant or overbearing], but be examples [of Christian living] to the flock [set a pattern of integrity for your congregation]. 
1PE.5.4	And when the Chief Shepherd (Christ) appears, you will receive the [conqueror’s] unfading crown of glory. 
1PE.5.5	Likewise, you younger men [of lesser rank and experience], be subject to your elders [seek their counsel]; and all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another [tie on the servant’s apron], for G
1PE.5.6	Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God [set aside self-righteous pride], so that He may exalt you [to a place of honor in His service] at the appropriate time, 
1PE.5.7	casting all your cares [all your anxieties, all your worries, and all your concerns, once and for all] on Him, for He cares about you [with deepest affection, and watches over you very carefully]. 
1PE.5.8	Be sober [well balanced and self-disciplined], be alert 
1PE.5.9	But resist him, be firm in 
1PE.5.10	After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace [who imparts His blessing and favor], who called you to His 
1PE.5.11	To Him be dominion (power, authority, sovereignty) forever and ever. Amen.
1PE.5.12	By 
1PE.5.13	She [the church] who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and 
1PE.5.14	Greet one another with a kiss of love.
2PE.1.2	Grace and peace [that special sense of spiritual well-being] be multiplied to you in the [true, intimate] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. 
2PE.1.3	For His divine power has bestowed on us [absolutely] everything necessary for [a dynamic spiritual] life and godliness, through 
2PE.1.4	For by these He has bestowed on us His precious and magnificent promises [of inexpressible value], so that by them you may escape from the immoral freedom that is in the world because of disreputable desire, and become sharers of the divine nature. 
2PE.1.5	For this very reason, applying your diligence [to the divine promises, make every effort] in [exercising] your faith to, 
2PE.1.6	and in 
2PE.1.7	and in 
2PE.1.8	For as these 
2PE.1.9	For whoever lacks these 
2PE.1.10	Therefore, believers, be all the more diligent to make certain about His calling and choosing you [be sure that your behavior reflects and confirms your relationship with God]; for by 
2PE.1.11	for in this way entry into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be abundantly provided to you.
2PE.1.12	Therefore, I will always be ready to remind you of these things, even though you 
2PE.1.13	I think it right, as long as I am in this 
2PE.1.14	knowing that the laying aside of this 
2PE.1.15	Moreover, I will diligently endeavor [to see to it] that even after my departure you will be able, at all times, to call these things to mind.
2PE.1.16	For we did not follow cleverly devised stories 
2PE.1.17	For when He was invested with honor and [the radiance of the 
2PE.1.18	and we [actually] heard this voice made from heaven when we were together with Him on the holy mountain.
2PE.1.19	So we have the prophetic word made more certain. You do well to pay [close] attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns 
2PE.1.20	But understand this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is 
2PE.1.21	for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.
2PE.2.1	But [in those days] false prophets arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will subtly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing swift destruction on themselves. 
2PE.2.2	Many will follow their shameful ways, and because of them the way of truth will be maligned. 
2PE.2.3	And in 
2PE.2.5	and if He did not spare the ancient world, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, with seven others, when He brought [the judgment of] a flood upon the world of the ungodly; 
2PE.2.6	and if He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction by reducing them to ashes, having made them an example to those who would live ungodly 
2PE.2.7	and if He rescued righteous 
2PE.2.8	(for that just man, while living among them, felt his righteous soul tormented day after day by what he saw and heard of their lawless acts), 
2PE.2.9	then [in light of the fact that all this is true, be sure that] the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trial, and how to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment, 
2PE.2.10	and especially 
2PE.2.11	whereas 
2PE.2.12	But these [false teachers], like unreasoning animals, [mere] creatures of instinct, born to be captured and destroyed, reviling things they do not understand, will also perish in their own corruption [in their destroying they will be destroyed], 
2PE.2.13	suffering wrong [destined for punishment] as the wages of doing wrong. They count it a delight to revel in the daytime [living luxuriously]. They are stains and blemishes [on mankind], reveling in their 
2PE.2.14	They have eyes full of adultery, constantly looking for sin, enticing 
2PE.2.15	Abandoning the straight road [that is, the right way to live], they have gone astray; they have followed the way of [the false teacher] Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the reward of wickedness; 
2PE.2.16	but he was rebuked for his own transgression: a mute donkey spoke with a man’s voice and restrained the prophet’s madness.
2PE.2.17	These [false teachers] are springs without water and mists driven by a tempest, for whom is reserved the gloom of black darkness. 
2PE.2.18	For uttering arrogant 
2PE.2.19	They promise them liberty, when they themselves are the slaves of depravity—for by whatever anyone is defeated 
2PE.2.20	For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the world by [personal] knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and are overcome, their last condition has become worse for them than the first. 
2PE.2.21	For it would have been better for them not to have [personally] known the way of righteousness, than to have known it and then to have turned back from the holy commandment [verbally] handed on to them. 
2PE.2.22	The thing spoken of in the true proverb has happened to them, “T
2PE.3.1	Beloved, I am now writing you this second letter. In this [as in the first one], I am stirring up your untainted mind to remind you, 
2PE.3.2	that you should remember the words spoken in the past [about the future] by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior 
2PE.3.3	First of all, know [without any doubt] that mockers will come in the last days with their mocking, following after their own human desires 
2PE.3.4	and saying, “Where is the promise of His coming [what has become of it]? For ever since the fathers fell asleep [in death], all things have continued [exactly] as they did from the beginning of creation.” 
2PE.3.5	For they willingly forget [the fact] that the heavens existed long ago by the word of God, and the earth was formed 
2PE.3.6	through which the world at that time was destroyed by being flooded with water. 
2PE.3.7	But by His word the present heavens and earth are being reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly people.
2PE.3.8	Nevertheless, do not let this one 
2PE.3.9	The Lord does not delay [as though He were unable to act] 
2PE.3.10	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will vanish with a [mighty and thunderous] roar, and the [material] elements will be destroyed with intense heat, and the earth and the works that are on it will be 
2PE.3.11	Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be [in the meantime] in holy behavior [that is, in a pattern of daily life that sets you apart as a believer] and in godliness [displaying profound reverence toward our awesome God], 
2PE.3.12	[while you earnestly] look for and await the coming of the day of God. For on this day the heavens will be destroyed by burning, and the [material] elements will melt with intense heat! 
2PE.3.13	But in accordance with His promise we expectantly await new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.
2PE.3.14	So, beloved, since you are looking forward to these things, be diligent 
2PE.3.15	And consider the patience of our Lord [His delay in judging and avenging wrongs] as salvation [that is, allowing time for more to be saved]; just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given to him [by God], 
2PE.3.16	speaking about these things as he does in all of his letters. In which there are some things that are difficult to understand, which the untaught and unstable [who have fallen into error] twist 
2PE.3.17	Therefore, [let me warn you] beloved, knowing these things beforehand, be on your guard so that you are not carried away by the error of 
2PE.3.18	but grow [spiritually mature] in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be glory (honor, majesty, splendor), both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.
1JN.1.1	[I am writing about] what existed from the beginning, what 
1JN.1.2	and the Life [an aspect of His being] was manifested, and we have seen [it as eyewitnesses] and testify and declare to you [the Life], the eternal Life who was [already existing] with the Father and was [actually] made visible to us [His followers]— 
1JN.1.3	what we have seen and heard we also proclaim to you, so that you too may have fellowship [as partners] with us. And indeed our fellowship [which is a distinguishing mark of born-again believers] is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ. 
1JN.1.4	We are writing these things to you so that our joy [in seeing you included] may be made complete [by having you share in the joy of salvation].
1JN.1.5	This is the message [of God’s promised revelation] which we have heard from Him and now announce to you, that God is Light [He is holy, His message is truthful, He is perfect in righteousness], and in Him there is no darkness at all [no sin, no wickedness, no imperfection]. 
1JN.1.6	If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness [of sin], we lie and do not practice the truth; 
1JN.1.7	but if we [really] walk in the Light [that is, live each and every day in conformity with the precepts of God], as He Himself is in the Light, we have [true, unbroken] fellowship with one another [He with us, and we with Him], and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin [by erasing the stain of sin, keeping us cleansed from sin in all its forms and manifestations]. 
1JN.1.8	If we say we have no sin [refusing to admit that we are sinners], we delude ourselves and the truth is not in us. [His word does not live in our hearts.] 
1JN.1.9	If we [freely] admit that we have sinned 
1JN.1.10	If we say that we have not sinned [refusing to admit acts of sin], we make Him [out to be] a liar [by contradicting Him] and His word is not in us.
1JN.2.1	My little children (believers, dear ones), I am writing you these things so that you will not sin 
1JN.2.2	And He [that same Jesus] is the propitiation for our sins [the atoning sacrifice that holds back the wrath of God that would otherwise be directed at us because of our sinful nature—our worldliness, our lifestyle]; and not for ours alone, but also for [the sins of all believers throughout] the whole world.
1JN.2.3	And this is how we know [daily, by experience] that we have come to know Him [to understand Him and be more deeply acquainted with Him]: if we 
1JN.2.4	Whoever says, “I have come to know Him,” but does not 
1JN.2.5	But whoever 
1JN.2.6	whoever says he lives in Christ [that is, whoever says he has accepted Him as God and Savior] ought [as a moral obligation] to walk 
1JN.2.7	Beloved, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the message which you have heard [before from us]. 
1JN.2.8	On the other hand, I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true 
1JN.2.9	The one who says he is in the Light [in consistent fellowship with Christ] and yet 
1JN.2.10	The one who 
1JN.2.11	But the one who 
1JN.2.12	I am writing to you, little children (believers, dear ones), because your sins have been forgiven for His name’s sake [you have been pardoned and released from spiritual debt through His name because you have confessed His name, believing in Him as Savior]. 
1JN.2.13	I am writing to you, fathers [those believers who are spiritually mature], because you know Him who has existed from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men [those believers who are growing in spiritual maturity], because you have been victorious 
1JN.2.14	I have written to you, fathers, because you know Him who has existed from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong 
1JN.2.15	Do not love the world [of sin that opposes God and His precepts], nor the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 
1JN.2.16	For all that is in the world—the lust 
1JN.2.17	The world is passing away, and with it its lusts [the shameful pursuits and ungodly longings]; but the one who does the will of God 
1JN.2.18	Children, it is the last hour [the end of this age]; and just as you heard that the antichrist is coming [the one who will oppose Christ and attempt to replace Him], even now many antichrists (false teachers) have appeared, which confirms our belief that it is the last hour. 
1JN.2.19	They went out from us [seeming at first to be Christians], but they were not 
1JN.2.20	But you have an anointing from the Holy One [you have been set apart, specially gifted and prepared by the Holy Spirit], and all of you know [the truth because He teaches us, illuminates our minds, and guards us from error]. 
1JN.2.21	I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie [nothing false, no deception] is of the truth. 
1JN.2.22	Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed)? This is the antichrist [the enemy and antagonist of Christ], the one who denies 
1JN.2.23	Whoever denies 
1JN.2.24	As for you, let that remain in you [keeping in your hearts that message of salvation] which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning remains in you, you too will remain in the Son and in the Father [forever].
1JN.2.25	This is the promise which He Himself promised us—eternal life.
1JN.2.26	These things I have written to you with reference to those who are trying to deceive you [seducing you and leading you away from the truth and sound doctrine]. 
1JN.2.27	As for you, the anointing [the special gift, the preparation] which you received from Him remains [permanently] in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you. But just as His anointing teaches you [giving you insight through the presence of the Holy Spirit] about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as His anointing has taught you, 
1JN.2.28	Now, little children (believers, dear ones), remain in Him [with unwavering faith], so that when He appears [at His return], we may have [perfect] confidence and not be ashamed and shrink away from Him at His coming. 
1JN.2.29	If you know that He is 
1JN.3.1	See what an incredible quality of love the Father has shown to us, that we would [be permitted to] be named 
1JN.3.2	Beloved, we are [even here and] now children of God, and it is not yet made clear what we will be [after His coming]. We know that when He comes 
1JN.3.3	And everyone who has this hope [confidently placed] in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure (holy, undefiled, guiltless).
1JN.3.4	Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness [ignoring God’s law by action or neglect or by tolerating wrongdoing—being unrestrained by His commands and His will]. 
1JN.3.5	You know that He appeared [in visible form as a man] in order to take away sins; and in Him there is [absolutely] no sin [for He has neither the sin nature nor has He committed sin or acts worthy of blame]. 
1JN.3.6	No one who abides in Him [who remains united in fellowship with Him—deliberately, knowingly, and habitually] practices sin. No one who 
1JN.3.7	Little children (believers, dear ones), do not let anyone lead you astray. The one who practices righteousness [the one who strives to live a consistently honorable life—in private as well as in public—and to conform to God’s precepts] is righteous, just as He is righteous. 
1JN.3.8	The one who practices sin [separating himself from God, and offending Him by acts of disobedience, indifference, or rebellion] is of the devil [and takes his inner character and moral values from him, not God]; for the devil has sinned 
1JN.3.9	No one who is born of God [deliberately, knowingly, and habitually] practices sin, because 
1JN.3.10	By this the children of God and the children of the devil are clearly identified: anyone who does not practice righteousness [who does not seek God’s will in thought, action, and purpose] is not of God, nor is the one who does not [unselfishly] 
1JN.3.11	For this is the message which you [believers] have heard from the beginning [of your relationship with Christ], that we should [unselfishly] love 
1JN.3.12	and not be like Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother [Abel]. And why did he murder him? Because Cain’s deeds were evil, and his brother’s were righteous.
1JN.3.13	Do not be surprised, believers, if the world hates you. 
1JN.3.14	We know that we have passed out of death into Life, because we love the brothers and sisters. He who does not love remains in [spiritual] death. 
1JN.3.15	Everyone who hates (works against) his brother [in Christ] is [at heart] a murderer [by God’s standards]; and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. 
1JN.3.16	By this we know [and have come to understand the depth and essence of His precious] love: that He [willingly] laid down His life for us [because He loved us]. And we ought to lay down our lives for the believers. 
1JN.3.17	But whoever has the 
1JN.3.18	Little children (believers, dear ones), let us not love [merely in theory] with word or with tongue [giving lip service to compassion], but in action and in truth [in practice and in sincerity, because practical acts of love are more than words]. 
1JN.3.19	By this we will know [without any doubt] that we are of the truth, and will assure our heart 
1JN.3.20	whenever our heart convicts us [in guilt]; for God is greater than our heart and He knows all things [nothing is hidden from Him because we are in His hands]. 
1JN.3.21	Beloved, if our heart does not convict us [of guilt], we have confidence [complete assurance and boldness] before God; 
1JN.3.22	and we receive from Him whatever we ask because we [carefully and consistently] keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight [habitually seeking to follow His plan for us].
1JN.3.23	This is His commandment, that we believe [with personal faith and confident trust] in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and [that we unselfishly] love 
1JN.3.24	The one who 
1JN.4.1	Beloved, do not believe every spirit [speaking through a self-proclaimed prophet]; instead test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets 
1JN.4.2	By this you know 
1JN.4.3	and every spirit that does not confess Jesus [acknowledging that He has come in the flesh, but would deny any of the Son’s true nature] is not of God; this is the 
1JN.4.4	Little children (believers, dear ones), you are of God 
1JN.4.5	They [who teach twisted doctrine] are of the world 
1JN.4.6	We [who teach God’s word] are from God [energized by the Holy Spirit], and whoever knows God [through personal experience] listens to us [and has a deeper understanding of Him]. Whoever is not of God does not listen to us. By this we know [without any doubt] the spirit of truth [motivated by God] and the spirit of error [motivated by Satan].
1JN.4.7	Beloved, let us [unselfishly] 
1JN.4.8	The one who does not love has not become acquainted with God [does not and never did know Him], for God is love. [He is the originator of love, and it is an enduring attribute of His nature.] 
1JN.4.9	By this the love of God was displayed in us, in that God has sent His [One and] only begotten Son [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind] into the world so that we might live through Him. 
1JN.4.10	In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation [that is, the atoning sacrifice, and the satisfying offering] for our sins [fulfilling God’s requirement for justice against sin and placating His wrath]. 
1JN.4.11	Beloved, if God so loved us [in this incredible way], we also ought to love one another. 
1JN.4.12	No one has seen God at any time. But if we love one another [with unselfish concern], God abides in us, and His love [the love that is His essence abides in us and] is completed 
1JN.4.13	By this we know [with confident assurance] that we abide in Him and He in us, because He has given to us His [Holy] Spirit. 
1JN.4.14	We [who were with Him in person] have seen and testify [as eye-witnesses] that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.
1JN.4.15	Whoever confesses 
1JN.4.16	We have come to know [by personal observation and experience], and have believed [with deep, consistent faith] the love which God has for us. God is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God abides 
1JN.4.17	In this [union and fellowship with Him], love is completed 
1JN.4.18	There is no fear in love [dread does not exist]. But perfect (complete, full-grown) love drives out fear, because fear involves [the expectation of divine] punishment, so the one who is afraid [of God’s judgment] is not perfected in love [has not grown into a sufficient understanding of God’s love]. 
1JN.4.19	We love, because 
1JN.4.20	If anyone says, “I love God,” and hates (works against) his [Christian] brother he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen. 
1JN.4.21	And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God should also [unselfishly] love his brother 
1JN.5.1	Everyone who believes [with a deep, abiding trust in the fact] that Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed) is born of God [that is, reborn from above—spiritually transformed, renewed, and set apart for His purpose], and everyone who loves the Father also loves 
1JN.5.2	By this we know [without any doubt] that we love the children of God: [expressing that love] when we love God and obey His commandments. 
1JN.5.3	For the [true] love of God is this: that we 
1JN.5.4	For 
1JN.5.5	Who is the one who is victorious 
1JN.5.6	This is He who came through water and blood [His baptism and death], Jesus Christ—not by the water only, but by the water and the blood. It is the [Holy] Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. [He is the essence and origin of truth itself.] 
1JN.5.7	For there are three witnesses: 
1JN.5.8	the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three are in agreement [their testimony is perfectly consistent]. 
1JN.5.9	If we accept [as we do] the testimony of men [that is, if we are willing to take the sworn statements of fallible humans as evidence], the testimony of God is greater [far more authoritative]; for this is the testimony of God, that He has testified regarding His Son. 
1JN.5.10	The one who believes in the Son of God [who adheres to, trusts in, and relies confidently on Him as Savior] has the testimony within himself [because he can speak authoritatively about Christ from his own personal experience]. The one who does not believe God [in this way] has made Him [out to be] a liar, because he has not believed in the evidence that God has given regarding His Son. 
1JN.5.11	And the testimony is this: God has given us eternal life [we already possess it], and this life is in His Son [resulting in our spiritual completeness, and eternal companionship with Him]. 
1JN.5.12	He who has the Son [by accepting Him as Lord and Savior] has the life [that is eternal]; he who does not have the Son of God [by personal faith] does not have the life.
1JN.5.13	These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God [which represents all that Jesus Christ is and does], so that you will know [with settled and absolute knowledge] that you [already] have eternal life. 
1JN.5.14	This is the [remarkable degree of] confidence which we [as believers are entitled to] have before Him: that 
1JN.5.15	And if we know [for a fact, as indeed we do] that He hears 
1JN.5.16	If anyone sees his brother committing a sin that does not 
1JN.5.17	All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin that does not 
1JN.5.18	We know [with confidence] that anyone born of God does not 
1JN.5.19	We know [for a fact] that we are of God, and the whole world [around us] lies in the power of the evil one [opposing God and His precepts]. 
1JN.5.20	And we [have seen and] know [by personal experience] that the Son of God has [actually] come [to this world], and has given us understanding 
1JN.5.21	Little children (believers, dear ones), guard yourselves from idols—[false teachings, moral compromises, and anything that would take God’s place in your heart].
2JN.1.1	The elder [of the church addresses this letter] to the elect (chosen) 
2JN.1.2	because of the truth which lives in our hearts and will be with us forever: 
2JN.1.3	Grace, mercy, and peace (inner calm, a sense of spiritual well-being) will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father’s Son, in truth and love.
2JN.1.4	I was greatly delighted to find 
2JN.1.5	Now I ask you, lady, not as if 
2JN.1.6	And this is love: that we walk in accordance with His commandments 
2JN.1.7	For many deceivers [heretics, posing as Christians] have gone out into the world, those who do not acknowledge 
2JN.1.8	Watch yourselves, so that you do not lose what we have accomplished together, but that you may receive a full 
2JN.1.9	Anyone who runs on ahead and does not remain in the doctrine of Christ [that is, one who is not content with what He taught], does not have God; but the one who 
2JN.1.10	If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching [but diminishes or adds to the doctrine of Christ], do not receive 
2JN.1.11	for the one who gives him a greeting [who encourages him or wishes him success, unwittingly] participates in his evil deeds. 
2JN.1.12	I have many things to write to you, but I prefer not to do so with paper (papyrus) and black (ink); but I hope to come to you and speak with you 
2JN.1.13	The children of your elect (chosen) sister greet you.
3JN.1.1	The elder [of the church addresses this letter] to the beloved 
3JN.1.2	Beloved, I pray that in every way you may succeed 
3JN.1.3	For I was greatly pleased when [some of the] brothers came [from time to time] and testified to your [faithfulness to the] truth [of the gospel message], 
3JN.1.4	I have no greater joy than this, to hear that my [spiritual] children are living [their lives] in the truth.
3JN.1.5	Beloved, you are acting faithfully in what you are providing for the brothers, and especially 
3JN.1.6	and they have testified before the church of your love 
3JN.1.7	For these [traveling missionaries] went out for the sake of the Name [of Christ], accepting nothing [in the way of assistance] from the Gentiles. 
3JN.1.8	So we ought to support such people [welcoming them as guests and providing for them], so that we may be fellow workers for the truth [that is, for the gospel message of salvation].
3JN.1.9	I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to put himself first, does not accept what we say 
3JN.1.10	For this reason, if I come, I will call attention to what he is doing, unjustly accusing us with wicked words 
3JN.1.11	Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but [imitate] what is good. The one who practices good [exhibiting godly character, moral courage and personal integrity] is of God; the one who practices [or permits or tolerates] evil has not seen God [he has no personal experience with Him and does not know Him at all]. 
3JN.1.12	Demetrius has received a 
3JN.1.13	I had many things [to say when I began] to write to you, but I prefer not to put it down with pen (reed) and 
3JN.1.14	but I hope to see you soon, and we will speak 
3JN.1.15	Peace be to you. The friends [here] greet you. Greet the friends [personally] by name.
JUD.1.1	Jude, a bond-servant of Jesus Christ, and 
JUD.1.2	May mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you [filling your heart with the spiritual well-being and serenity experienced by those who walk closely with God].
JUD.1.3	Beloved, while I was making every effort to write you about our common salvation, I was compelled to write to you [urgently] appealing that you 
JUD.1.4	For certain people have crept in unnoticed [just as if they were sneaking in by a side door]. They are ungodly persons whose condemnation was predicted long ago, for they distort the grace of our God into decadence 
JUD.1.5	Now I want to remind you, although you are fully informed once for all, that 
JUD.1.6	And angels who did not keep their own designated place of power, but abandoned their proper dwelling place, [these] He has kept in eternal chains under [the thick gloom of utter] darkness for the judgment of the great day, 
JUD.1.7	just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the adjacent cities, since they in the same way as these 
JUD.1.8	Nevertheless in the same way, these dreamers [who are dreaming that God will not punish them] also defile the body, and reject [legitimate] authority, and revile 
JUD.1.9	But even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil (Satan), and 
JUD.1.10	But these men sneer at anything which they do not understand; and whatever they do know by [mere] instinct, like unreasoning 
JUD.1.11	Woe to them! For they have gone the [defiant] way of Cain, and for profit they have run headlong into the error of Balaam, and perished in the rebellion of [mutinous] Korah. 
JUD.1.12	These men are hidden reefs [elements of great danger to others] in your 
JUD.1.13	wild waves of the sea, flinging up their own shame like foam; wandering stars, for whom the gloom of deep darkness has been reserved forever.
JUD.1.14	It was about these people that 
JUD.1.15	to execute judgment upon all, and to convict all the 
JUD.1.16	These 
JUD.1.17	But as for you, beloved, remember the [prophetic] words spoken by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
JUD.1.18	They used to say to you, “In the last days there will be scoffers, following after their own ungodly passions.” 
JUD.1.19	These are the ones who are [agitators] causing divisions—worldly-minded [secular, unspiritual, carnal, merely sensual—unsaved], devoid of the Spirit. 
JUD.1.20	But you, beloved, build yourselves up on [the foundation of] your most holy faith [continually progress, rise like an edifice higher and higher], pray in the Holy Spirit, 
JUD.1.21	and keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting anxiously 
JUD.1.22	And have mercy on some, who are doubting; 
JUD.1.23	save others, snatching them out of the fire; and on some have mercy but with fear, loathing even the clothing spotted 
JUD.1.24	Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling 
JUD.1.25	to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and power, before all time and now and forever. Amen.
REV.1.2	who testified 
REV.1.3	Blessed (happy, prosperous, to be admired) is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and who keep the things which are written in it [heeding them and taking them to heart]; for the time [of fulfillment] is near.

REV.1.10	I was in the 
REV.1.11	saying, 
REV.1.12	Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me. And after turning I saw seven golden lampstands; 
REV.1.13	and in the midst of the lampstands 
REV.1.14	His head and His hair were white like white wool, [glistening white] like snow; and His [all-seeing] eyes were [flashing] like a flame of fire [piercing into my being]. 
REV.1.15	His feet were like burnished [white-hot] bronze, refined in a furnace, and His voice was [powerful] like the sound of many waters. 
REV.1.16	In His right hand He held seven stars, and from His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword [of judgment]; and His face [reflecting His majesty and the 
REV.1.17	When I saw Him, I fell at His feet as though dead. And He placed His right hand on me and said,

REV.3.20	 [of the church] 
REV.3.21	 [the world through believing that Jesus is the Son of God], 
REV.4.1	After this I looked, and behold, 
REV.4.2	At once I was in [special communication with] the Spirit; and behold, a throne stood in heaven, with One seated on the throne. 
REV.4.3	And He who sat there appeared like [the crystalline sparkle of] 
REV.4.4	Twenty-four [other] thrones surrounded the throne; and seated on these thrones were 
REV.4.5	From the throne came flashes of lightning and [rumbling] sounds and peals of thunder. Seven lamps of fire were burning in front of the throne, which are 
REV.4.6	and in front of the throne 
REV.4.7	The first living creature was like a lion, the second creature like a calf (ox), the third creature had the face of a man, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle. 
REV.4.8	And the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes all over and within [underneath their wings]; and day and night they never stop saying,
REV.4.8	“H
REV.4.9	Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanksgiving to Him who sits on the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever, 
REV.4.10	the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne, and they worship Him who lives forever and ever; and they throw down their crowns before the throne, saying,
REV.4.11	“Worthy are You, our Lord and God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power; for You created all things, and because of Your will they exist, and were created 
REV.5.1	I saw in the right hand of Him who was seated on the throne a scroll written on the inside and on the back, closed 
REV.5.2	And I saw a strong angel announcing with a loud voice, “Who is worthy [having the authority and virtue] to open the scroll and to 
REV.5.3	And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth [in Hades, the realm of the dead] was able to open the scroll or look into it. 
REV.5.4	And I 
REV.5.5	Then one of the [twenty-four] elders said to me, “Stop weeping! Look closely, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome 
REV.5.6	And there 
REV.5.7	And He came and 
REV.5.8	And when He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb (Christ), each one holding a harp and golden bowls full of fragrant incense, which are the prayers of the saints (God’s people). 
REV.5.9	And they sang a new song [of glorious redemption], saying,
REV.5.9	“Worthy 
REV.5.10	You have made them to be a kingdom [of royal subjects] and priests to our God; and they will reign on the earth.”
REV.5.11	Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and [the voice] of the living creatures and the elders; and they numbered myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands (innumerable), 
REV.5.12	saying in a loud voice,
REV.5.12	“Worthy 
REV.5.13	And I heard every created thing that is in heaven or on earth or under the earth [in Hades, the realm of the dead] or on the sea, and everything that is in them, saying [together],
REV.5.13	“To Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb (Christ), be blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever.”
REV.5.14	And the four living creatures kept saying, “Amen.” And the elders fell down and worshiped [Him who lives forever and ever].
REV.6.1	Then I saw as the Lamb (Christ) broke one of the seven 
REV.6.2	I looked, and behold, a 
REV.6.3	When He (the Lamb) broke the second seal, I heard the second living creature call out, “Come.” 
REV.6.4	And another, a 
REV.6.5	When He (the Lamb) broke open the third seal, I heard the third living creature call out, “Come.” I looked, and behold, a black horse [of famine]; and the rider had in his hand a pair of scales (a balance). 
REV.6.6	And I heard 
REV.6.7	When He (the Lamb) broke open the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature call out, “Come.” 
REV.6.8	So I looked, and behold, an ashen (pale greenish gray) horse [like a corpse, representing death and pestilence]; and its rider’s name was Death; and Hades (the realm of the dead) was following with him. They were given authority 
REV.6.9	When He (the Lamb) broke open the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slaughtered because of the word of God, and because of the testimony which they had maintained [out of loyalty to Christ]. 
REV.6.10	They cried in a loud voice, saying, “O Lord, holy and true, how long now before You will sit in judgment and avenge our blood on those [unregenerate ones] who dwell on the earth?” 
REV.6.11	Then they were each given a white robe; and they were told to rest 
REV.6.12	I looked when He (the Lamb) broke open the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as 
REV.6.13	and the stars of the sky fell to the earth, like a fig tree shedding its late [summer] figs when shaken by a strong wind. 
REV.6.14	The sky was split [separated from the land] and rolled up like a scroll, and every mountain and island were dislodged 
REV.6.15	Then the kings of the earth and the great men and the 
REV.6.16	and they called to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits on the throne, and from the [righteous] wrath 
REV.6.17	for the great day of their wrath 
REV.7.1	After this I saw four angels stationed at the four corners of the earth, holding back the 
REV.7.2	Then I saw another angel coming up from the rising of the sun, holding the seal of the living God; and with a loud voice he called out to the four angels to whom it was granted [to have authority and power] to harm the earth and the sea, 
REV.7.3	saying, “Do not harm the earth nor the sea nor the trees until we 
REV.7.4	And I heard how many were sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand; [twelve thousand] sealed from 
REV.7.5	Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand from the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand from the tribe of Gad,
REV.7.6	twelve thousand from the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand from the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand from the tribe of Manasseh,
REV.7.7	twelve thousand from the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand from the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand from the tribe of Issachar,
REV.7.8	twelve thousand from the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand from the tribe of Joseph, and twelve thousand from the tribe of Benjamin were sealed (marked, redeemed, protected).
REV.7.9	After these things I looked, and this is what I saw: a vast multitude which no one could count, [gathered] from every nation and from all the tribes and peoples and languages [of the earth], standing before the throne and before the Lamb (Christ), dressed in white robes, with 
REV.7.10	and in a loud voice they cried out, saying,
REV.7.10	“
REV.7.11	And all the angels were standing around the throne and 
REV.7.12	saying,
REV.7.12	“
REV.7.13	Then one of the elders responded, saying to me, “These who are dressed in the long white robes—who are they, and from where did they come?” 
REV.7.14	I said to him, “My lord, you know [the answer].” And he said to me, “These are the people who come out of the great tribulation (persecution), and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb [because of His atoning sacrifice]. 
REV.7.15	For this reason, they are [standing] before the throne of God; and they serve Him [in worship] day and night in His temple; and He who sits on the throne will 
REV.7.16	They will hunger no longer, nor thirst anymore; nor will the sun 
REV.7.17	for the Lamb who is in the center of the throne will be their Shepherd, and He will guide them to springs of the waters of life; and God will wipe every tear from their eyes [giving them eternal comfort].”
REV.8.1	When He (the Lamb) broke open the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour [in awe of God’s impending judgment]. 
REV.8.2	Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven 
REV.8.3	Another angel came and stood at the altar. He had a golden 
REV.8.4	And the smoke 
REV.8.5	So the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it to the earth; and there were peals of thunder 
REV.8.6	Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them [initiating the judgments].
REV.8.7	The first [angel] sounded [his trumpet], and there was [a storm of] hail and fire, mixed with blood, and it was hurled to the earth; and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.
REV.8.8	The second angel sounded [his trumpet], and 
REV.8.9	and a third of the living creatures that were in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
REV.8.10	The third angel sounded [his trumpet], and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch [flashing across the sky], and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of [fresh] waters. 
REV.8.11	The name of the star is 
REV.8.12	Then the fourth angel sounded [his trumpet], and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were struck, so that a third of them would be darkened and a third of the daylight would not shine, and the night in the same way [would not shine].
REV.8.13	Then I looked, and I heard a solitary eagle flying in 
REV.9.1	Then the fifth angel sounded [his trumpet], and I saw a star (angelic being) that had fallen from heaven to the earth; and the key of the bottomless pit (abyss) was given to him (the star-angel). 
REV.9.2	He opened the bottomless pit, and smoke like the smoke of a great furnace flowed out of the pit; and the sun and the atmosphere were darkened by the smoke from the pit. 
REV.9.3	Then out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth, and power [to hurt] was given to them, like the power which the earth’s scorpions have. 
REV.9.4	They were told not to hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but [to hurt] only the people who do not have the seal (mark of ownership, protection) of God on their foreheads. 
REV.9.5	They were not permitted to kill anyone, but to torment 
REV.9.6	And in those days people will seek death and will not find it; and they will long to die [to escape the pain], but [will discover that] death evades them.
REV.9.7	The locusts resembled horses prepared 
REV.9.8	They had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like 
REV.9.9	They had breastplates (scales) like breastplates made of iron; and the [whirring] noise of their wings was like the [thunderous] noise of countless horse-drawn chariots charging [at full speed] into battle. 
REV.9.10	They have tails like scorpions, and stingers; and in their tails is their power to hurt people for five months. 
REV.9.11	They have as king over them, the angel of the abyss (the bottomless pit); in Hebrew his name is Abaddon (destruction), and in Greek he is called Apollyon (destroyer-king).
REV.9.12	The first woe has passed; behold, two woes are still coming after these things.
REV.9.13	Then the sixth angel sounded [his trumpet], and I heard a solitary voice from the four horns of the golden altar which stands before God, 
REV.9.14	saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.” 
REV.9.15	So the four angels, who had been prepared for the [appointed] hour and day and month and year, were released to kill a third of mankind. 
REV.9.16	The number of the troops of cavalry was twice ten thousand times ten thousand (two hundred million); I heard the number of them. 
REV.9.17	And this is how I saw the horses and their riders in my vision: 
REV.9.18	A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues—by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone that came from the mouths of the horses. 
REV.9.19	For the power of the horses [to do harm] is in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents and have heads, and it is with them that they do harm.
REV.9.20	The rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, 
REV.9.21	and they did not repent of their murders nor of their sorceries (drugs, intoxications) nor of their [sexual] immorality nor of their thefts.
REV.10.1	Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, clothed in a cloud, with a rainbow (halo) over his head; and his face was like the sun, and his feet (legs) were like columns of fire; 
REV.10.2	and he had a little book (scroll) open in his hand. He set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land; 
REV.10.3	and he shouted with a loud voice, like the roaring of a lion [compelling attention and inspiring awe]; and when he had shouted out, the seven peals of thunder spoke with their own voices [uttering their message in distinct words]. 
REV.10.4	And when the seven peals of thunder had spoken, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Seal up the things which the seven peals of thunder have spoken and do not write them down.” 
REV.10.5	Then the angel whom I had seen standing on the sea and the land raised his right hand [to swear an oath] to heaven, 
REV.10.6	and swore [an oath] by [the name of] Him who lives forever and ever, 
REV.10.7	but 
REV.10.8	Then the voice which I heard from heaven, 
REV.10.9	So I went up to the angel and told him to give me the little book. And he said to me, “Take it and eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.” 
REV.10.10	So I took the little book from the angel’s hand and ate it, and in my mouth it was as sweet as honey; but once I had swallowed it, my stomach was 
REV.10.11	Then they said to me, “You must prophesy again concerning many peoples and nations and languages and kings.”
REV.11.1	Then there was given to me a 
REV.11.2	But leave out the court [of the Gentiles] which is outside the temple and do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles (the nations); and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months (three and one-half years). 
REV.11.3	And I will grant 
REV.11.4	These [witnesses] are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which stand before the Lord of the earth. 
REV.11.5	And if anyone wants to harm them, fire comes out of their mouth and devours their enemies; so if anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this way. 
REV.11.6	These [two witnesses] have the power [from God] to shut up the sky, so that no rain will fall during the days of their prophesying [regarding judgment and salvation]; and they have power over the waters (seas, rivers) to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every [kind of] plague, as often as they wish.
REV.11.7	When they have finished their testimony 
REV.11.8	And their dead bodies 
REV.11.9	Those from the peoples and tribes and languages and nations 
REV.11.10	And those [non-believers] who live on the earth will gloat over them and rejoice; and they will send gifts [in celebration] to one another, because these two prophets tormented 
REV.11.11	But after three and a half days, the breath of life from God came into them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear 
REV.11.12	And the two witnesses heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here.” Then they ascended into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies watched them. 
REV.11.13	And in that [very] hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell 
REV.11.14	The second woe is past; behold, the third woe is coming quickly.
REV.11.15	Then the seventh angel sounded [his trumpet]; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying,
REV.11.15	“
REV.11.16	And the twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God, fell face downward and worshiped God, 
REV.11.17	saying,
REV.11.17	“
REV.11.18	And the nations (Gentiles) became enraged, and Your wrath 
REV.11.19	And the temple of God which is in heaven was opened; and the ark of His covenant appeared in His temple, and there were flashes of lightning, loud rumblings and peals of thunder and an earthquake and a great hailstorm.
REV.12.1	And a great sign [warning of an ominous and frightening future event] appeared in heaven: a 
REV.12.2	She was with child (the Messiah) and she cried out, being in labor and in pain to give birth.
REV.12.3	Then another sign [of warning] was seen in heaven: behold, a great fiery red dragon (Satan) with 
REV.12.4	And his tail swept [across the sky] 
REV.12.5	And she gave birth to a Son, a male 
REV.12.6	Then the woman fled into the wilderness where she had a place prepared by God, so that she would be nourished there for a thousand two hundred and sixty days (forty-two months; three and one-half years).
REV.12.7	And war broke out in heaven, Michael [the archangel] and his angels waging war with the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought, 
REV.12.8	but they were not strong enough 
REV.12.9	And the great dragon was thrown down, the age-old serpent who is called the 
REV.12.10	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying,
REV.12.10	“
REV.12.11	And they overcame 
REV.12.12	Therefore rejoice, O heavens and you who dwell in them [in the presence of God]. Woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has come down to you in great wrath, knowing that he has 
REV.12.13	And when the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who had given birth to the male 
REV.12.14	But the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, so that she could fly into the wilderness to her place, where she was nourished for a time and times and half a time (three and one-half years), away from the presence of the serpent (Satan). 
REV.12.15	And the serpent hurled water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, so that he might cause her to be swept away with the flood. 
REV.12.16	But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon had hurled out of his mouth. 
REV.12.17	So the dragon was enraged with the woman, and he went off to wage war on the rest of her children (seed), those who keep 
REV.13.1	And the 
REV.13.2	And the beast that I saw resembled a 
REV.13.3	 one of his heads which seemed to have a fatal wound, but his fatal wound was healed; and the entire earth 
REV.13.4	They fell down 
REV.13.5	And the beast was given a mouth (the power of speech), uttering great things 
REV.13.6	And he opened his mouth to speak blasphemies (abusive speech, slander) against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, and those who live in heaven.
REV.13.7	He was also 
REV.13.8	All the inhabitants of the earth will fall down 
REV.13.9	If anyone has an ear, let him hear. 
REV.13.10	If anyone 
REV.13.11	Then I saw 
REV.13.12	He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence [when the two are together]. And he makes the earth and those who inhabit it worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. 
REV.13.13	He performs great signs (awe-inspiring acts), even making fire fall from the sky to the earth, right before peoples’ eyes. 
REV.13.14	And he deceives those [unconverted ones] who inhabit the earth [into believing him] because of the signs which he is given [by Satan] to perform in the presence of the [first] beast, telling those who inhabit the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded [fatally] by the sword and has come back to life. 
REV.13.15	And he is given power to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast will even [appear to] speak, and cause those who do not bow down 
REV.13.16	Also he compels all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free men and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead [signifying allegiance to the beast], 
REV.13.17	and that no one will be able to buy or sell, except the one who has the mark, 
REV.13.18	Here is wisdom. Let the person who has enough insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the [imperfect] number of a man; 
REV.14.1	Then I looked, and this is what I saw: the Lamb stood [firmly established] on Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand who had His name and His Father’s name inscribed on their foreheads [signifying God’s own possession]. 
REV.14.2	And I heard a voice from heaven, like the sound of great waters and like the rumbling of mighty thunder; and the voice that I heard [seemed like music and] was like 
REV.14.3	And they sang a new song before the throne [of God] and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one could learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been purchased (ransomed, redeemed) from the earth. 
REV.14.4	These are the ones who have not been defiled [by relations] with women, for they are celibate. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These have been purchased 
REV.14.5	No lie was found in their mouth, for they are blameless (spotless, untainted, beyond reproach).
REV.14.6	Then I saw another angel flying in midheaven, with an 
REV.14.7	and he said with a loud voice, “Fear God [with awe and reverence], and give Him glory [and honor and praise in worship], because the hour of His judgment has come; [with all your heart] worship Him who created the heaven and the earth, the sea and the springs of water.”
REV.14.8	Then another angel, a second one, followed, saying, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who has made all nations drink the wine of the passion of her immorality [corrupting them with idolatry].”
REV.14.9	Then another angel, a third one, followed them, saying with a loud voice, “Whoever worships the beast and his image and receives the mark [of the beast] on his forehead or on his hand, 
REV.14.10	he too will [have to] drink of the wine of the wrath of God, 
REV.14.11	And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day and night—those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.” 
REV.14.12	Here is [encouragement for] the steadfast endurance of the saints (God’s people), those who 
REV.14.13	Then I heard [the distinct words of] a voice from heaven, saying, “Write, ‘
REV.14.14	Again I looked, and this is what I saw: a white cloud, and sitting on the cloud was One like the Son of Man, with a crown of gold on His head and a sharp sickle [of swift judgment] in His hand. 
REV.14.15	And another angel came out of the temple, calling with a loud voice to Him who was sitting upon the cloud, “Put in Your sickle and reap [at once], for the hour to reap [in judgment] has arrived, because the earth’s harvest is fully ripened.” 
REV.14.16	So He who was sitting on the cloud cast His sickle over the earth, and the earth was reaped (judged).
REV.14.17	Then another angel came out of the temple (sanctuary) in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle. 
REV.14.18	And another angel came from the altar, the one who has power over fire; and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, “Put in your sharp sickle and reap the clusters of grapes from the vine of the earth, because her grapes are ripe [for judgment].” 
REV.14.19	So the angel swung his sickle to the earth and harvested the grapevine of the earth, and threw the grapes into the great wine press of the wrath 
REV.14.20	And 
REV.15.1	Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and wonderful [a warning of terrifying and horrible events]: seven angels who had seven plagues (afflictions, calamities), 
REV.15.2	Then I saw something like a sea 
REV.15.3	And they 
REV.15.3	“
REV.15.3	O Lord God, the Almighty [the Omnipotent, the Ruler of all];
REV.15.3	Righteous and true are Your ways,
REV.15.3	O King of the 
REV.15.4	Who will not fear [reverently] and glorify Your name, O Lord [giving You honor and praise in worship]?
REV.15.4	For You alone are holy;
REV.15.4	For 
REV.15.4	F
REV.15.5	After these things I looked, and the temple (sanctuary) of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened, 
REV.15.6	and the seven angels who had the seven plagues (afflictions, calamities) came out of the temple, arrayed in linen, pure 
REV.15.7	Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath 
REV.15.8	And the temple was filled with 
REV.16.1	Then I heard a loud voice from the temple, saying to the seven angels, “Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath 
REV.16.2	So the first 
REV.16.3	The second 
REV.16.4	Then the third 
REV.16.5	And I heard the angel of the waters saying, “Righteous 
REV.16.6	for they have poured out the blood of the saints (God’s people) and the prophets, and You [in turn] have given them blood to drink. They deserve Your judgment.” 
REV.16.7	And I heard [another from] the altar saying, “Yes, O Lord God, the Almighty [the Omnipotent, the Ruler of all], Your judgments are true and fair 
REV.16.8	Then the fourth 
REV.16.9	People were [severely] burned by the great heat; and they reviled the name of God who has power over these plagues, but they did not repent [of their sin] and glorify Him.
REV.16.10	Then the fifth 
REV.16.11	and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their anguish and their sores (abscesses, boils); and they did not repent of what they had done 
REV.16.12	Then the sixth 
REV.16.13	And I saw three loathsome spirits like frogs, 
REV.16.14	for they are [actually] the spirits of demons, performing [miraculous] signs. And they go out to the kings of the entire inhabited earth, to gather them together for the war of the great day of God, the Almighty. 
REV.16.15	(“Behold, I am coming like a thief. 
REV.16.16	And they (demons) gathered the kings and armies of the world together at the place which in Hebrew is called 
REV.16.17	Then the seventh 
REV.16.18	And there were flashes of lightning and loud rumblings and peals of thunder; and there was a massive earthquake—nothing like it has ever occurred since mankind originated on the earth, so severe and far-reaching was that earthquake. 
REV.16.19	The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And God kept in mind Babylon the great, to give her the cup of the wine of His fierce 
REV.16.20	Then every island fled away, and no mountains could be found. 
REV.16.21	And giant hailstones, as heavy as a 
REV.17.1	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, “Come here, I will show you the judgment 
REV.17.2	 with whom the kings of the earth have 
REV.17.3	And the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness; and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was 
REV.17.4	The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold, precious stones and pearls, [and she was] holding in her hand a gold cup full of the abominations and the filth of her [sexual] immorality. 
REV.17.5	And on her forehead a name was written, a mystery: “BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES (false religions, heresies) AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.” 
REV.17.6	I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints (God’s people), and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus [who were martyred]. When I saw her, I wondered in amazement. 
REV.17.7	But the angel said to me, “Why do you wonder? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns.
REV.17.8	“The beast that you saw was [once], but [now] is not, and he is about to come up out of the abyss (the bottomless pit, the dwelling place of demons) and go to destruction (perdition). And the inhabitants of the earth, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, will be astonished when they see the beast, because he was and is not and is yet to come [to earth]. 
REV.17.9	Here is the mind which has wisdom [and this is what it knows about the vision]. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sits; 
REV.17.10	and they are seven kings: five of whom have fallen, one exists 
REV.17.11	And the beast that [once] was but is not, is himself also an eighth 
REV.17.12	The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but [together] they receive authority as kings for a single hour [for a common purpose] along with the beast. 
REV.17.13	These [kings] have one purpose [one mind, one common goal], and they give their power and authority to the beast.
REV.17.14	They will wage war against the Lamb (Christ), and the Lamb will triumph 
REV.17.15	Then the angel said to me, “The waters which you saw, where the prostitute is seated, are peoples and multitudes and nations and languages. 
REV.17.16	And the ten horns which you saw, and the 
REV.17.17	For God has put it in their hearts to carry out His purpose by 
REV.17.18	The woman whom you saw is the 
REV.18.1	After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven, possessing great authority, and the earth was illuminated with his splendor 
REV.18.2	And he shouted with a mighty voice, saying, “Fallen, fallen [certainly to be destroyed] is 
REV.18.3	For all the nations have drunk from the wine of the passion of her [sexual] immorality, and the kings 
REV.18.4	And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, “Come out of her, my people, so that you will not be a partner in her sins and receive her plagues; 
REV.18.5	for her sins (crimes, transgressions) have piled up as high as heaven, and God has remembered her wickedness 
REV.18.6	Repay to her even as she has repaid 
REV.18.7	To the degree that she glorified herself and reveled 
REV.18.8	For this reason in a single day her plagues (afflictions, calamities) will come, pestilence and mourning and famine, and she will be burned up with fire 
REV.18.9	“
REV.18.10	standing a long way off, in fear of her torment, saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, the strong city, Babylon! In a single hour your judgment has come.’
REV.18.11	“And merchants of the earth will weep and grieve over her, because no one buys their cargo (goods, merchandise) anymore— 
REV.18.12	cargoes of gold and silver and precious stones and pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet; all 
REV.18.13	and cinnamon and spices and incense and perfume and frankincense and wine and olive oil and fine flour and wheat; of cattle and sheep, and 
REV.18.14	The ripe fruits 
REV.18.15	The merchants who handled these articles, who grew wealthy from [their business with] her, will stand a long way off in fear of her torment, weeping and mourning aloud, 
REV.18.16	saying, ‘Woe, woe, for the great city that was robed in fine linen, in purple and scarlet, gilded 
REV.18.17	because in one hour all the vast wealth has been laid waste.’ And every ship captain 
REV.18.18	and exclaimed as they watched the smoke of her burning, saying, ‘What could be compared to the great city?’ 
REV.18.19	And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out, weeping and mourning, saying, ‘Woe, woe, for the great city, where all who had ships at sea grew rich from her great wealth, because in one hour she has been laid waste!’ 
REV.18.20	Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints (God’s people) and apostles and prophets [who were martyred], because God has executed vengeance for you [through righteous judgment] upon her.”
REV.18.21	Then a single powerful angel picked up a boulder like a great millstone and flung it into the sea, saying, “With such violence will Babylon the great city be hurled down [by the sudden, spectacular judgment of God], and will never again be found. 
REV.18.22	And the sound of harpists and musicians and flutists and trumpeters will never again be heard in you, and no skilled artisan of any craft will ever again be found in you, and the sound of the millstone [grinding grain] will never again be heard in you [for commerce will no longer flourish, and normal life will cease]. 
REV.18.23	And never again will the light of a lamp shine in you, and never again will the voice of the bridegroom and bride be heard in you; for your merchants were the great 
REV.18.24	And in Babylon was found the blood of prophets and of saints (God’s people) and of all those who have been slaughtered on the earth.”
REV.19.1	After these 
REV.19.1	“
REV.19.2	 H
REV.19.3	And a second time they said, “Hallelujah! H
REV.19.4	Then the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures also fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying, “Amen. Hallelujah (praise the Lord)!” 
REV.19.5	Then from the throne there came a voice, saying,
REV.19.5	“
REV.19.6	Then I heard 
REV.19.6	“
REV.19.7	Let us rejoice and shout for joy! Let us give Him glory 
REV.19.8	She has been permitted to dress in fine linen, dazzling white and clean—for the fine linen signifies the righteous acts of the saints [the ethical conduct, personal integrity, moral courage, and godly character of believers].
REV.19.9	Then the angel said to me, “Write, ‘
REV.19.10	Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he [stopped me and] said to me, “You must not do that; I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers and sisters who have 
REV.19.11	And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who was riding it is called Faithful and True (trustworthy, loyal, incorruptible, steady), and in righteousness He judges and wages war [on the rebellious nations]. 
REV.19.12	His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many royal crowns; and He has a name inscribed [on Him] which no one knows 
REV.19.13	He is dressed in a robe dipped in 
REV.19.14	And the armies of heaven, dressed in fine linen, [dazzling] white and clean, followed Him on white horses. 
REV.19.15	From His mouth comes a sharp sword (His word) with which He may strike down the nations, and He will 
REV.19.16	And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name inscribed, “KING OF KINGS, AND 
REV.19.17	Then I saw a single angel standing in the sun, and with a loud voice he shouted to all the birds that fly in midheaven, saying, “Come, gather together for the great supper of God, 
REV.19.18	so that you may feast on the flesh of kings, the flesh of commanders, the flesh of powerful 
REV.19.19	Then I saw the beast and the kings 
REV.19.20	And the beast (Antichrist) was seized 
REV.19.21	And the rest were killed with the sword which came from the mouth of Him who sat on the horse, and all the birds fed ravenously 
REV.20.2	And he overpowered 
REV.20.3	and the angel hurled him into the abyss, and closed it and sealed it above him [preventing his escape or rescue], so that he would no longer deceive 
REV.20.4	And then I saw thrones, and sitting on them were those to whom judgment [that is, the authority to act as judges] was given. And 
REV.20.5	The rest of the dead [the non-believers] did not come to life again until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection. 
REV.20.6	Blessed (happy, prosperous, to be admired) and holy is the person who takes part in the first resurrection; over these the second death [which is eternal separation from God, the lake of fire] has no power 
REV.20.7	And when the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison (the abyss), 
REV.20.8	and will come out to deceive 
REV.20.9	And they swarmed up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints (God’s people) and the beloved city [
REV.20.10	And the devil who had deceived them was hurled into the lake of fire and burning brimstone (sulfur), where the beast (Antichrist) and false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night, forever and ever.
REV.20.11	And I saw a great white throne and Him who was seated upon it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them [for this heaven and earth are passing away]. 
REV.20.12	And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is 
REV.20.13	And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, and death and Hades (the realm of the dead) surrendered the dead who were in them; and they were judged 
REV.20.14	Then death and Hades [the realm of the dead] were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire [the eternal separation from God]. 
REV.20.15	And if 
REV.21.1	Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away (vanished), and there is no longer any 
REV.21.2	And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, arrayed like a bride adorned for her husband; 
REV.21.3	and then I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, “See! The tabernacle of God is among men, and He will live among them, and they will be His people, and God Himself will be with them 
REV.21.4	and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be death; there will no longer be sorrow 
REV.21.5	And He who sits on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new.” Also He said, “Write, for these words are faithful and true [they are accurate, incorruptible, and trustworthy].” 
REV.21.6	And He said to me, “It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the one who thirsts I will give [water] from the fountain of the water of life without cost. 
REV.21.7	He who overcomes [the world by adhering faithfully to Christ Jesus as Lord and Savior] will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son. 
REV.21.8	But as for the cowards and unbelieving and abominable [who are devoid of character and personal integrity and practice or tolerate immorality], and murderers, and sorcerers [with intoxicating drugs], and idolaters 
REV.21.9	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls filled with the seven final plagues came and spoke with me, saying, “Come here, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.” 
REV.21.10	And he carried me away in the Spirit to a vast and lofty mountain, and showed me the holy (sanctified) city of Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God, 
REV.21.11	having God’s glory [filled with His radiant light]. The brilliance of it resembled a rare 
REV.21.12	It had a massive and high wall, with twelve [large] gates, and at the gates [were stationed] twelve angels; and on the gates the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel were written. 
REV.21.13	On the east side [there were] three gates, on the north three gates, on the south three gates, and on the west three gates. 
REV.21.14	And the wall of the city had twelve foundation stones, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb (Christ).
REV.21.15	The one who was speaking with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, and its gates and its wall. 
REV.21.16	The city is laid out as a square, its length being the same as its width; and he measured the city with his rod—twelve thousand stadia (about 1,400 miles); its length and width and height are equal. 
REV.21.17	He measured its wall also—a hundred forty-four cubits (about 200 feet), 
REV.21.18	The wall was built of jasper; and the city was pure gold, transparent like clear crystal. 
REV.21.19	The foundation stones of the wall of the city were adorned with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation stone was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, 
REV.21.20	the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite (yellow topaz); the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst. 
REV.21.21	And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each separate gate was of one single pearl. And the street (broad way) of the city was pure gold, like transparent crystal.
REV.21.22	I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty [the Omnipotent, the Ruler of all] and the Lamb are its temple. 
REV.21.23	And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon to give light to it, for the glory (splendor, radiance) of God has illumined it, and the Lamb is its lamp 
REV.21.24	The nations [the redeemed people from the earth] will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring into it their glory. 
REV.21.25	By day (for there will be no night there) its gates will never be closed [in fear of evil]; 
REV.21.26	and they will bring the glory (splendor, majesty) and the honor of the nations into it; 
REV.21.27	and nothing that defiles 
REV.22.1	Then the angel showed me a river of the water of life, clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb (Christ), 
REV.22.2	in the middle of its street. On either side of the river was the tree of life, bearing twelve 
REV.22.3	There will no longer exist anything that is cursed [because sin and illness and death are gone]; and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His bond-servants will serve 
REV.22.4	they will [be privileged to] see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads. 
REV.22.5	And there will no longer be night; they have no need for lamplight or sunlight, because the Lord God will illumine them; and they will reign [as kings] forever and ever.
REV.22.6	Then he said to me, “These words are faithful and true.” And the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent His angel [as a representative] to show His bond-servants the things that must soon take place.
REV.22.8	I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things. 
REV.22.9	But he said to me, “Do not do that. I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers the prophets and with those who heed 
REV.22.10	And he said to me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time [of their fulfillment] is 
REV.22.11	Let the one who does wrong, still do wrong; and the one who is filthy (vile, impure), still be filthy; and the one who is righteous (just, upright), still be righteous; and the one who is holy, still be holy.”
REV.22.13	 [the Eternal One].”
REV.22.15	Outside are the dogs [the godless, the impure, those of low moral character] and the sorcerers [with their intoxicating drugs, and magic arts], and the immoral persons [the perverted, the molesters, and the adulterers], and the murderers, and the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices lying (deception, cheating).
REV.22.17	The [Holy] Spirit and the bride (the church, believers) say, “Come.” And let the one who hears say, “Come.” And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who wishes take 
REV.22.18	I testify 
REV.22.19	and if anyone takes away from 
REV.22.20	He who testifies 
REV.22.21	The grace of the Lord Jesus (the Christ, the Messiah) be with all [the saints—all believers, those set apart for God]. Amen.
