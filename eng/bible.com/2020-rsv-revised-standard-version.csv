GEN.1.2	The earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the Spirit
GEN.1.3	And God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. 
GEN.1.4	And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. 
GEN.1.5	God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.
GEN.1.6	And God said, “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.” 
GEN.1.7	And God made the firmament and separated the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so. 
GEN.1.8	And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.
GEN.1.9	And God said, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so. 
GEN.1.10	God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.11	And God said, “Let the earth put forth vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, upon the earth.” And it was so. 
GEN.1.12	The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.13	And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.
GEN.1.14	And God said, “Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years, 
GEN.1.15	and let them be lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth.” And it was so. 
GEN.1.16	And God made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; he made the stars also. 
GEN.1.17	And God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth, 
GEN.1.18	to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.19	And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
GEN.1.20	And God said, “Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the firmament of the heavens.” 
GEN.1.21	So God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.22	And God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” 
GEN.1.23	And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
GEN.1.24	And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so. 
GEN.1.25	And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the cattle according to their kinds, and everything that creeps upon the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
GEN.1.27	So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. 
GEN.1.28	And God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.” 
GEN.1.29	And God said, “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food. 
GEN.1.30	And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so. 
GEN.1.31	And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.
GEN.2.2	 And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done. 
GEN.2.3	So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all his work which he had done in creation.
GEN.2.4	These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created.
GEN.2.4	In the day that the 
GEN.2.5	when no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up—for the 
GEN.2.6	but a mist
GEN.2.7	 then the 
GEN.2.8	And the 
GEN.2.9	 And out of the ground the 
GEN.2.10	A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers. 
GEN.2.11	The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one which flows around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 
GEN.2.12	and the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there. 
GEN.2.13	The name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one which flows around the whole land of Cush. 
GEN.2.14	And the name of the third river is Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
GEN.2.15	The 
GEN.2.16	And the 
GEN.2.17	but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die.”
GEN.2.18	Then the 
GEN.2.19	So out of the ground the 
GEN.2.20	The man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for the man there was not found a helper fit for him. 
GEN.2.21	So the 
GEN.2.22	and the rib which the 
GEN.2.23	Then the man said,
GEN.2.23	“This at last is bone of my bones
GEN.2.23	and flesh of my flesh;
GEN.2.23	she shall be called Woman,
GEN.2.23	because she was taken out of Man.”
GEN.2.25	And the man and his wife were both naked, and were not ashamed.
GEN.3.2	And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden; 
GEN.3.3	but God said, ‘You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.’ ” 
GEN.3.4	 But the serpent said to the woman, “You will not die. 
GEN.3.5	For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” 
GEN.3.6	So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate; and she also gave some to her husband, and he ate. 
GEN.3.7	Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons.
GEN.3.8	And they heard the sound of the 
GEN.3.9	But the 
GEN.3.10	And he said, “I heard the sound of thee in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.” 
GEN.3.11	He said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?” 
GEN.3.12	The man said, “The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate.” 
GEN.3.13	 Then the 
GEN.3.14	 The 
GEN.3.14	“Because you have done this,
GEN.3.14	cursed are you above all cattle,
GEN.3.14	and above all wild animals;
GEN.3.14	upon your belly you shall go,
GEN.3.14	and dust you shall eat
GEN.3.14	all the days of your life.
GEN.3.15	I will put enmity between you and the woman,
GEN.3.15	and between your seed and her seed;
GEN.3.15	he shall bruise your head,
GEN.3.15	and you shall bruise his heel.”
GEN.3.16	To the woman he said,
GEN.3.16	“I will greatly multiply your pain in childbearing;
GEN.3.16	in pain you shall bring forth children,
GEN.3.16	yet your desire shall be for your husband,
GEN.3.16	and he shall rule over you.”
GEN.3.17	“Because you have listened to the voice of your wife,
GEN.3.17	and have eaten of the tree
GEN.3.17	of which I commanded you,
GEN.3.17	‘You shall not eat of it,’
GEN.3.17	cursed is the ground because of you;
GEN.3.17	in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life;
GEN.3.18	thorns and thistles it shall bring forth to you;
GEN.3.18	and you shall eat the plants of the field.
GEN.3.19	In the sweat of your face
GEN.3.19	you shall eat bread
GEN.3.19	till you return to the ground,
GEN.3.19	for out of it you were taken;
GEN.3.19	you are dust,
GEN.3.19	and to dust you shall return.”
GEN.3.20	The man called his wife's name Eve,
GEN.3.21	And the 
GEN.3.23	therefore the 
GEN.3.24	He drove out the man; and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.
GEN.4.1	Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, “I have gotten
GEN.4.2	And again, she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a tiller of the ground. 
GEN.4.3	In the course of time Cain brought to the 
GEN.4.4	 and Abel brought of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions. And the 
GEN.4.5	but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell. 
GEN.4.6	The 
GEN.4.7	If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is couching at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it.”
GEN.4.9	Then the 
GEN.4.10	And the 
GEN.4.11	And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand. 
GEN.4.12	When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield to you its strength; you shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.” 
GEN.4.13	Cain said to the 
GEN.4.14	Behold, thou hast driven me this day away from the ground; and from thy face I shall be hidden; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will slay me.” 
GEN.4.15	Then the 
GEN.4.16	Then Cain went away from the presence of the 
GEN.4.17	Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch; and he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch. 
GEN.4.18	To Enoch was born Irad; and Irad was the father of Me-huja-el, and Me-huja-el the father of Me-thusha-el, and Me-thusha-el the father of Lamech. 
GEN.4.19	And Lamech took two wives; the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. 
GEN.4.20	Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have cattle. 
GEN.4.21	His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe. 
GEN.4.22	Zillah bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
GEN.4.23	Lamech said to his wives:
GEN.4.23	“Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;
GEN.4.23	you wives of Lamech, hearken to what I say:
GEN.4.23	I have slain a man for wounding me,
GEN.4.23	a young man for striking me.
GEN.4.24	If Cain is avenged sevenfold,
GEN.4.24	truly Lamech seventy-sevenfold.”
GEN.4.25	And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Seth, for she said, “God has appointed for me another child instead of Abel, for Cain slew him.” 
GEN.4.26	To Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. At that time men began to call upon the name of the 
GEN.5.2	Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them Man when they were created. 
GEN.5.3	When Adam had lived a hundred and thirty years, he became the father of a son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth. 
GEN.5.4	The days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years; and he had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.5	Thus all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years; and he died.
GEN.5.6	When Seth had lived a hundred and five years, he became the father of Enosh. 
GEN.5.7	Seth lived after the birth of Enosh eight hundred and seven years, and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.8	Thus all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years; and he died.
GEN.5.9	When Enosh had lived ninety years, he became the father of Kenan. 
GEN.5.10	Enosh lived after the birth of Kenan eight hundred and fifteen years, and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.11	Thus all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years; and he died.
GEN.5.12	When Kenan had lived seventy years, he became the father of Ma-halalel. 
GEN.5.13	Kenan lived after the birth of Ma-halalel eight hundred and forty years, and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.14	Thus all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.
GEN.5.15	When Ma-halalel had lived sixty-five years, he became the father of Jared. 
GEN.5.16	Ma-halalel lived after the birth of Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.17	Thus all the days of Ma-halalel were eight hundred and ninety-five years; and he died.
GEN.5.18	When Jared had lived a hundred and sixty-two years he became the father of Enoch. 
GEN.5.19	Jared lived after the birth of Enoch eight hundred years, and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.20	Thus all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years; and he died.
GEN.5.21	When Enoch had lived sixty-five years, he became the father of Methuselah. 
GEN.5.22	Enoch walked with God after the birth of Methuselah three hundred years, and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.23	Thus all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years. 
GEN.5.24	 Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him.
GEN.5.25	When Methuselah had lived a hundred and eighty-seven years, he became the father of Lamech. 
GEN.5.26	Methuselah lived after the birth of Lamech seven hundred and eighty-two years, and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.27	Thus all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty-nine years; and he died.
GEN.5.28	When Lamech had lived a hundred and eighty-two years, he became the father of a son, 
GEN.5.29	and called his name Noah, saying, “Out of the ground which the 
GEN.5.30	Lamech lived after the birth of Noah five hundred and ninety-five years, and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.31	Thus all the days of Lamech were seven hundred and seventy-seven years; and he died.
GEN.5.32	After Noah was five hundred years old, Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
GEN.6.1	When men began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born to them, 
GEN.6.2	the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fair; and they took to wife such of them as they chose. 
GEN.6.3	Then the 
GEN.6.4	 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.
GEN.6.5	The 
GEN.6.6	And the 
GEN.6.7	So the 
GEN.6.8	But Noah found favor in the eyes of the 
GEN.6.9	These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation; Noah walked with God. 
GEN.6.10	And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
GEN.6.11	Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight, and the earth was filled with violence. 
GEN.6.12	And God saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth. 
GEN.6.13	And God said to Noah, “I have determined to make an end of all flesh; for the earth is filled with violence through them; behold, I will destroy them with the earth. 
GEN.6.14	Make yourself an ark of gopher wood; make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch. 
GEN.6.15	This is how you are to make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits. 
GEN.6.16	Make a roof
GEN.6.17	For behold, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life from under heaven; everything that is on the earth shall die. 
GEN.6.18	But I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you. 
GEN.6.19	And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female. 
GEN.6.20	Of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground according to its kind, two of every sort shall come in to you, to keep them alive. 
GEN.6.21	Also take with you every sort of food that is eaten, and store it up; and it shall serve as food for you and for them.” 
GEN.6.22	Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him.
GEN.7.1	Then the 
GEN.7.2	Take with you seven pairs of all clean animals, the male and his mate; and a pair of the animals that are not clean, the male and his mate; 
GEN.7.3	and seven pairs of the birds of the air also, male and female, to keep their kind alive upon the face of all the earth. 
GEN.7.4	For in seven days I will send rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground.” 
GEN.7.5	And Noah did all that the 
GEN.7.6	Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came upon the earth. 
GEN.7.7	 And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him went into the ark, to escape the waters of the flood. 
GEN.7.8	Of clean animals, and of animals that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creeps on the ground, 
GEN.7.9	two and two, male and female, went into the ark with Noah, as God had commanded Noah. 
GEN.7.10	And after seven days the waters of the flood came upon the earth.
GEN.7.11	In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened. 
GEN.7.12	And rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights. 
GEN.7.13	On the very same day Noah and his sons, Shem and Ham and Japheth, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them entered the ark, 
GEN.7.14	they and every beast according to its kind, and all the cattle according to their kinds, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth according to its kind, every bird according to its kind, every bird of every sort. 
GEN.7.15	They went into the ark with Noah, two and two of all flesh in which there was the breath of life. 
GEN.7.16	And they that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him; and the 
GEN.7.17	The flood continued forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it rose high above the earth. 
GEN.7.18	The waters prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark floated on the face of the waters. 
GEN.7.19	And the waters prevailed so mightily upon the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered; 
GEN.7.20	the waters prevailed above the mountains, covering them fifteen cubits deep. 
GEN.7.21	And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, birds, cattle, beasts, all swarming creatures that swarm upon the earth, and every man; 
GEN.7.22	everything on the dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died. 
GEN.7.23	He blotted out every living thing that was upon the face of the ground, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the air; they were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those that were with him in the ark. 
GEN.7.24	And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.
GEN.8.1	But God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided; 
GEN.8.2	the fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained, 
GEN.8.3	and the waters receded from the earth continually. At the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters had abated; 
GEN.8.4	and in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest upon the mountains of Ararat. 
GEN.8.5	And the waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.
GEN.8.6	At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made, 
GEN.8.7	and sent forth a raven; and it went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth. 
GEN.8.8	Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground; 
GEN.8.9	but the dove found no place to set her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put forth his hand and took her and brought her into the ark with him. 
GEN.8.10	He waited another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; 
GEN.8.11	and the dove came back to him in the evening, and lo, in her mouth a freshly plucked olive leaf; so Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth. 
GEN.8.12	Then he waited another seven days, and sent forth the dove; and she did not return to him any more.
GEN.8.13	In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried from off the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry. 
GEN.8.14	In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry. 
GEN.8.15	Then God said to Noah, 
GEN.8.16	“Go forth from the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons' wives with you. 
GEN.8.17	Bring forth with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh—birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth—that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth.” 
GEN.8.18	So Noah went forth, and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him. 
GEN.8.19	And every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves upon the earth, went forth by families out of the ark.
GEN.8.20	Then Noah built an altar to the 
GEN.8.21	And when the 
GEN.8.22	While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease.”
GEN.9.1	And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth. 
GEN.9.2	The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird of the air, upon everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea; into your hand they are delivered. 
GEN.9.3	Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; and as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything. 
GEN.9.4	 Only you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood. 
GEN.9.5	For your lifeblood I will surely require a reckoning; of every beast I will require it and of man; of every man's brother I will require the life of man. 
GEN.9.6	Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; for God made man in his own image. 
GEN.9.7	And you, be fruitful and multiply, bring forth abundantly on the earth and multiply in it.”
GEN.9.8	Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him, 
GEN.9.9	“Behold, I establish my covenant with you and your descendants after you, 
GEN.9.10	and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark.
GEN.9.11	I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.” 
GEN.9.12	And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations: 
GEN.9.13	I set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth. 
GEN.9.14	When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds, 
GEN.9.15	I will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh. 
GEN.9.16	When the bow is in the clouds, I will look upon it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.” 
GEN.9.17	God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.”
GEN.9.18	The sons of Noah who went forth from the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham was the father of Canaan. 
GEN.9.19	These three were the sons of Noah; and from these the whole earth was peopled.
GEN.9.20	Noah was the first tiller of the soil. He planted a vineyard; 
GEN.9.21	and he drank of the wine, and became drunk, and lay uncovered in his tent. 
GEN.9.22	And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside. 
GEN.9.23	Then Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it upon both their shoulders, and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father; their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father's nakedness. 
GEN.9.24	When Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his youngest son had done to him, 
GEN.9.25	he said,
GEN.9.25	“Cursed be Canaan;
GEN.9.25	a slave of slaves shall he be to his brothers.”
GEN.9.26	He also said,
GEN.9.26	“Blessed by the 
GEN.9.26	and let Canaan be his slave.
GEN.9.27	God enlarge Japheth,
GEN.9.27	and let him dwell in the tents of Shem;
GEN.9.27	and let Canaan be his slave.”
GEN.9.28	After the flood Noah lived three hundred and fifty years. 
GEN.9.29	All the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died.
GEN.10.1	These are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth; sons were born to them after the flood.
GEN.10.2	The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. 
GEN.10.3	The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. 
GEN.10.4	The sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 
GEN.10.5	From these the coastland peoples spread. These are the sons of Japheth
GEN.10.6	The sons of Ham: Cush, Egypt, Put, and Canaan. 
GEN.10.7	The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan. 
GEN.10.8	Cush became the father of Nimrod; he was the first on earth to be a mighty man. 
GEN.10.9	He was a mighty hunter before the 
GEN.10.10	The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, and Accad, all of them in the land of Shinar. 
GEN.10.11	From that land he went into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah, and 
GEN.10.12	Resen between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city. 
GEN.10.13	Egypt became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naph-tuhim, 
GEN.10.14	Pathrusim, Casluhim (whence came the Philistines), and Caphtorim.
GEN.10.15	Canaan became the father of Sidon his first-born, and Heth, 
GEN.10.16	and the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, 
GEN.10.17	the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, 
GEN.10.18	the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the families of the Canaanites spread abroad. 
GEN.10.19	And the territory of the Canaanites extended from Sidon, in the direction of Gerar, as far as Gaza, and in the direction of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. 
GEN.10.20	These are the sons of Ham, by their families, their languages, their lands, and their nations.
GEN.10.21	To Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, children were born. 
GEN.10.22	The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram. 
GEN.10.23	The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. 
GEN.10.24	Arpachshad became the father of Shelah; and Shelah became the father of Eber. 
GEN.10.25	To Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg,
GEN.10.26	Joktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 
GEN.10.27	Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 
GEN.10.28	Obal, Abima-el, Sheba, 
GEN.10.29	Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan. 
GEN.10.30	The territory in which they lived extended from Mesha in the direction of Sephar to the hill country of the east. 
GEN.10.31	These are the sons of Shem, by their families, their languages, their lands, and their nations.
GEN.10.32	These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their genealogies, in their nations; and from these the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood.
GEN.11.1	Now the whole earth had one language and few words. 
GEN.11.2	And as men migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. 
GEN.11.3	And they said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar. 
GEN.11.4	Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.” 
GEN.11.5	And the 
GEN.11.6	And the 
GEN.11.7	Come, let us go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.” 
GEN.11.8	So the 
GEN.11.9	Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the 
GEN.11.10	These are the descendants of Shem. When Shem was a hundred years old, he became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood; 
GEN.11.11	and Shem lived after the birth of Arpachshad five hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.12	When Arpachshad had lived thirty-five years, he became the father of Shelah; 
GEN.11.13	and Arpachshad lived after the birth of Shelah four hundred and three years, and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.14	When Shelah had lived thirty years, he became the father of Eber; 
GEN.11.15	and Shelah lived after the birth of Eber four hundred and three years, and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.16	When Eber had lived thirty-four years, he became the father of Peleg; 
GEN.11.17	and Eber lived after the birth of Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.18	When Peleg had lived thirty years, he became the father of Reu; 
GEN.11.19	and Peleg lived after the birth of Reu two hundred and nine years, and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.20	When Reu had lived thirty-two years, he became the father of Serug; 
GEN.11.21	and Reu lived after the birth of Serug two hundred and seven years, and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.22	When Serug had lived thirty years, he became the father of Nahor; 
GEN.11.23	and Serug lived after the birth of Nahor two hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.24	When Nahor had lived twenty-nine years, he became the father of Terah; 
GEN.11.25	and Nahor lived after the birth of Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.26	When Terah had lived seventy years, he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
GEN.11.27	Now these are the descendants of Terah. Terah was the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran was the father of Lot. 
GEN.11.28	Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans. 
GEN.11.29	And Abram and Nahor took wives; the name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and Iscah. 
GEN.11.30	Now Sarai was barren; she had no child.
GEN.11.31	Terah took Abram his son and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife, and they went forth together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the land of Canaan; but when they came to Haran, they settled there. 
GEN.11.32	The days of Terah were two hundred and five years; and Terah died in Haran.
GEN.12.2	 And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. 
GEN.12.3	 I will bless those who bless you, and him who curses you I will curse; and by you all the families of the earth shall bless themselves.”
GEN.12.4	So Abram went, as the 
GEN.12.5	And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their possessions which they had gathered, and the persons that they had gotten in Haran; and they set forth to go to the land of Canaan. When they had come to the land of Canaan, 
GEN.12.6	Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak
GEN.12.7	 Then the 
GEN.12.8	Thence he removed to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; and there he built an altar to the 
GEN.12.9	And Abram journeyed on, still going toward the Negeb.
GEN.12.11	When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, “I know that you are a woman beautiful to behold; 
GEN.12.12	and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife’; then they will kill me, but they will let you live. 
GEN.12.13	Say you are my sister, that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared on your account.” 
GEN.12.14	When Abram entered Egypt the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful. 
GEN.12.15	And when the princes of Pharaoh saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. 
GEN.12.16	And for her sake he dealt well with Abram; and he had sheep, oxen, he-asses, menservants, maidservants, she-asses, and camels.
GEN.12.17	But the 
GEN.12.18	So Pharaoh called Abram, and said, “What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife? 
GEN.12.19	Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife, take her, and be gone.” 
GEN.12.20	And Pharaoh gave men orders concerning him; and they set him on the way, with his wife and all that he had.
GEN.13.1	So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the Negeb.
GEN.13.2	Now Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. 
GEN.13.3	And he journeyed on from the Negeb as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, 
GEN.13.4	to the place where he had made an altar at the first; and there Abram called on the name of the 
GEN.13.5	And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents, 
GEN.13.6	so that the land could not support both of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together, 
GEN.13.7	and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites dwelt in the land.
GEN.13.8	Then Abram said to Lot, “Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen; for we are kinsmen. 
GEN.13.9	Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left.” 
GEN.13.10	And Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw that the Jordan valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of the 
GEN.13.11	So Lot chose for himself all the Jordan valley, and Lot journeyed east; thus they separated from each other. 
GEN.13.12	Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, while Lot dwelt among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom. 
GEN.13.13	Now the men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the 
GEN.13.14	The 
GEN.13.15	 for all the land which you see I will give to you and to your descendants for ever. 
GEN.13.16	I will make your descendants as the dust of the earth; so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your descendants also can be counted. 
GEN.13.17	Arise, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.” 
GEN.13.18	So Abram moved his tent, and came and dwelt by the oaks
GEN.14.1	In the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Ched-or-laomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, 
GEN.14.2	these kings made war with Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar). 
GEN.14.3	And all these joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea). 
GEN.14.4	Twelve years they had served Ched-or-laomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled. 
GEN.14.5	In the fourteenth year Ched-or-laomer and the kings who were with him came and subdued the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim, 
GEN.14.6	and the Horites in their Mount Seir as far as El-paran on the border of the wilderness; 
GEN.14.7	then they turned back and came to Enmishpat (that is, Kadesh), and subdued all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who dwelt in Hazazon-tamar. 
GEN.14.8	Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out, and they joined battle in the Valley of Siddim 
GEN.14.9	with Ched-or-laomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar, four kings against five. 
GEN.14.10	Now the Valley of Siddim was full of bitumen pits; and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them, and the rest fled to the mountain. 
GEN.14.11	So the enemy took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way; 
GEN.14.12	they also took Lot, the son of Abram's brother, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
GEN.14.13	Then one who had escaped came, and told Abram the Hebrew, who was living by the oaks
GEN.14.14	When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen of them, and went in pursuit as far as Dan. 
GEN.14.15	And he divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and routed them and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus. 
GEN.14.16	Then he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his kinsman Lot with his goods, and the women and the people.
GEN.14.18	And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine; he was priest of God Most High. 
GEN.14.19	And he blessed him and said,
GEN.14.19	“Blessed be Abram by God Most High,
GEN.14.19	maker of heaven and earth;
GEN.14.20	and blessed be God Most High,
GEN.14.20	who has delivered your enemies into your hand!”
GEN.14.20	And Abram gave him a tenth of everything. 
GEN.14.21	And the king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself.” 
GEN.14.22	But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have sworn to the 
GEN.14.23	that I would not take a thread or a sandal-thong or anything that is yours, lest you should say, ‘I have made Abram rich.’ 
GEN.14.24	I will take nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me; let Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre take their share.”
GEN.15.1	After these things the word of the 
GEN.15.2	But Abram said, “O Lord 
GEN.15.3	And Abram said, “Behold, thou hast given me no offspring; and a slave born in my house will be my heir.” 
GEN.15.4	 And behold, the word of the 
GEN.15.5	 And he brought him outside and said, “Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your descendants be.” 
GEN.15.6	 And he believed the 
GEN.15.7	And he said to him, “I am the 
GEN.15.8	But he said, “O Lord 
GEN.15.9	He said to him, “Bring me a heifer three years old, a she-goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.” 
GEN.15.10	And he brought him all these, cut them in two, and laid each half over against the other; but he did not cut the birds in two. 
GEN.15.11	And when birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, Abram drove them away.
GEN.15.12	As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram; and lo, a dread and great darkness fell upon him. 
GEN.15.13	 Then the 
GEN.15.14	but I will bring judgment on the nation which they serve, and afterward they shall come out with great possessions. 
GEN.15.15	As for yourself, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age. 
GEN.15.16	And they shall come back here in the fourth generation; for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.”
GEN.15.17	When the sun had gone down and it was dark, behold, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces. 
GEN.15.18	 On that day the 
GEN.15.19	the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, 
GEN.15.20	the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, 
GEN.15.21	the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites and the Jebusites.”
GEN.16.1	Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bore him no children. She had an Egyptian maid whose name was Hagar; 
GEN.16.2	and Sarai said to Abram, “Behold now, the 
GEN.16.3	So, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her maid, and gave her to Abram her husband as a wife. 
GEN.16.4	And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress. 
GEN.16.5	And Sarai said to Abram, “May the wrong done to me be on you! I gave my maid to your embrace, and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked on me with contempt. May the 
GEN.16.6	But Abram said to Sarai, “Behold, your maid is in your power; do to her as you please.” Then Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her.
GEN.16.7	The angel of the 
GEN.16.8	And he said, “Hagar, maid of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?” She said, “I am fleeing from my mistress Sarai.” 
GEN.16.9	The angel of the 
GEN.16.10	The angel of the 
GEN.16.11	And the angel of the 
GEN.16.12	He shall be a wild ass of a man, his hand against every man and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell over against all his kinsmen.” 
GEN.16.13	So she called the name of the 
GEN.16.14	Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi;
GEN.16.15	And Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. 
GEN.16.16	Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
GEN.17.1	When Abram was ninety-nine years old the 
GEN.17.2	And I will make my covenant between me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.” 
GEN.17.3	Then Abram fell on his face; and God said to him, 
GEN.17.4	“Behold, my covenant is with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations. 
GEN.17.5	 No longer shall your name be Abram,
GEN.17.6	I will make you exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come forth from you. 
GEN.17.7	 And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your descendants after you. 
GEN.17.8	 And I will give to you, and to your descendants after you, the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.”
GEN.17.9	And God said to Abraham, “As for you, you shall keep my covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations. 
GEN.17.10	 This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your descendants after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised. 
GEN.17.11	 You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you. 
GEN.17.12	He that is eight days old among you shall be circumcised; every male throughout your generations, whether born in your house, or bought with your money from any foreigner who is not of your offspring, 
GEN.17.13	both he that is born in your house and he that is bought with your money, shall be circumcised. So shall my covenant be in your flesh an everlasting covenant. 
GEN.17.14	Any uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.”
GEN.17.15	And God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name. 
GEN.17.16	I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her; I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peoples shall come from her.” 
GEN.17.17	Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said to himself, “Shall a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?” 
GEN.17.18	And Abraham said to God, “O that Ishmael might live in thy sight!” 
GEN.17.19	God said, “No, but Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac.
GEN.17.20	As for Ishmael, I have heard you; behold, I will bless him and make him fruitful and multiply him exceedingly; he shall be the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation. 
GEN.17.21	But I will establish my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this season next year.”
GEN.17.22	When he had finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham. 
GEN.17.23	Then Abraham took Ishmael his son and all the slaves born in his house or bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house, and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that very day, as God had said to him. 
GEN.17.24	Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
GEN.17.25	And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
GEN.17.26	That very day Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised; 
GEN.17.27	and all the men of his house, those born in the house and those bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
GEN.18.1	And the 
GEN.18.2	He lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, three men stood in front of him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them, and bowed himself to the earth, 
GEN.18.3	and said, “My lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant. 
GEN.18.4	Let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree, 
GEN.18.5	while I fetch a morsel of bread, that you may refresh yourselves, and after that you may pass on—since you have come to your servant.” So they said, “Do as you have said.” 
GEN.18.6	And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, “Make ready quickly three measures
GEN.18.7	And Abraham ran to the herd, and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to the servant, who hastened to prepare it. 
GEN.18.8	Then he took curds, and milk, and the calf which he had prepared, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree while they ate.
GEN.18.9	They said to him, “Where is Sarah your wife?” And he said, “She is in the tent.” 
GEN.18.10	 The 
GEN.18.11	Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. 
GEN.18.12	 So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, “After I have grown old, and my husband is old, shall I have pleasure?” 
GEN.18.13	The 
GEN.18.14	 Is anything too hard
GEN.18.15	But Sarah denied, saying, “I did not laugh”; for she was afraid. He said, “No, but you did laugh.”
GEN.18.16	Then the men set out from there, and they looked toward Sodom; and Abraham went with them to set them on their way. 
GEN.18.17	The 
GEN.18.18	 seeing that Abraham shall become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall bless themselves by him?
GEN.18.19	No, for I have chosen
GEN.18.20	Then the 
GEN.18.21	I will go down to see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry which has come to me; and if not, I will know.”
GEN.18.22	So the men turned from there, and went toward Sodom; but Abraham still stood before the 
GEN.18.23	Then Abraham drew near, and said, “Wilt thou indeed destroy the righteous with the wicked? 
GEN.18.24	Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; wilt thou then destroy the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in it? 
GEN.18.25	Far be it from thee to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from thee! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?” 
GEN.18.26	And the 
GEN.18.27	Abraham answered, “Behold, I have taken upon myself to speak to the Lord, I who am but dust and ashes. 
GEN.18.28	Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking? Wilt thou destroy the whole city for lack of five?” And he said, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.” 
GEN.18.29	Again he spoke to him, and said, “Suppose forty are found there.” He answered, “For the sake of forty I will not do it.” 
GEN.18.30	Then he said, “Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak. Suppose thirty are found there.” He answered, “I will not do it, if I find thirty there.” 
GEN.18.31	He said, “Behold, I have taken upon myself to speak to the Lord. Suppose twenty are found there.” He answered, “For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it.” 
GEN.18.32	Then he said, “Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak again but this once. Suppose ten are found there.” He answered, “For the sake of ten I will not destroy it.” 
GEN.18.33	And the 
GEN.19.1	The two angels came to Sodom in the evening; and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them, and bowed himself with his face to the earth, 
GEN.19.2	and said, “My lords, turn aside, I pray you, to your servant's house and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you may rise up early and go on your way.” They said, “No; we will spend the night in the street.” 
GEN.19.3	But he urged them strongly; so they turned aside to him and entered his house; and he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. 
GEN.19.4	But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house; 
GEN.19.5	and they called to Lot, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, that we may know them.” 
GEN.19.6	Lot went out of the door to the men, shut the door after him, 
GEN.19.7	and said, “I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly. 
GEN.19.8	Behold, I have two daughters who have not known man; let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you please; only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof.” 
GEN.19.9	But they said, “Stand back!” And they said, “This fellow came to sojourn, and he would play the judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them.” Then they pressed hard against the man Lot, and drew near to break the door. 
GEN.19.10	But the men put forth their hands and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door. 
GEN.19.11	And they struck with blindness the men who were at the door of the house, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves groping for the door.
GEN.19.12	Then the men said to Lot, “Have you any one else here? Sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or any one you have in the city, bring them out of the place; 
GEN.19.13	for we are about to destroy this place, because the outcry against its people has become great before the 
GEN.19.14	So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, “Up, get out of this place; for the 
GEN.19.15	When morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Arise, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the punishment of the city.” 
GEN.19.16	But he lingered; so the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand, the 
GEN.19.17	And when they had brought them forth, they
GEN.19.18	And Lot said to them, “Oh, no, my lords; 
GEN.19.19	behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life; but I cannot flee to the hills, lest the disaster overtake me, and I die. 
GEN.19.20	Behold, yonder city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Let me escape there—is it not a little one?—and my life will be saved!” 
GEN.19.21	He said to him, “Behold, I grant you this favor also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken. 
GEN.19.22	Make haste, escape there; for I can do nothing till you arrive there.” Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
GEN.19.23	The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.
GEN.19.25	and he overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground. 
GEN.19.26	 But Lot's wife behind him looked back, and she became a pillar of salt. 
GEN.19.27	And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the 
GEN.19.28	 and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the valley, and beheld, and lo, smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace.
GEN.19.29	So it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.
GEN.19.30	Now Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the hills with his two daughters, for he was afraid to dwell in Zoar; so he dwelt in a cave with his two daughters. 
GEN.19.31	And the first-born said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth. 
GEN.19.32	Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve offspring through our father.” 
GEN.19.33	So they made their father drink wine that night; and the first-born went in, and lay with her father; he did not know when she lay down or when she arose. 
GEN.19.34	And on the next day, the first-born said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with my father; let us make him drink wine tonight also; then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve offspring through our father.” 
GEN.19.35	So they made their father drink wine that night also; and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose. 
GEN.19.36	Thus both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father. 
GEN.19.37	The first-born bore a son, and called his name Moab; he is the father of the Moabites to this day. 
GEN.19.38	The younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi; he is the father of the Ammonites to this day.
GEN.20.1	From there Abraham journeyed toward the territory of the Negeb, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar. 
GEN.20.2	And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah. 
GEN.20.3	But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken; for she is a man's wife.” 
GEN.20.4	Now Abimelech had not approached her; so he said, “Lord, wilt thou slay an innocent people? 
GEN.20.5	Did he not himself say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.” 
GEN.20.6	Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning against me; therefore I did not let you touch her. 
GEN.20.7	Now then restore the man's wife; for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you shall live. But if you do not restore her, know that you shall surely die, you, and all that are yours.”
GEN.20.8	So Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told them all these things; and the men were very much afraid. 
GEN.20.9	Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, “What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done.” 
GEN.20.10	And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What were you thinking of, that you did this thing?” 
GEN.20.11	Abraham said, “I did it because I thought, There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife. 
GEN.20.12	Besides she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. 
GEN.20.13	And when God caused me to wander from my father's house, I said to her, ‘This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, He is my brother.’ ” 
GEN.20.14	Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male and female slaves, and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah his wife to him. 
GEN.20.15	And Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you.” 
GEN.20.16	To Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver; it is your vindication in the eyes of all who are with you; and before every one you are righted.” 
GEN.20.17	Then Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech, and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children. 
GEN.20.18	For the 
GEN.21.1	The 
GEN.21.2	And Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time of which God had spoken to him. 
GEN.21.3	Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore him, Isaac. 
GEN.21.4	 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. 
GEN.21.5	Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. 
GEN.21.6	And Sarah said, “God has made laughter for me; every one who hears will laugh over me.” 
GEN.21.7	And she said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would suckle children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.”
GEN.21.8	And the child grew, and was weaned; and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. 
GEN.21.9	But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, playing with her son Isaac.
GEN.21.10	 So she said to Abraham, “Cast out this slave woman with her son; for the son of this slave woman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.” 
GEN.21.11	And the thing was very displeasing to Abraham on account of his son. 
GEN.21.12	 But God said to Abraham, “Be not displeased because of the lad and because of your slave woman; whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for through Isaac shall your descendants be named. 
GEN.21.13	And I will make a nation of the son of the slave woman also, because he is your offspring.” 
GEN.21.14	So Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.
GEN.21.15	When the water in the skin was gone, she cast the child under one of the bushes. 
GEN.21.16	Then she went, and sat down over against him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot; for she said, “Let me not look upon the death of the child.” And as she sat over against him, the child lifted up his voice
GEN.21.17	And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Fear not; for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is. 
GEN.21.18	Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him fast with your hand; for I will make him a great nation.” 
GEN.21.19	Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the skin with water, and gave the lad a drink. 
GEN.21.20	And God was with the lad, and he grew up; he lived in the wilderness, and became an expert with the bow. 
GEN.21.21	He lived in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
GEN.21.22	At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham, “God is with you in all that you do; 
GEN.21.23	now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my offspring or with my posterity, but as I have dealt loyally with you, you will deal with me and with the land where you have sojourned.” 
GEN.21.24	And Abraham said, “I will swear.”
GEN.21.25	When Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well of water which Abimelech's servants had seized, 
GEN.21.26	Abimelech said, “I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, and I have not heard of it until today.” 
GEN.21.27	So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant. 
GEN.21.28	Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock apart. 
GEN.21.29	And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs which you have set apart?” 
GEN.21.30	He said, “These seven ewe lambs you will take from my hand, that you may be a witness for me that I dug this well.” 
GEN.21.31	 Therefore that place was called Beer-sheba;
GEN.21.32	So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army rose up and returned to the land of the Philistines. 
GEN.21.33	Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the 
GEN.21.34	And Abraham sojourned many days in the land of the Philistines.
GEN.22.2	He said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering upon one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.” 
GEN.22.3	So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac; and he cut the wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him. 
GEN.22.4	On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off. 
GEN.22.5	Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the ass; I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.” 
GEN.22.6	And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it on Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together. 
GEN.22.7	And Isaac said to his father Abraham, “My father!” And he said, “Here am I, my son.” He said, “Behold, the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?” 
GEN.22.8	Abraham said, “God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So they went both of them together.
GEN.22.10	Then Abraham put forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. 
GEN.22.11	But the angel of the 
GEN.22.12	He said, “Do not lay your hand on the lad or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.” 
GEN.22.13	And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns; and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son. 
GEN.22.14	So Abraham called the name of that place The 
GEN.22.15	And the angel of the 
GEN.22.16	 and said, “By myself I have sworn, says the 
GEN.22.17	I will indeed bless you, and I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is on the seashore. And your descendants shall possess the gate of their enemies, 
GEN.22.18	 and by your descendants shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves, because you have obeyed my voice.” 
GEN.22.19	So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.
GEN.22.20	Now after these things it was told Abraham, “Behold, Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor: 
GEN.22.21	Uz the first-born, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, 
GEN.22.22	Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” 
GEN.22.23	Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother. 
GEN.22.24	Moreover, his concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
GEN.23.1	Sarah lived a hundred and twenty-seven years; these were the years of the life of Sarah. 
GEN.23.2	And Sarah died at Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan; and Abraham went in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her. 
GEN.23.3	And Abraham rose up from before his dead, and said to the Hittites, 
GEN.23.4	 “I am a stranger and a sojourner among you; give me property among you for a burying place, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.” 
GEN.23.5	The Hittites answered Abraham, 
GEN.23.6	“Hear us, my lord; you are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our sepulchres; none of us will withhold from you his sepulchre, or hinder you from burying your dead.” 
GEN.23.7	Abraham rose and bowed to the Hittites, the people of the land. 
GEN.23.8	And he said to them, “If you are willing that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me Ephron the son of Zohar, 
GEN.23.9	that he may give me the cave of Mach-pelah, which he owns; it is at the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in your presence as a possession for a burying place.” 
GEN.23.10	Now Ephron was sitting among the Hittites; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites, of all who went in at the gate of his city, 
GEN.23.11	“No, my lord, hear me; I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it; in the presence of the sons of my people I give it to you; bury your dead.” 
GEN.23.12	Then Abraham bowed down before the people of the land. 
GEN.23.13	And he said to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, “But if you will, hear me; I will give the price of the field; accept it from me, that I may bury my dead there.” 
GEN.23.14	Ephron answered Abraham, 
GEN.23.15	“My lord, listen to me; a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between you and me? Bury your dead.” 
GEN.23.16	 Abraham agreed with Ephron; and Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the Hittites, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weights current among the merchants.
GEN.23.17	So the field of Ephron in Mach-pelah, which was to the east of Mamre, the field with the cave which was in it and all the trees that were in the field, throughout its whole area, was made over 
GEN.23.18	to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the Hittites, before all who went in at the gate of his city. 
GEN.23.19	After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Mach-pelah east of Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.23.20	The field and the cave that is in it were made over to Abraham as a possession for a burying place by the Hittites.
GEN.24.1	Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years; and the 
GEN.24.2	And Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his house, who had charge of all that he had, “Put your hand under my thigh, 
GEN.24.3	and I will make you swear by the 
GEN.24.4	but will go to my country and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.” 
GEN.24.5	The servant said to him, “Perhaps the woman may not be willing to follow me to this land; must I then take your son back to the land from which you came?” 
GEN.24.6	Abraham said to him, “See to it that you do not take my son back there. 
GEN.24.7	The 
GEN.24.8	But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this oath of mine; only you must not take my son back there.” 
GEN.24.9	So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.
GEN.24.10	Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and departed, taking all sorts of choice gifts from his master; and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor. 
GEN.24.11	And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time when women go out to draw water. 
GEN.24.12	And he said, “O 
GEN.24.13	Behold, I am standing by the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water. 
GEN.24.14	Let the maiden to whom I shall say, ‘Pray let down your jar that I may drink,’ and who shall say, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels’—let her be the one whom thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac. By this I shall know that thou hast shown steadfast love to my master.”
GEN.24.15	Before he had done speaking, behold, Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, came out with her water jar upon her shoulder. 
GEN.24.16	The maiden was very fair to look upon, a virgin, whom no man had known. She went down to the spring, and filled her jar, and came up. 
GEN.24.17	Then the servant ran to meet her, and said, “Pray give me a little water to drink from your jar.” 
GEN.24.18	She said, “Drink, my lord”; and she quickly let down her jar upon her hand, and gave him a drink. 
GEN.24.19	When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will draw for your camels also, until they have done drinking.” 
GEN.24.20	So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw, and she drew for all his camels. 
GEN.24.21	The man gazed at her in silence to learn whether the 
GEN.24.22	When the camels had done drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing a half shekel, and two bracelets for her arms weighing ten gold shekels, 
GEN.24.23	and said, “Tell me whose daughter you are. Is there room in your father's house for us to lodge in?” 
GEN.24.24	She said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.” 
GEN.24.25	She added, “We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.” 
GEN.24.26	The man bowed his head and worshiped the 
GEN.24.27	and said, “Blessed be the 
GEN.24.28	Then the maiden ran and told her mother's household about these things. 
GEN.24.29	Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban; and Laban ran out to the man, to the spring. 
GEN.24.30	When he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister's arms, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, “Thus the man spoke to me,” he went to the man; and behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring. 
GEN.24.31	He said, “Come in, O blessed of the 
GEN.24.32	So the man came into the house; and Laban ungirded the camels, and gave him straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. 
GEN.24.33	Then food was set before him to eat; but he said, “I will not eat until I have told my errand.” He said, “Speak on.”
GEN.24.34	So he said, “I am Abraham's servant. 
GEN.24.35	The 
GEN.24.36	And Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master when she was old; and to him he has given all that he has. 
GEN.24.37	My master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell; 
GEN.24.38	but you shall go to my father's house and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son.’ 
GEN.24.39	I said to my master, ‘Perhaps the woman will not follow me.’ 
GEN.24.40	But he said to me, ‘The 
GEN.24.41	then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my kindred; and if they will not give her to you, you will be free from my oath.’
GEN.24.42	“I came today to the spring, and said, ‘O 
GEN.24.43	behold, I am standing by the spring of water; let the young woman who comes out to draw, to whom I shall say, “Pray give me a little water from your jar to drink,” 
GEN.24.44	and who will say to me, “Drink, and I will draw for your camels also,” let her be the woman whom the 
GEN.24.45	“Before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her water jar on her shoulder; and she went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, ‘Pray let me drink.’ 
GEN.24.46	She quickly let down her jar from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and I will give your camels drink also.’ So I drank, and she gave the camels drink also. 
GEN.24.47	Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ So I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her arms. 
GEN.24.48	Then I bowed my head and worshiped the 
GEN.24.49	Now then, if you will deal loyally and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.”
GEN.24.50	Then Laban and Bethuel answered, “The thing comes from the 
GEN.24.51	Behold, Rebekah is before you, take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master's son, as the 
GEN.24.52	When Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the earth before the 
GEN.24.53	And the servant brought forth jewelry of silver and of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave to her brother and to her mother costly ornaments. 
GEN.24.54	And he and the men who were with him ate and drank, and they spent the night there. When they arose in the morning, he said, “Send me back to my master.” 
GEN.24.55	Her brother and her mother said, “Let the maiden remain with us a while, at least ten days; after that she may go.” 
GEN.24.56	But he said to them, “Do not delay me, since the 
GEN.24.57	They said, “We will call the maiden, and ask her.” 
GEN.24.58	And they called Rebekah, and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” She said, “I will go.” 
GEN.24.59	So they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse, and Abraham's servant and his men. 
GEN.24.60	And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, “Our sister, be the mother of thousands of ten thousands; and may your descendants possess the gate of those who hate them!” 
GEN.24.61	Then Rebekah and her maids arose, and rode upon the camels and followed the man; thus the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
GEN.24.62	Now Isaac had come from
GEN.24.63	And Isaac went out to meditate in the field in the evening; and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, there were camels coming. 
GEN.24.64	And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel, 
GEN.24.65	and said to the servant, “Who is the man yonder, walking in the field to meet us?” The servant said, “It is my master.” So she took her veil and covered herself. 
GEN.24.66	And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. 
GEN.24.67	Then Isaac brought her into the tent,
GEN.25.1	Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah. 
GEN.25.2	She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 
GEN.25.3	Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Le-ummim. 
GEN.25.4	The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. 
GEN.25.5	Abraham gave all he had to Isaac. 
GEN.25.6	But to the sons of his concubines Abraham gave gifts, and while he was still living he sent them away from his son Isaac, eastward to the east country.
GEN.25.7	These are the days of the years of Abraham's life, a hundred and seventy-five years. 
GEN.25.8	Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an old man and full of years, and was gathered to his people. 
GEN.25.9	Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Mach-pelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, east of Mamre, 
GEN.25.10	the field which Abraham purchased from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried, with Sarah his wife. 
GEN.25.11	After the death of Abraham God blessed Isaac his son. And Isaac dwelt at Beer-lahai-roi.
GEN.25.12	These are the descendants of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's maid, bore to Abraham. 
GEN.25.13	 These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, named in the order of their birth: Nebaioth, the first-born of Ishmael; and Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 
GEN.25.14	Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 
GEN.25.15	Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 
GEN.25.16	These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names, by their villages and by their encampments, twelve princes according to their tribes. 
GEN.25.17	(These are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty-seven years; he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his kindred.) 
GEN.25.18	They dwelt from Havilah to Shur, which is opposite Egypt in the direction of Assyria; he settled
GEN.25.19	These are the descendants of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham was the father of Isaac, 
GEN.25.20	and Isaac was forty years old when he took to wife Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean. 
GEN.25.21	And Isaac prayed to the 
GEN.25.22	The children struggled together within her; and she said, “If it is thus, why do I live?”
GEN.25.23	And the 
GEN.25.23	“Two nations are in your womb,
GEN.25.23	and two peoples, born of you, shall be divided;
GEN.25.23	the one shall be stronger than the other,
GEN.25.23	the elder shall serve the younger.”
GEN.25.24	When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. 
GEN.25.25	The first came forth red, all his body like a hairy mantle; so they called his name Esau. 
GEN.25.26	Afterward his brother came forth, and his hand had taken hold of Esau's heel; so his name was called Jacob.
GEN.25.27	When the boys grew up, Esau was a skilful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents. 
GEN.25.28	Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his game; but Rebekah loved Jacob.
GEN.25.29	Once when Jacob was boiling pottage, Esau came in from the field, and he was famished. 
GEN.25.30	And Esau said to Jacob, “Let me eat some of that red pottage, for I am famished!” (Therefore his name was called Edom.
GEN.25.31	Jacob said, “First sell me your birthright.” 
GEN.25.32	Esau said, “I am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?” 
GEN.25.33	Jacob said, “Swear to me first.”
GEN.25.34	Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils, and he ate and drank, and rose and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.
GEN.26.1	Now there was a famine in the land, besides the former famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Gerar, to Abimelech king of the Philistines. 
GEN.26.2	And the 
GEN.26.3	Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you; for to you and to your descendants I will give all these lands, and I will fulfil the oath which I swore to Abraham your father. 
GEN.26.4	I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven, and will give to your descendants all these lands; and by your descendants all the nations of the earth shall bless themselves: 
GEN.26.5	because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.”
GEN.26.6	So Isaac dwelt in Gerar. 
GEN.26.7	When the men of the place asked him about his wife, he said, “She is my sister”; for he feared to say, “My wife,” thinking, “lest the men of the place should kill me for the sake of Rebekah”; because she was fair to look upon. 
GEN.26.8	When he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out of a window and saw Isaac fondling Rebekah his wife. 
GEN.26.9	So Abimelech called Isaac, and said, “Behold, she is your wife; how then could you say, ‘She is my sister’?” Isaac said to him, “Because I thought, ‘Lest I die because of her.’ ” 
GEN.26.10	Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.” 
GEN.26.11	So Abimelech warned all the people, saying, “Whoever touches this man or his wife shall be put to death.”
GEN.26.12	And Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year a hundredfold. The 
GEN.26.13	and the man became rich, and gained more and more until he became very wealthy. 
GEN.26.14	He had possessions of flocks and herds, and a great household, so that the Philistines envied him. 
GEN.26.15	(Now the Philistines had stopped and filled with earth all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father.) 
GEN.26.16	And Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us; for you are much mightier than we.”
GEN.26.17	So Isaac departed from there, and encamped in the valley of Gerar and dwelt there. 
GEN.26.18	And Isaac dug again the wells of water which had been dug in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham; and he gave them the names which his father had given them. 
GEN.26.19	But when Isaac's servants dug in the valley and found there a well of springing water, 
GEN.26.20	the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” So he called the name of the well Esek,
GEN.26.21	Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that also; so he called its name Sitnah.
GEN.26.22	And he moved from there and dug another well, and over that they did not quarrel; so he called its name Rehoboth,
GEN.26.23	From there he went up to Beer-sheba. 
GEN.26.24	And the 
GEN.26.25	So he built an altar there and called upon the name of the 
GEN.26.26	Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army. 
GEN.26.27	Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, seeing that you hate me and have sent me away from you?” 
GEN.26.28	They said, “We see plainly that the 
GEN.26.29	that you will do us no harm, just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the 
GEN.26.30	So he made them a feast, and they ate and drank. 
GEN.26.31	In the morning they rose early and took oath with one another; and Isaac set them on their way, and they departed from him in peace. 
GEN.26.32	That same day Isaac's servants came and told him about the well which they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water.” 
GEN.26.33	 He called it Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day.
GEN.26.34	When Esau was forty years old, he took to wife Judith the daughter of Be-eri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite; 
GEN.26.35	and they made life bitter for Isaac and Rebekah.
GEN.27.1	When Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, he called Esau his older son, and said to him, “My son”; and he answered, “Here I am.” 
GEN.27.2	He said, “Behold, I am old; I do not know the day of my death. 
GEN.27.3	Now then, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and hunt game for me, 
GEN.27.4	and prepare for me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat; that I may bless you before I die.”
GEN.27.6	Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “I heard your father speak to your brother Esau, 
GEN.27.7	‘Bring me game, and prepare for me savory food, that I may eat it, and bless you before the 
GEN.27.8	Now therefore, my son, obey my word as I command you. 
GEN.27.9	Go to the flock, and fetch me two good kids, that I may prepare from them savory food for your father, such as he loves; 
GEN.27.10	and you shall bring it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.” 
GEN.27.11	But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Behold, my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man. 
GEN.27.12	Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be mocking him, and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing.” 
GEN.27.13	His mother said to him, “Upon me be your curse, my son; only obey my word, and go, fetch them to me.” 
GEN.27.14	So he went and took them and brought them to his mother; and his mother prepared savory food, such as his father loved. 
GEN.27.15	Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her older son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son; 
GEN.27.16	and the skins of the kids she put upon his hands and upon the smooth part of his neck; 
GEN.27.17	and she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
GEN.27.18	So he went in to his father, and said, “My father”; and he said, “Here I am; who are you, my son?” 
GEN.27.19	Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your first-born. I have done as you told me; now sit up and eat of my game, that you may bless me.” 
GEN.27.20	But Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?” He answered, “Because the 
GEN.27.21	Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not.” 
GEN.27.22	So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, who felt him and said, “The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.” 
GEN.27.23	And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's hands; so he blessed him. 
GEN.27.24	He said, “Are you really my son Esau?” He answered, “I am.” 
GEN.27.25	Then he said, “Bring it to me, that I may eat of my son's game and bless you.” So he brought it to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank. 
GEN.27.26	Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come near and kiss me, my son.” 
GEN.27.27	So he came near and kissed him; and he smelled the smell of his garments, and blessed him, and said,
GEN.27.27	“See, the smell of my son
GEN.27.27	is as the smell of a field which the 
GEN.27.28	May God give you of the dew of heaven,
GEN.27.28	and of the fatness of the earth,
GEN.27.28	and plenty of grain and wine.
GEN.27.29	Let peoples serve you,
GEN.27.29	and nations bow down to you.
GEN.27.29	Be lord over your brothers,
GEN.27.29	and may your mother's sons bow down to you.
GEN.27.29	Cursed be every one who curses you,
GEN.27.29	and blessed be every one who blesses you!”
GEN.27.30	As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, when Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 
GEN.27.31	He also prepared savory food, and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, “Let my father arise, and eat of his son's game, that you may bless me.” 
GEN.27.32	His father Isaac said to him, “Who are you?” He answered, “I am your son, your first-born, Esau.” 
GEN.27.33	Then Isaac trembled violently, and said, “Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me, and I ate it all
GEN.27.34	When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, “Bless me, even me also, O my father!” 
GEN.27.35	But he said, “Your brother came with guile, and he has taken away your blessing.” 
GEN.27.36	Esau said, “Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright; and behold, now he has taken away my blessing.” Then he said, “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?” 
GEN.27.37	Isaac answered Esau, “Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. What then can I do for you, my son?” 
GEN.27.38	Esau said to his father, “Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father.” And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.
GEN.27.39	Then Isaac his father answered him:
GEN.27.39	“Behold, away from
GEN.27.39	and away from
GEN.27.40	By your sword you shall live,
GEN.27.40	and you shall serve your brother;
GEN.27.40	but when you break loose
GEN.27.40	you shall break his yoke from your neck.”
GEN.27.41	Now Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him, and Esau said to himself, “The days of mourning for my father are approaching; then I will kill my brother Jacob.” 
GEN.27.42	But the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah; so she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, “Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself by planning to kill you. 
GEN.27.43	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee to Laban my brother in Haran, 
GEN.27.44	and stay with him a while, until your brother's fury turns away; 
GEN.27.45	until your brother's anger turns away, and he forgets what you have done to him; then I will send, and fetch you from there. Why should I be bereft of you both in one day?”
GEN.27.46	Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am weary of my life because of the Hittite women. If Jacob marries one of the Hittite women such as these, one of the women of the land, what good will my life be to me?”
GEN.28.1	Then Isaac called Jacob and blessed him, and charged him, “You shall not marry one of the Canaanite women. 
GEN.28.2	Arise, go to Paddan-aram to the house of Bethuel your mother's father; and take as wife from there one of the daughters of Laban your mother's brother. 
GEN.28.3	God Almighty
GEN.28.4	May he give the blessing of Abraham to you and to your descendants with you, that you may take possession of the land of your sojournings which God gave to Abraham!” 
GEN.28.5	Thus Isaac sent Jacob away; and he went to Paddan-aram to Laban, the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
GEN.28.6	Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram to take a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he charged him, “You shall not marry one of the Canaanite women,” 
GEN.28.7	and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and gone to Paddan-aram. 
GEN.28.8	So when Esau saw that the Canaanite women did not please Isaac his father, 
GEN.28.9	Esau went to Ishmael and took to wife, besides the wives he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth.
GEN.28.10	Jacob left Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran. 
GEN.28.11	And he came to a certain place, and stayed there that night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep. 
GEN.28.12	And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it! 
GEN.28.13	And behold, the 
GEN.28.14	and your descendants shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and by you and your descendants shall all the families of the earth bless themselves.
GEN.28.15	Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done that of which I have spoken to you.” 
GEN.28.16	Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely the 
GEN.28.17	And he was afraid, and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”
GEN.28.18	So Jacob rose early in the morning, and he took the stone which he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. 
GEN.28.19	He called the name of that place Bethel;
GEN.28.20	Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear, 
GEN.28.21	so that I come again to my father's house in peace, then the 
GEN.28.22	and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house; and of all that thou givest me I will give the tenth to thee.”
GEN.29.1	Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the people of the east. 
GEN.29.2	As he looked, he saw a well in the field, and lo, three flocks of sheep lying beside it; for out of that well the flocks were watered. The stone on the well's mouth was large, 
GEN.29.3	and when all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone from the mouth of the well, and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place upon the mouth of the well.
GEN.29.4	Jacob said to them, “My brothers, where do you come from?” They said, “We are from Haran.” 
GEN.29.5	He said to them, “Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?” They said, “We know him.” 
GEN.29.6	He said to them, “Is it well with him?” They said, “It is well; and see, Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep!” 
GEN.29.7	He said, “Behold, it is still high day, it is not time for the animals to be gathered together; water the sheep, and go, pasture them.” 
GEN.29.8	But they said, “We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together, and the stone is rolled from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep.”
GEN.29.9	While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she kept them. 
GEN.29.10	Now when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, Jacob went up and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. 
GEN.29.11	Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and wept aloud. 
GEN.29.12	And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's kinsman, and that he was Rebekah's son; and she ran and told her father.
GEN.29.13	When Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, he ran to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things, 
GEN.29.14	and Laban said to him, “Surely you are my bone and my flesh!” And he stayed with him a month.
GEN.29.15	Then Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?” 
GEN.29.16	Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 
GEN.29.17	Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful and lovely. 
GEN.29.18	Jacob loved Rachel; and he said, “I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.” 
GEN.29.19	Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to any other man; stay with me.” 
GEN.29.20	So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he had for her.
GEN.29.21	Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my time is completed.” 
GEN.29.22	So Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. 
GEN.29.23	But in the evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob; and he went in to her. 
GEN.29.24	(Laban gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her maid.) 
GEN.29.25	And in the morning, behold, it was Leah; and Jacob said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?” 
GEN.29.26	Laban said, “It is not so done in our country, to give the younger before the first-born. 
GEN.29.27	Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also in return for serving me another seven years.” 
GEN.29.28	Jacob did so, and completed her week; then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to wife. 
GEN.29.29	(Laban gave his maid Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her maid.) 
GEN.29.30	So Jacob went in to Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah, and served Laban for another seven years.
GEN.29.31	When the 
GEN.29.32	And Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben;
GEN.29.33	She conceived again and bore a son, and said, “Because the 
GEN.29.34	Again she conceived and bore a son, and said, “Now this time my husband will be joined
GEN.29.35	And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, “This time I will praise
GEN.30.1	When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, she envied her sister; and she said to Jacob, “Give me children, or I shall die!” 
GEN.30.2	Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?” 
GEN.30.3	Then she said, “Here is my maid Bilhah; go in to her, that she may bear upon my knees, and even I may have children through her.” 
GEN.30.4	So she gave him her maid Bilhah as a wife; and Jacob went in to her. 
GEN.30.5	And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son. 
GEN.30.6	Then Rachel said, “God has judged me, and has also heard my voice and given me a son”; therefore she called his name Dan.
GEN.30.7	Rachel's maid Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son. 
GEN.30.8	Then Rachel said, “With mighty wrestlings I have wrestled
GEN.30.9	When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing children, she took her maid Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife. 
GEN.30.10	Then Leah's maid Zilpah bore Jacob a son. 
GEN.30.11	And Leah said, “Good fortune!” so she called his name Gad.
GEN.30.12	Leah's maid Zilpah bore Jacob a second son. 
GEN.30.13	And Leah said, “Happy am I! For the women will call me happy”; so she called his name Asher.
GEN.30.14	In the days of wheat harvest Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Give me, I pray, some of your son's mandrakes.” 
GEN.30.15	But she said to her, “Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son's mandrakes also?” Rachel said, “Then he may lie with you tonight for your son's mandrakes.” 
GEN.30.16	When Jacob came from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him, and said, “You must come in to me; for I have hired you with my son's mandrakes.” So he lay with her that night. 
GEN.30.17	And God hearkened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son. 
GEN.30.18	Leah said, “God has given me my hire
GEN.30.19	And Leah conceived again, and she bore Jacob a sixth son. 
GEN.30.20	Then Leah said, “God has endowed me with a good dowry; now my husband will honor
GEN.30.21	Afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah. 
GEN.30.22	Then God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her and opened her womb. 
GEN.30.23	She conceived and bore a son, and said, “God has taken away my reproach”; 
GEN.30.24	and she called his name Joseph,
GEN.30.25	When Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away, that I may go to my own home and country. 
GEN.30.26	Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know the service which I have given you.” 
GEN.30.27	But Laban said to him, “If you will allow me to say so, I have learned by divination that the 
GEN.30.28	name your wages, and I will give it.” 
GEN.30.29	Jacob said to him, “You yourself know how I have served you, and how your cattle have fared with me. 
GEN.30.30	For you had little before I came, and it has increased abundantly; and the 
GEN.30.31	He said, “What shall I give you?” Jacob said, “You shall not give me anything; if you will do this for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it: 
GEN.30.32	let me pass through all your flock today, removing from it every speckled and spotted sheep and every black lamb, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and such shall be my wages. 
GEN.30.33	So my honesty will answer for me later, when you come to look into my wages with you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs, if found with me, shall be counted stolen.” 
GEN.30.34	Laban said, “Good! Let it be as you have said.” 
GEN.30.35	But that day Laban removed the he-goats that were striped and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white on it, and every lamb that was black, and put them in charge of his sons; 
GEN.30.36	and he set a distance of three days' journey between himself and Jacob; and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flock.
GEN.30.37	Then Jacob took fresh rods of poplar and almond and plane, and peeled white streaks in them, exposing the white of the rods. 
GEN.30.38	He set the rods which he had peeled in front of the flocks in the runnels, that is, the watering troughs, where the flocks came to drink. And since they bred when they came to drink, 
GEN.30.39	the flocks bred in front of the rods and so the flocks brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted. 
GEN.30.40	And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban; and he put his own droves apart, and did not put them with Laban's flock. 
GEN.30.41	Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding Jacob laid the rods in the runnels before the eyes of the flock, that they might breed among the rods, 
GEN.30.42	but for the feebler of the flock he did not lay them there; so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's. 
GEN.30.43	Thus the man grew exceedingly rich, and had large flocks, maidservants and menservants, and camels and asses.
GEN.31.1	Now Jacob heard that the sons of Laban were saying, “Jacob has taken all that was our father's; and from what was our father's he has gained all this wealth.” 
GEN.31.2	And Jacob saw that Laban did not regard him with favor as before. 
GEN.31.3	Then the 
GEN.31.4	So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field where his flock was, 
GEN.31.5	and said to them, “I see that your father does not regard me with favor as he did before. But the God of my father has been with me. 
GEN.31.6	You know that I have served your father with all my strength; 
GEN.31.7	yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times, but God did not permit him to harm me. 
GEN.31.8	If he said, ‘The spotted shall be your wages,’ then all the flock bore spotted; and if he said, ‘The striped shall be your wages,’ then all the flock bore striped. 
GEN.31.9	Thus God has taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me. 
GEN.31.10	In the mating season of the flock I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream that the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were striped, spotted, and mottled. 
GEN.31.11	Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob,’ and I said, ‘Here I am!’ 
GEN.31.12	And he said, ‘Lift up your eyes and see, all the goats that leap upon the flock are striped, spotted, and mottled; for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you. 
GEN.31.13	I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Now arise, go forth from this land, and return to the land of your birth.’ ” 
GEN.31.14	Then Rachel and Leah answered him, “Is there any portion or inheritance left to us in our father's house? 
GEN.31.15	Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and he has been using up the money given for us. 
GEN.31.16	All the property which God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children; now then, whatever God has said to you, do.”
GEN.31.17	So Jacob arose, and set his sons and his wives on camels; 
GEN.31.18	and he drove away all his cattle, all his livestock which he had gained, the cattle in his possession which he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac. 
GEN.31.19	Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole her father's household gods. 
GEN.31.20	And Jacob outwitted Laban the Aramean, in that he did not tell him that he intended to flee. 
GEN.31.21	He fled with all that he had, and arose and crossed the Euphrates, and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.
GEN.31.22	When it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled, 
GEN.31.23	he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him for seven days and followed close after him into the hill country of Gilead. 
GEN.31.24	But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night, and said to him, “Take heed that you say not a word to Jacob, either good or bad.”
GEN.31.25	And Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsmen encamped in the hill country of Gilead. 
GEN.31.26	And Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done, that you have cheated me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword? 
GEN.31.27	Why did you flee secretly, and cheat me, and did not tell me, so that I might have sent you away with mirth and songs, with tambourine and lyre? 
GEN.31.28	And why did you not permit me to kiss my sons and my daughters farewell? Now you have done foolishly. 
GEN.31.29	It is in my power to do you harm; but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, ‘Take heed that you speak to Jacob neither good nor bad.’ 
GEN.31.30	And now you have gone away because you longed greatly for your father's house, but why did you steal my gods?” 
GEN.31.31	Jacob answered Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force. 
GEN.31.32	Any one with whom you find your gods shall not live. In the presence of our kinsmen point out what I have that is yours, and take it.” Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.
GEN.31.33	So Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two maidservants, but he did not find them. And he went out of Leah's tent, and entered Rachel's. 
GEN.31.34	Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in the camel's saddle, and sat upon them. Laban felt all about the tent, but did not find them. 
GEN.31.35	And she said to her father, “Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for the way of women is upon me.” So he searched, but did not find the household gods.
GEN.31.36	Then Jacob became angry, and upbraided Laban; Jacob said to Laban, “What is my offense? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me? 
GEN.31.37	Although you have felt through all my goods, what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen, that they may decide between us two. 
GEN.31.38	These twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and your she-goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flocks. 
GEN.31.39	That which was torn by wild beasts I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it myself; of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. 
GEN.31.40	Thus I was; by day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes. 
GEN.31.41	These twenty years I have been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times. 
GEN.31.42	If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been on my side, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God saw my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.”
GEN.31.43	Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne? 
GEN.31.44	Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I; and let it be a witness between you and me.” 
GEN.31.45	So Jacob took a stone, and set it up as a pillar. 
GEN.31.46	And Jacob said to his kinsmen, “Gather stones,” and they took stones, and made a heap; and they ate there by the heap. 
GEN.31.47	Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha:
GEN.31.48	Laban said, “This heap is a witness between you and me today.” Therefore he named it Galeed, 
GEN.31.49	and the pillar
GEN.31.50	If you ill-treat my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no man is with us, remember, God is witness between you and me.”
GEN.31.51	Then Laban said to Jacob, “See this heap and the pillar, which I have set between you and me. 
GEN.31.52	This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm. 
GEN.31.53	The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac, 
GEN.31.54	and Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and called his kinsmen to eat bread; and they ate bread and tarried all night on the mountain.
GEN.32.1	Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met him; 
GEN.32.2	and when Jacob saw them he said, “This is God's army!” So he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
GEN.32.3	And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother in the land of Seir, the country of Edom, 
GEN.32.4	instructing them, “Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob, ‘I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now; 
GEN.32.5	and I have oxen, asses, flocks, menservants, and maidservants; and I have sent to tell my lord, in order that I may find favor in your sight.’ ”
GEN.32.6	And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother Esau, and he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men with him.” 
GEN.32.7	Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two companies, 
GEN.32.8	thinking, “If Esau comes to the one company and destroys it, then the company which is left will escape.”
GEN.32.9	And Jacob said, “O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O 
GEN.32.10	I am not worthy of the least of all the steadfast love and all the faithfulness which thou hast shown to thy servant, for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan; and now I have become two companies. 
GEN.32.11	Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, lest he come and slay us all, the mothers with the children. 
GEN.32.12	But thou didst say, ‘I will do you good, and make your descendants as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ ”
GEN.32.13	So he lodged there that night, and took from what he had with him a present for his brother Esau, 
GEN.32.14	two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, 
GEN.32.15	thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten he-asses. 
GEN.32.16	These he delivered into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, “Pass on before me, and put a space between drove and drove.” 
GEN.32.17	He instructed the foremost, “When Esau my brother meets you, and asks you, ‘To whom do you belong? Where are you going? And whose are these before you?’ 
GEN.32.18	then you shall say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob; they are a present sent to my lord Esau; and moreover he is behind us.’ ” 
GEN.32.19	He likewise instructed the second and the third and all who followed the droves, “You shall say the same thing to Esau when you meet him, 
GEN.32.20	and you shall say, ‘Moreover your servant Jacob is behind us.’ ” For he thought, “I may appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterwards I shall see his face; perhaps he will accept me.” 
GEN.32.21	So the present passed on before him; and he himself lodged that night in the camp.
GEN.32.22	The same night he arose and took his two wives, his two maids, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. 
GEN.32.23	He took them and sent them across the stream, and likewise everything that he had. 
GEN.32.24	And Jacob was left alone; and a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day. 
GEN.32.25	When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and Jacob's thigh was put out of joint as he wrestled with him. 
GEN.32.26	Then he said, “Let me go, for the day is breaking.” But Jacob said, “I will not let you go, unless you bless me.” 
GEN.32.27	And he said to him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Jacob.” 
GEN.32.28	Then he said, “Your name shall no more be called Jacob, but Israel,
GEN.32.29	Then Jacob asked him, “Tell me, I pray, your name.” But he said, “Why is it that you ask my name?” And there he blessed him. 
GEN.32.30	So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel,
GEN.32.31	The sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, limping because of his thigh. 
GEN.32.32	Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh on the sinew of the hip.
GEN.33.1	And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau was coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two maids. 
GEN.33.2	And he put the maids with their children in front, then Leah with her children, and Rachel and Joseph last of all. 
GEN.33.3	He himself went on before them, bowing himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
GEN.33.4	But Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept. 
GEN.33.5	And when Esau raised his eyes and saw the women and children, he said, “Who are these with you?” Jacob said, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.” 
GEN.33.6	Then the maids drew near, they and their children, and bowed down; 
GEN.33.7	Leah likewise and her children drew near and bowed down; and last Joseph and Rachel drew near, and they bowed down. 
GEN.33.8	Esau said, “What do you mean by all this company which I met?” Jacob answered, “To find favor in the sight of my lord.” 
GEN.33.9	But Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for yourself.” 
GEN.33.10	Jacob said, “No, I pray you, if I have found favor in your sight, then accept my present from my hand; for truly to see your face is like seeing the face of God, with such favor have you received me. 
GEN.33.11	Accept, I pray you, my gift that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.” Thus he urged him, and he took it.
GEN.33.12	Then Esau said, “Let us journey on our way, and I will go before you.” 
GEN.33.13	But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are frail, and that the flocks and herds giving suck are a care to me; and if they are overdriven for one day, all the flocks will die. 
GEN.33.14	Let my lord pass on before his servant, and I will lead on slowly, according to the pace of the cattle which are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.”
GEN.33.15	So Esau said, “Let me leave with you some of the men who are with me.” But he said, “What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.” 
GEN.33.16	So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir. 
GEN.33.17	But Jacob journeyed to Succoth,
GEN.33.18	And Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, on his way from Paddan-aram; and he camped before the city. 
GEN.33.19	And from the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, he bought for a hundred pieces of money
GEN.33.20	There he erected an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel.
GEN.34.1	Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the women of the land; 
GEN.34.2	and when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he seized her and lay with her and humbled her. 
GEN.34.3	And his soul was drawn to Dinah the daughter of Jacob; he loved the maiden and spoke tenderly to her. 
GEN.34.4	So Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, “Get me this maiden for my wife.” 
GEN.34.5	Now Jacob heard that he had defiled his daughter Dinah; but his sons were with his cattle in the field, so Jacob held his peace until they came. 
GEN.34.6	And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him. 
GEN.34.7	The sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard of it; and the men were indignant and very angry, because he had wrought folly in Israel by lying with Jacob's daughter, for such a thing ought not to be done.
GEN.34.8	But Hamor spoke with them, saying, “The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter; I pray you, give her to him in marriage. 
GEN.34.9	Make marriages with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves. 
GEN.34.10	You shall dwell with us; and the land shall be open to you; dwell and trade in it, and get property in it.” 
GEN.34.11	Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will give. 
GEN.34.12	Ask of me ever so much as marriage present and gift, and I will give according as you say to me; only give me the maiden to be my wife.”
GEN.34.13	The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully, because he had defiled their sister Dinah. 
GEN.34.14	They said to them, “We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us. 
GEN.34.15	Only on this condition will we consent to you: that you will become as we are and every male of you be circumcised. 
GEN.34.16	Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to ourselves, and we will dwell with you and become one people. 
GEN.34.17	But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter, and we will be gone.”
GEN.34.18	Their words pleased Hamor and Hamor's son Shechem. 
GEN.34.19	And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter. Now he was the most honored of all his family. 
GEN.34.20	So Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying, 
GEN.34.21	“These men are friendly with us; let them dwell in the land and trade in it, for behold, the land is large enough for them; let us take their daughters in marriage, and let us give them our daughters. 
GEN.34.22	Only on this condition will the men agree to dwell with us, to become one people: that every male among us be circumcised as they are circumcised. 
GEN.34.23	Will not their cattle, their property and all their beasts be ours? Only let us agree with them, and they will dwell with us.” 
GEN.34.24	And all who went out of the gate of his city hearkened to Hamor and his son Shechem; and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.
GEN.34.25	On the third day, when they were sore, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and came upon the city unawares, and killed all the males. 
GEN.34.26	They slew Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went away. 
GEN.34.27	And the sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because their sister had been defiled; 
GEN.34.28	they took their flocks and their herds, their asses, and whatever was in the city and in the field; 
GEN.34.29	all their wealth, all their little ones and their wives, all that was in the houses, they captured and made their prey. 
GEN.34.30	Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble on me by making me odious to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites; my numbers are few, and if they gather themselves against me and attack me, I shall be destroyed, both I and my household.” 
GEN.34.31	But they said, “Should he treat our sister as a harlot?”
GEN.35.1	God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there; and make there an altar to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.” 
GEN.35.2	So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments; 
GEN.35.3	then let us arise and go up to Bethel, that I may make there an altar to the God who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone.” 
GEN.35.4	So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was near Shechem.
GEN.35.5	And as they journeyed, a terror from God fell upon the cities that were round about them, so that they did not pursue the sons of Jacob. 
GEN.35.6	And Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him, 
GEN.35.7	and there he built an altar, and called the place El-bethel,
GEN.35.8	And Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried under an oak below Bethel; so the name of it was called Allon-bacuth.
GEN.35.9	God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him. 
GEN.35.10	And God said to him, “Your name is Jacob; no longer shall your name be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name.” So his name was called Israel. 
GEN.35.11	And God said to him, “I am God Almighty:
GEN.35.12	The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your descendants after you.” 
GEN.35.13	Then God went up from him in the place where he had spoken with him. 
GEN.35.14	And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone; and he poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it. 
GEN.35.15	So Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him, Bethel.
GEN.35.16	Then they journeyed from Bethel; and when they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor. 
GEN.35.17	And when she was in her hard labor, the midwife said to her, “Fear not; for now you will have another son.” 
GEN.35.18	And as her soul was departing (for she died), she called his name Ben-oni;
GEN.35.19	So Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem), 
GEN.35.20	and Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave; it is the pillar of Rachel's tomb, which is there to this day. 
GEN.35.21	Israel journeyed on, and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
GEN.35.22	While Israel dwelt in that land Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine; and Israel heard of it.
GEN.35.22	Now the sons of Jacob were twelve. 
GEN.35.23	The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob's first-born), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. 
GEN.35.24	The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. 
GEN.35.25	The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's maid: Dan and Naphtali. 
GEN.35.26	The sons of Zilpah, Leah's maid: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram.
GEN.35.27	And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned. 
GEN.35.28	Now the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years. 
GEN.35.29	And Isaac breathed his last; and he died and was gathered to his people, old and full of days; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
GEN.36.1	These are the descendants of Esau (that is, Edom). 
GEN.36.2	 Esau took his wives from the Canaanites: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, Oholibamah the daughter of Anah the son
GEN.36.3	and Basemath, Ishmael's daughter, the sister of Nebaioth. 
GEN.36.4	And Adah bore to Esau, Eliphaz; Basemath bore Reuel; 
GEN.36.5	and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
GEN.36.6	Then Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the members of his household, his cattle, all his beasts, and all his property which he had acquired in the land of Canaan; and he went into a land away from his brother Jacob. 
GEN.36.7	For their possessions were too great for them to dwell together; the land of their sojournings could not support them because of their cattle. 
GEN.36.8	So Esau dwelt in the hill country of Seir; Esau is Edom.
GEN.36.9	These are the descendants of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir. 
GEN.36.10	These are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau. 
GEN.36.11	The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz. 
GEN.36.12	(Timna was a concubine of Eliphaz, Esau's son; she bore Amalek to Eliphaz.) These are the sons of Adah, Esau's wife. 
GEN.36.13	These are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These are the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife. 
GEN.36.14	These are the sons of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah the son
GEN.36.15	These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau. The sons of Eliphaz the first-born of Esau: the chiefs Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz, 
GEN.36.16	Korah, Gatam, and Amalek; these are the chiefs of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; they are the sons of Adah. 
GEN.36.17	These are the sons of Reuel, Esau's son: the chiefs Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah; these are the chiefs of Reuel in the land of Edom; they are the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife. 
GEN.36.18	These are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau's wife: the chiefs Jeush, Jalam, and Korah; these are the chiefs born of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife. 
GEN.36.19	These are the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these are their chiefs.
GEN.36.21	Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan; these are the chiefs of the Horites, the sons of Seir in the land of Edom. 
GEN.36.22	The sons of Lotan were Hori and Heman; and Lotan's sister was Timna. 
GEN.36.23	These are the sons of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. 
GEN.36.24	These are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah; he is the Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness, as he pastured the asses of Zibeon his father. 
GEN.36.25	These are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah. 
GEN.36.26	These are the sons of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran. 
GEN.36.27	These are the sons of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan. 
GEN.36.28	These are the sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran. 
GEN.36.29	These are the chiefs of the Horites: the chiefs Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 
GEN.36.30	Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan; these are the chiefs of the Horites, according to their clans in the land of Seir.
GEN.36.32	Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, the name of his city being Dinhabah. 
GEN.36.33	Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead. 
GEN.36.34	Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his stead. 
GEN.36.35	Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the country of Moab, reigned in his stead, the name of his city being Avith. 
GEN.36.36	Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead. 
GEN.36.37	Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth on the Euphrates reigned in his stead. 
GEN.36.38	Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead. 
GEN.36.39	Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead, the name of his city being Pau; his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, daughter of Mezahab.
GEN.36.40	These are the names of the chiefs of Esau, according to their families and their dwelling places, by their names: the chiefs Timna, Alvah, Jetheth, 
GEN.36.41	Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon, 
GEN.36.42	Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar, 
GEN.36.43	Magdiel, and Iram; these are the chiefs of Edom (that is, Esau, the father of Edom), according to their dwelling places in the land of their possession.
GEN.37.1	Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's sojournings, in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.37.2	This is the history of the family of Jacob.
GEN.37.2	Joseph, being seventeen years old, was shepherding the flock with his brothers; he was a lad with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives; and Joseph brought an ill report of them to their father. 
GEN.37.3	Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a long robe with sleeves. 
GEN.37.4	But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.
GEN.37.5	Now Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers they only hated him the more. 
GEN.37.6	He said to them, “Hear this dream which I have dreamed: 
GEN.37.7	behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf arose and stood upright; and behold, your sheaves gathered round it, and bowed down to my sheaf.” 
GEN.37.8	His brothers said to him, “Are you indeed to reign over us? Or are you indeed to have dominion over us?” So they hated him yet more for his dreams and for his words. 
GEN.37.9	Then he dreamed another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, “Behold, I have dreamed another dream; and behold, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.” 
GEN.37.10	But when he told it to his father and to his brothers, his father rebuked him, and said to him, “What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves to the ground before you?” 
GEN.37.11	 And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind.
GEN.37.12	Now his brothers went to pasture their father's flock near Shechem. 
GEN.37.13	And Israel said to Joseph, “Are not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem? Come, I will send you to them.” And he said to him, “Here I am.” 
GEN.37.14	So he said to him, “Go now, see if it is well with your brothers, and with the flock; and bring me word again.” So he sent him from the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. 
GEN.37.15	And a man found him wandering in the fields; and the man asked him, “What are seeking?” 
GEN.37.16	“I am seeking my brothers,” he said, “tell me, I pray you, where they are pasturing the flock.” 
GEN.37.17	And the man said, “They have gone away, for I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’ ” So Joseph went after his brothers, and found them at Dothan. 
GEN.37.18	They saw him afar off, and before he came near to them they conspired against him to kill him. 
GEN.37.19	They said to one another, “Here comes this dreamer. 
GEN.37.20	Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits; then we shall say that a wild beast has devoured him, and we shall see what will become of his dreams.” 
GEN.37.21	But when Reuben heard it, he delivered him out of their hands, saying, “Let us not take his life.” 
GEN.37.22	And Reuben said to them, “Shed no blood; cast him into this pit here in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him”—that he might rescue him out of their hand, to restore him to his father. 
GEN.37.23	So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe, the long robe with sleeves that he wore; 
GEN.37.24	and they took him and cast him into a pit. The pit was empty, there was no water in it.
GEN.37.25	Then they sat down to eat; and looking up they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing gum, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry it down to Egypt. 
GEN.37.26	Then Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood? 
GEN.37.27	Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our own flesh.” And his brothers heeded him. 
GEN.37.28	Then Midianite traders passed by; and they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver; and they took Joseph to Egypt.
GEN.37.29	When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he rent his clothes 
GEN.37.30	and returned to his brothers, and said, “The lad is gone; and I, where shall I go?” 
GEN.37.31	Then they took Joseph's robe, and killed a goat, and dipped the robe in the blood; 
GEN.37.32	and they sent the long robe with sleeves and brought it to their father, and said, “This we have found; see now whether it is your son's robe or not.” 
GEN.37.33	And he recognized it, and said, “It is my son's robe; a wild beast has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn to pieces.” 
GEN.37.34	Then Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days. 
GEN.37.35	All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted, and said, “No, I shall go down to Sheol to my son, mourning.” Thus his father wept for him. 
GEN.37.36	Meanwhile the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Poti-phar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard.
GEN.38.1	It happened at that time that Judah went down from his brothers, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. 
GEN.38.2	There Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua; he married her and went in to her, 
GEN.38.3	and she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er. 
GEN.38.4	Again she conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Onan. 
GEN.38.5	Yet again she bore a son, and she called his name Shelah. She
GEN.38.6	And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, and her name was Tamar. 
GEN.38.7	But Er, Judah's first-born, was wicked in the sight of the 
GEN.38.8	Then Judah said to Onan, “Go in to your brother's wife, and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.” 
GEN.38.9	But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so when he went in to his brother's wife he spilled the semen on the ground, lest he should give offspring to his brother. 
GEN.38.10	And what he did was displeasing in the sight of the 
GEN.38.11	Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow in your father's house, till Shelah my son grows up”—for he feared that he would die, like his brothers. So Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.
GEN.38.12	In course of time the wife of Judah, Shua's daughter, died; and when Judah was comforted, he went up to Timnah to his sheepshearers, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. 
GEN.38.13	And when Tamar was told, “Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep,” 
GEN.38.14	she put off her widow's garments, and put on a veil, wrapping herself up, and sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she had not been given to him in marriage. 
GEN.38.15	When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot, for she had covered her face. 
GEN.38.16	He went over to her at the road side, and said, “Come, let me come in to you,” for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. She said, “What will you give me, that you may come in to me?” 
GEN.38.17	He answered, “I will send you a kid from the flock.” And she said, “Will you give me a pledge, till you send it?” 
GEN.38.18	He said, “What pledge shall I give you?” She replied, “Your signet and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand.” So he gave them to her, and went in to her, and she conceived by him. 
GEN.38.19	Then she arose and went away, and taking off her veil she put on the garments of her widowhood.
GEN.38.20	When Judah sent the kid by his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand, he could not find her. 
GEN.38.21	And he asked the men of the place, “Where is the harlot
GEN.38.22	So he returned to Judah, and said, “I have not found her; and also the men of the place said, ‘No harlot
GEN.38.23	And Judah replied, “Let her keep the things as her own, lest we be laughed at; you see, I sent this kid, and you could not find her.”
GEN.38.24	About three months later Judah was told, “Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot; and moreover she is with child by harlotry.” And Judah said, “Bring her out, and let her be burned.” 
GEN.38.25	As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law, “By the man to whom these belong, I am with child.” And she said, “Mark, I pray you, whose these are, the signet and the cord and the staff.” 
GEN.38.26	Then Judah acknowledged them and said, “She is more righteous than I, inasmuch as I did not give her to my son Shelah.” And he did not lie with her again.
GEN.38.27	When the time of her delivery came, there were twins in her womb. 
GEN.38.28	And when she was in labor, one put out a hand; and the midwife took and bound on his hand a scarlet thread, saying, “This came out first.” 
GEN.38.29	But as he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out; and she said, “What a breach you have made for yourself!” Therefore his name was called Perez.
GEN.38.30	Afterward his brother came out with the scarlet thread upon his hand; and his name was called Zerah.
GEN.39.2	The 
GEN.39.3	and his master saw that the 
GEN.39.4	So Joseph found favor in his sight and attended him, and he made him overseer of his house and put him in charge of all that he had. 
GEN.39.5	From the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had the 
GEN.39.6	So he left all that he had in Joseph's charge; and having him he had no concern for anything but the food which he ate.
GEN.39.6	Now Joseph was handsome and good-looking. 
GEN.39.7	And after a time his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph, and said, “Lie with me.” 
GEN.39.8	But he refused and said to his master's wife, “Lo, having me my master has no concern about anything in the house, and he has put everything that he has in my hand; 
GEN.39.9	he is not greater in this house than I am; nor has he kept back anything from me except yourself, because you are his wife; how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?” 
GEN.39.10	And although she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not listen to her, to lie with her or to be with her. 
GEN.39.11	But one day, when he went into the house to do his work and none of the men of the house was there in the house, 
GEN.39.12	she caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me.” But he left his garment in her hand, and fled and got out of the house. 
GEN.39.13	And when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had fled out of the house, 
GEN.39.14	she called to the men of her household and said to them, “See, he has brought among us a Hebrew to insult us; he came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice; 
GEN.39.15	and when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment with me, and fled and got out of the house.” 
GEN.39.16	Then she laid up his garment by her until his master came home, 
GEN.39.17	and she told him the same story, saying, “The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought among us, came in to me to insult me; 
GEN.39.18	but as soon as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment with me, and fled out of the house.”
GEN.39.19	When his master heard the words which his wife spoke to him, “This is the way your servant treated me,” his anger was kindled. 
GEN.39.20	And Joseph's master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined, and he was there in prison. 
GEN.39.21	But the 
GEN.39.22	And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's care all the prisoners who were in the prison; and whatever was done there, he was the doer of it; 
GEN.39.23	the keeper of the prison paid no heed to anything that was in Joseph's care, because the 
GEN.40.1	Some time after this, the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of Egypt. 
GEN.40.2	And Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief butler and the chief baker, 
GEN.40.3	and he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison where Joseph was confined. 
GEN.40.4	The captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he waited on them; and they continued for some time in custody. 
GEN.40.5	And one night they both dreamed—the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison—each his own dream, and each dream with its own meaning. 
GEN.40.6	When Joseph came to them in the morning and saw them, they were troubled. 
GEN.40.7	So he asked Pharaoh's officers who were with him in custody in his master's house, “Why are your faces downcast today?” 
GEN.40.8	They said to him, “We have had dreams, and there is no one to interpret them.” And Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell them to me, I pray you.”
GEN.40.9	So the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “In my dream there was a vine before me, 
GEN.40.10	and on the vine there were three branches; as soon as it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters ripened into grapes. 
GEN.40.11	Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand.” 
GEN.40.12	Then Joseph said to him, “This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days; 
GEN.40.13	within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office; and you shall place Pharaoh's cup in his hand as formerly, when you were his butler. 
GEN.40.14	But remember me, when it is well with you, and do me the kindness, I pray you, to make mention of me to Pharaoh, and so get me out of this house. 
GEN.40.15	For I was indeed stolen out of the land of the Hebrews; and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.”
GEN.40.16	When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, “I also had a dream: there were three cake baskets on my head, 
GEN.40.17	and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head.” 
GEN.40.18	And Joseph answered, “This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days; 
GEN.40.19	within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head—from you!—and hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat the flesh from you.”
GEN.40.20	On the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, he made a feast for all his servants, and lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants. 
GEN.40.21	He restored the chief butler to his butlership, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand; 
GEN.40.22	but he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them. 
GEN.40.23	Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.
GEN.41.1	After two whole years, Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile, 
GEN.41.2	and behold, there came up out of the Nile seven cows sleek and fat, and they fed in the reed grass. 
GEN.41.3	And behold, seven other cows, gaunt and thin, came up out of the Nile after them, and stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile. 
GEN.41.4	And the gaunt and thin cows ate up the seven sleek and fat cows. And Pharaoh awoke. 
GEN.41.5	And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven ears of grain, plump and good, were growing on one stalk. 
GEN.41.6	And behold, after them sprouted seven ears, thin and blighted by the east wind. 
GEN.41.7	And the thin ears swallowed up the seven plump and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream. 
GEN.41.8	So in the morning his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men; and Pharaoh told them his dream, but there was none who could interpret it
GEN.41.9	Then the chief butler said to Pharaoh, “I remember my faults today. 
GEN.41.10	When Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me and the chief baker in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, 
GEN.41.11	we dreamed on the same night, he and I, each having a dream with its own meaning. 
GEN.41.12	A young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard; and when we told him, he interpreted our dreams to us, giving an interpretation to each man according to his dream. 
GEN.41.13	And as he interpreted to us, so it came to pass; I was restored to my office, and the baker was hanged.”
GEN.41.14	Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came in before Pharaoh. 
GEN.41.15	And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it; and I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.” 
GEN.41.16	Joseph answered Pharaoh, “It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer.” 
GEN.41.17	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Behold, in my dream I was standing on the banks of the Nile; 
GEN.41.18	and seven cows, fat and sleek, came up out of the Nile and fed in the reed grass; 
GEN.41.19	and seven other cows came up after them, poor and very gaunt and thin, such as I had never seen in all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.20	And the thin and gaunt cows ate up the first seven fat cows, 
GEN.41.21	but when they had eaten them no one would have known that they had eaten them, for they were still as gaunt as at the beginning. Then I awoke. 
GEN.41.22	I also saw in my dream seven ears growing on one stalk, full and good; 
GEN.41.23	and seven ears, withered, thin, and blighted by the east wind, sprouted after them, 
GEN.41.24	and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.”
GEN.41.25	Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dream of Pharaoh is one; God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do. 
GEN.41.26	The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dream is one. 
GEN.41.27	The seven lean and gaunt cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears blighted by the east wind are also seven years of famine. 
GEN.41.28	It is as I told Pharaoh, God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do. 
GEN.41.29	There will come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt, 
GEN.41.30	but after them there will arise seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt; the famine will consume the land, 
GEN.41.31	and the plenty will be unknown in the land by reason of that famine which will follow, for it will be very grievous. 
GEN.41.32	And the doubling of Pharaoh's dream means that the thing is fixed by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass. 
GEN.41.33	Now therefore let Pharaoh select a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.34	Let Pharaoh proceed to appoint overseers over the land, and take the fifth part of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven plenteous years. 
GEN.41.35	And let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming, and lay up grain under the authority of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it. 
GEN.41.36	That food shall be a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine which are to befall the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through the famine.”
GEN.41.37	This proposal seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his servants. 
GEN.41.38	 And Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find such a man as this, in whom is the Spirit of God?” 
GEN.41.39	So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has shown you all this, there is none so discreet and wise as you are; 
GEN.41.40	you shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command; only as regards the throne will I be greater than you.” 
GEN.41.41	And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.” 
GEN.41.42	Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in garments of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; 
GEN.41.43	and he made him to ride in his second chariot; and they cried before him, “Bow the knee!”
GEN.41.44	Moreover Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no man shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.” 
GEN.41.45	And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him in marriage Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On. So Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.
GEN.41.46	Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went through all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.47	During the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth abundantly, 
GEN.41.48	and he gathered up all the food of the seven years when there was plenty
GEN.41.49	And Joseph stored up grain in great abundance, like the sand of the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured.
GEN.41.50	Before the year of famine came, Joseph had two sons, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him. 
GEN.41.51	Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh,
GEN.41.52	The name of the second he called Ephraim,
GEN.41.53	The seven years of plenty that prevailed in the land of Egypt came to an end; 
GEN.41.54	 and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. 
GEN.41.55	When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph; what he says to you, do.” 
GEN.41.56	So when the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses,
GEN.41.57	Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth.
GEN.42.1	When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why do you look at one another?” 
GEN.42.2	 And he said, “Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down and buy grain for us there, that we may live, and not die.” 
GEN.42.3	So ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt. 
GEN.42.4	But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with his brothers, for he feared that harm might befall him. 
GEN.42.5	 Thus the sons of Israel came to buy among the others who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
GEN.42.6	Now Joseph was governor over the land; he it was who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brothers came, and bowed themselves before him with their faces to the ground. 
GEN.42.7	Joseph saw his brothers, and knew them, but he treated them like strangers and spoke roughly to them. “Where do you come from?” he said. They said, “From the land of Canaan, to buy food.” 
GEN.42.8	Thus Joseph knew his brothers, but they did not know him. 
GEN.42.9	And Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed of them; and he said to them, “You are spies, you have come to see the weakness of the land.” 
GEN.42.10	They said to him, “No, my lord, but to buy food have your servants come. 
GEN.42.11	We are all sons of one man, we are honest men, your servants are not spies.” 
GEN.42.12	He said to them, “No, it is the weakness of the land that you have come to see.” 
GEN.42.13	And they said, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is no more.” 
GEN.42.14	But Joseph said to them, “It is as I said to you, you are spies. 
GEN.42.15	By this you shall be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go from this place unless your youngest brother comes here. 
GEN.42.16	Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, while you remain in prison, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you; or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies.” 
GEN.42.17	And he put them all together in prison for three days.
GEN.42.18	On the third day Joseph said to them, “Do this and you will live, for I fear God: 
GEN.42.19	if you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain confined in your prison, and let the rest go and carry grain for the famine of your households, 
GEN.42.20	and bring your youngest brother to me; so your words will be verified, and you shall not die.” And they did so. 
GEN.42.21	Then they said to one another, “In truth we are guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us and we would not listen; therefore is this distress come upon us.” 
GEN.42.22	And Reuben answered them, “Did I not tell you not to sin against the lad? But you would not listen. So now there comes a reckoning for his blood.” 
GEN.42.23	They did not know that Joseph understood them, for there was an interpreter between them. 
GEN.42.24	Then he turned away from them and wept; and he returned to them and spoke to them. And he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes. 
GEN.42.25	And Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, and to replace every man's money in his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. This was done for them.
GEN.42.26	Then they loaded their asses with their grain, and departed. 
GEN.42.27	And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender at the lodging place, he saw his money in the mouth of his sack; 
GEN.42.28	and he said to his brothers, “My money has been put back; here it is in the mouth of my sack!” At this their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, “What is this that God has done to us?”
GEN.42.29	When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had befallen them, saying, 
GEN.42.30	“The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and took us to be spies of the land. 
GEN.42.31	But we said to him, ‘We are honest men, we are not spies; 
GEN.42.32	we are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.’ 
GEN.42.33	Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I shall know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your households, and go your way. 
GEN.42.34	Bring your youngest brother to me; then I shall know that you are not spies but honest men, and I will deliver to you your brother, and you shall trade in the land.’ ”
GEN.42.35	As they emptied their sacks, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were dismayed. 
GEN.42.36	And Jacob their father said to them, “You have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and now you would take Benjamin; all this has come upon me.” 
GEN.42.37	Then Reuben said to his father, “Slay my two sons if I do not bring him back to you; put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you.” 
GEN.42.38	But he said, “My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he only is left. If harm should befall him on the journey that you are to make, you would bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.”
GEN.43.1	Now the famine was severe in the land. 
GEN.43.2	And when they had eaten the grain which they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go again, buy us a little food.” 
GEN.43.3	But Judah said to him, “The man solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’ 
GEN.43.4	If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food; 
GEN.43.5	but if you will not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’ ” 
GEN.43.6	Israel said, “Why did you treat me so ill as to tell the man that you had another brother?” 
GEN.43.7	They replied, “The man questioned us carefully about ourselves and our kindred, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ What we told him was in answer to these questions; could we in any way know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’?” 
GEN.43.8	And Judah said to Israel his father, “Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and you and also our little ones. 
GEN.43.9	I will be surety for him; of my hand you shall require him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame for ever; 
GEN.43.10	for if we had not delayed, we would now have returned twice.”
GEN.43.11	Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: take some of the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry down to the man a present, a little balm and a little honey, gum, myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds. 
GEN.43.12	Take double the money with you; carry back with you the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks; perhaps it was an oversight. 
GEN.43.13	Take also your brother, and arise, go again to the man; 
GEN.43.14	may God Almighty
GEN.43.15	So the men took the present, and they took double the money with them, and Benjamin; and they arose and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
GEN.43.16	When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal and make ready, for the men are to dine with me at noon.” 
GEN.43.17	The man did as Joseph bade him, and brought the men to Joseph's house. 
GEN.43.18	And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph's house, and they said, “It is because of the money, which was replaced in our sacks the first time, that we are brought in, so that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us, to make slaves of us and seize our asses.” 
GEN.43.19	So they went up to the steward of Joseph's house, and spoke with him at the door of the house, 
GEN.43.20	and said, “Oh, my lord, we came down the first time to buy food; 
GEN.43.21	and when we came to the lodging place we opened our sacks, and there was every man's money in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight; so we have brought it again with us, 
GEN.43.22	and we have brought other money down in our hand to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.” 
GEN.43.23	He replied, “Rest assured, do not be afraid; your God and the God of your father must have put treasure in your sacks for you; I received your money.” Then he brought Simeon out to them. 
GEN.43.24	And when the man had brought the men into Joseph's house, and given them water, and they had washed their feet, and when he had given their asses provender, 
GEN.43.25	they made ready the present for Joseph's coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.
GEN.43.26	When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the present which they had with them, and bowed down to him to the ground. 
GEN.43.27	And he inquired about their welfare, and said, “Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?” 
GEN.43.28	They said, “Your servant our father is well, he is still alive.” And they bowed their heads and made obeisance. 
GEN.43.29	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, “Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me? God be gracious to you, my son!” 
GEN.43.30	Then Joseph made haste, for his heart yearned for his brother, and he sought a place to weep. And he entered his chamber and wept there. 
GEN.43.31	Then he washed his face and came out; and controlling himself he said, “Let food be served.” 
GEN.43.32	They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians. 
GEN.43.33	And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth; and the men looked at one another in amazement. 
GEN.43.34	Portions were taken to them from Joseph's table, but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. So they drank and were merry with him.
GEN.44.1	Then he commanded the steward of his house, “Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man's money in the mouth of his sack, 
GEN.44.2	and put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, with his money for the grain.” And he did as Joseph told him. 
GEN.44.3	As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away with their asses. 
GEN.44.4	When they had gone but a short distance from the city, Joseph said to his steward, “Up, follow after the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you returned evil for good? Why have you stolen my silver cup?
GEN.44.5	Is it not from this that my lord drinks, and by this that he divines? You have done wrong in so doing.’ ”
GEN.44.6	When he overtook them, he spoke to them these words. 
GEN.44.7	They said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing! 
GEN.44.8	Behold, the money which we found in the mouth of our sacks, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan; how then should we steal silver or gold from your lord's house? 
GEN.44.9	With whomever of your servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's slaves.” 
GEN.44.10	He said, “Let it be as you say: he with whom it is found shall be my slave, and the rest of you shall be blameless.” 
GEN.44.11	Then every man quickly lowered his sack to the ground, and every man opened his sack. 
GEN.44.12	And he searched, beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack. 
GEN.44.13	Then they rent their clothes, and every man loaded his ass, and they returned to the city.
GEN.44.14	When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, he was still there; and they fell before him to the ground. 
GEN.44.15	Joseph said to them, “What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that such a man as I can indeed divine?” 
GEN.44.16	And Judah said, “What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how can we clear ourselves? God has found out the guilt of your servants; behold, we are my lord's slaves, both we and he also in whose hand the cup has been found.” 
GEN.44.17	But he said, “Far be it from me that I should do so! Only the man in whose hand the cup was found shall be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.”
GEN.44.18	Then Judah went up to him and said, “O my lord, let your servant, I pray you, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not your anger burn against your servant; for you are like Pharaoh himself. 
GEN.44.19	My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father, or a brother?’ 
GEN.44.20	And we said to my lord, ‘We have a father, an old man, and a young brother, the child of his old age; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother's children; and his father loves him.’ 
GEN.44.21	Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes upon him.’ 
GEN.44.22	We said to my lord, ‘The lad cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.’ 
GEN.44.23	Then you said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall see my face no more.’ 
GEN.44.24	When we went back to your servant my father we told him the words of my lord. 
GEN.44.25	And when our father said, ‘Go again, buy us a little food,’ 
GEN.44.26	we said, ‘We cannot go down. If our youngest brother goes with us, then we will go down; for we cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.’ 
GEN.44.27	Then your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons; 
GEN.44.28	one left me, and I said, Surely he has been torn to pieces; and I have never seen him since. 
GEN.44.29	If you take this one also from me, and harm befalls him, you will bring down my gray hairs in sorrow to Sheol.’ 
GEN.44.30	Now therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the lad is not with us, then, as his life is bound up in the lad's life, 
GEN.44.31	when he sees that the lad is not with us, he will die; and your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol. 
GEN.44.32	For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, then I shall bear the blame in the sight of my father all my life.’ 
GEN.44.33	Now therefore, let your servant, I pray you, remain instead of the lad as a slave to my lord; and let the lad go back with his brothers. 
GEN.44.34	For how can I go back to my father if the lad is not with me? I fear to see the evil that would come upon my father.”
GEN.45.2	And he wept aloud, so that the Egyptians heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard it. 
GEN.45.3	And Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph; is my father still alive?” But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence.
GEN.45.4	So Joseph said to his brothers, “Come near to me, I pray you.” And they came near. And he said, “I am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt. 
GEN.45.5	And now do not be distressed, or angry with yourselves, because you sold me here; for God sent me before you to preserve life. 
GEN.45.6	For the famine has been in the land these two years; and there are yet five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest. 
GEN.45.7	And God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth, and to keep alive for you many survivors. 
GEN.45.8	So it was not you who sent me here, but God; and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.45.9	Make haste and go up to my father and say to him, ‘Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not tarry; 
GEN.45.10	you shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your children and your children's children, and your flocks, your herds, and all that you have; 
GEN.45.11	and there I will provide for you, for there are yet five years of famine to come; lest you and your household, and all that you have, come to poverty.’ 
GEN.45.12	And now your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that it is my mouth that speaks to you. 
GEN.45.13	You must tell my father of all my splendor in Egypt, and of all that you have seen. Make haste and bring my father down here.” 
GEN.45.14	Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck. 
GEN.45.15	And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them; and after that his brothers talked with him.
GEN.45.16	When the report was heard in Pharaoh's house, “Joseph's brothers have come,” it pleased Pharaoh and his servants well. 
GEN.45.17	And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers, ‘Do this: load your beasts and go back to the land of Canaan; 
GEN.45.18	and take your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.’ 
GEN.45.19	Command them
GEN.45.20	Give no thought to your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.’ ”
GEN.45.21	The sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the command of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the journey. 
GEN.45.22	To each and all of them he gave festal garments; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five festal garments. 
GEN.45.23	To his father he sent as follows: ten asses loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses loaded with grain, bread, and provision for his father on the journey. 
GEN.45.24	Then he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he said to them, “Do not quarrel on the way.” 
GEN.45.25	So they went up out of Egypt, and came to the land of Canaan to their father Jacob. 
GEN.45.26	And they told him, “Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt.” And his heart fainted, for he did not believe them. 
GEN.45.27	But when they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them, and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of their father Jacob revived; 
GEN.45.28	and Israel said, “It is enough; Joseph my son is still alive; I will go and see him before I die.”
GEN.46.1	So Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. 
GEN.46.2	And God spoke to Israel in visions of the night, and said, “Jacob, Jacob.” And he said, “Here am I.” 
GEN.46.3	Then he said, “I am God, the God of your father; do not be afraid to go down to Egypt; for I will there make of you a great nation. 
GEN.46.4	I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also bring you up again; and Joseph's hand shall close your eyes.” 
GEN.46.5	Then Jacob set out from Beer-sheba; and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 
GEN.46.6	 They also took their cattle and their goods, which they had gained in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring with him, 
GEN.46.7	his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters; all his offspring he brought with him into Egypt.
GEN.46.9	and the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. 
GEN.46.10	The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanitish woman. 
GEN.46.11	The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
GEN.46.12	The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan); and the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. 
GEN.46.13	The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puvah, Iob, and Shimron. 
GEN.46.14	The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel 
GEN.46.15	(these are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, together with his daughter Dinah; altogether his sons and his daughters numbered thirty-three). 
GEN.46.16	The sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli. 
GEN.46.17	The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, with Serah their sister. And the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel 
GEN.46.18	(these are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter; and these she bore to Jacob—sixteen persons). 
GEN.46.19	The sons of Rachel, Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin. 
GEN.46.20	And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera the priest of On, bore to him. 
GEN.46.21	And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard 
GEN.46.22	(these are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob—fourteen persons in all). 
GEN.46.23	The sons of Dan: Hushim. 
GEN.46.24	The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem 
GEN.46.25	(these are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob—seven persons in all). 
GEN.46.26	All the persons belonging to Jacob who came into Egypt, who were his own offspring, not including Jacob's sons' wives, were sixty-six persons in all; 
GEN.46.27	 and the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two; all the persons of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were seventy.
GEN.46.28	He sent Judah before him to Joseph, to appear
GEN.46.29	Then Joseph made ready his chariot and went up to meet Israel his father in Goshen; and he presented himself to him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. 
GEN.46.30	Israel said to Joseph, “Now let me die, since I have seen your face and know that you are still alive.” 
GEN.46.31	Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's household, “I will go up and tell Pharaoh, and will say to him, ‘My brothers and my father's household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me; 
GEN.46.32	and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.’ 
GEN.46.33	When Pharaoh calls you, and says, ‘What is your occupation?’ 
GEN.46.34	you shall say, ‘Your servants have been keepers of cattle from our youth even until now, both we and our fathers,’ in order that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.”
GEN.47.1	So Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, “My father and my brothers, with their flocks and herds and all that they possess, have come from the land of Canaan; they are now in the land of Goshen.” 
GEN.47.2	And from among his brothers he took five men and presented them to Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.3	Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What is your occupation?” And they said to Pharaoh, “Your servants are shepherds, as our fathers were.” 
GEN.47.4	They said to Pharaoh, “We have come to sojourn in the land; for there is no pasture for your servants' flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan; and now, we pray you, let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.” 
GEN.47.5	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Your father and your brothers have come to you. 
GEN.47.6	The land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land; let them dwell in the land of Goshen; and if you know any able men among them, put them in charge of my cattle.”
GEN.47.7	Then Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.8	And Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How many are the days of the years of your life?” 
GEN.47.9	And Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The days of the years of my sojourning are a hundred and thirty years; few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their sojourning.” 
GEN.47.10	And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.11	Then Joseph settled his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. 
GEN.47.12	And Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all his father's household with food, according to the number of their dependents.
GEN.47.13	Now there was no food in all the land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished by reason of the famine. 
GEN.47.14	And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house. 
GEN.47.15	And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, “Give us food; why should we die before your eyes? For our money is gone.” 
GEN.47.16	And Joseph answered, “Give your cattle, and I will give you food in exchange for your cattle, if your money is gone.” 
GEN.47.17	So they brought their cattle to Joseph; and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses, the flocks, the herds, and the asses: and he supplied them with food in exchange for all their cattle that year. 
GEN.47.18	And when that year was ended, they came to him the following year, and said to him, “We will not hide from my lord that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my lord's; there is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands. 
GEN.47.19	Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for food, and we with our land will be slaves to Pharaoh; and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land may not be desolate.”
GEN.47.20	So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for all the Egyptians sold their fields, because the famine was severe upon them. The land became Pharaoh's; 
GEN.47.21	and as for the people, he made slaves of them
GEN.47.22	Only the land of the priests he did not buy; for the priests had a fixed allowance from Pharaoh, and lived on the allowance which Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their land. 
GEN.47.23	Then Joseph said to the people, “Behold, I have this day bought you and your land for Pharaoh. Now here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land. 
GEN.47.24	And at the harvests you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four fifths shall be your own, as seed for the field and as food for yourselves and your households, and as food for your little ones.” 
GEN.47.25	And they said, “You have saved our lives; may it please my lord, we will be slaves to Pharaoh.” 
GEN.47.26	So Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt, and it stands to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; the land of the priests alone did not become Pharaoh's.
GEN.47.27	Thus Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they gained possessions in it, and were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly. 
GEN.47.28	And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred and forty-seven years.
GEN.47.29	And when the time drew near that Israel must die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, “If now I have found favor in your sight, put your hand under my thigh, and promise to deal loyally and truly with me. Do not bury me in Egypt, 
GEN.47.30	but let me lie with my fathers; carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying place.” He answered, “I will do as you have said.” 
GEN.47.31	And he said, “Swear to me”; and he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself upon the head of his bed.
GEN.48.1	After this Joseph was told, “Behold, your father is ill”; so he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 
GEN.48.2	And it was told to Jacob, “Your son Joseph has come to you”; then Israel summoned his strength, and sat up in bed. 
GEN.48.3	And Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty
GEN.48.4	and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your descendants after you for an everlasting possession.’ 
GEN.48.5	And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are. 
GEN.48.6	And the offspring born to you after them shall be yours; they shall be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance. 
GEN.48.7	For when I came from Paddan, Rachel to my sorrow died in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).”
GEN.48.8	When Israel saw Joseph's sons, he said, “Who are these?” 
GEN.48.9	Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.” And he said, “Bring them to me, I pray you, that I may bless them.” 
GEN.48.10	Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, so that he could not see. So Joseph brought them near him; and he kissed them and embraced them. 
GEN.48.11	And Israel said to Joseph, “I had not thought to see your face; and lo, God has let me see your children also.” 
GEN.48.12	Then Joseph removed them from his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. 
GEN.48.13	And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near him. 
GEN.48.14	And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon the head of Ephraim, who was the younger, and his left hand upon the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands, for Manasseh was the first-born. 
GEN.48.15	And he blessed Joseph, and said,
GEN.48.15	“The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked,
GEN.48.15	the God who has led me all my life long to this day,
GEN.48.16	the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads;
GEN.48.16	and in them let my name be perpetuated, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac;
GEN.48.16	and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.”
GEN.48.17	When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him; and he took his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head. 
GEN.48.18	And Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father; for this one is the first-born; put your right hand upon his head.” 
GEN.48.19	But his father refused, and said, “I know, my son, I know; he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; nevertheless his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a multitude of nations.” 
GEN.48.20	So he blessed them that day, saying,
GEN.48.20	“By you Israel will pronounce blessings, saying,
GEN.48.20	‘God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh’ ”;
GEN.48.20	and thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh. 
GEN.48.21	Then Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am about to die, but God will be with you, and will bring you again to the land of your fathers. 
GEN.48.22	Moreover I have given to you rather than to your brothers one mountain slope
GEN.49.1	Then Jacob called his sons, and said, “Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what shall befall you in days to come.
GEN.49.2	“Assemble and hear, O sons of Jacob,
GEN.49.2	and hearken to Israel your father.
GEN.49.3	Reuben, you are my first-born,
GEN.49.3	my might, and the first fruits of my strength,
GEN.49.3	pre-eminent in pride and pre-eminent in power.
GEN.49.4	Unstable as water, you shall not have pre-eminence
GEN.49.4	because you went up to your father's bed;
GEN.49.4	then you defiled it—you
GEN.49.5	Simeon and Levi are brothers;
GEN.49.5	weapons of violence are their swords.
GEN.49.6	O my soul, come not into their council;
GEN.49.6	O my spirit,
GEN.49.6	for in their anger they slay men,
GEN.49.6	and in their wantonness they hamstring oxen.
GEN.49.7	Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce;
GEN.49.7	and their wrath, for it is cruel!
GEN.49.7	I will divide them in Jacob
GEN.49.7	and scatter them in Israel.
GEN.49.8	Judah, your brothers shall praise you;
GEN.49.8	your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies;
GEN.49.8	your father's sons shall bow down before you.
GEN.49.9	from the prey, my son, you have gone up.
GEN.49.9	He stooped down, he couched as a lion,
GEN.49.9	and as a lioness; who dares rouse him up?
GEN.49.10	The scepter shall not depart from Judah,
GEN.49.10	nor the ruler's staff from between his feet,
GEN.49.10	until he comes to whom it belongs;
GEN.49.10	and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.
GEN.49.11	Binding his foal to the vine
GEN.49.11	and his ass's colt to the choice vine,
GEN.49.11	he washes his garments in wine
GEN.49.11	and his vesture in the blood of grapes;
GEN.49.12	his eyes shall be red with wine,
GEN.49.12	and his teeth white with milk.
GEN.49.13	Zebulun shall dwell at the shore of the sea;
GEN.49.13	he shall become a haven for ships,
GEN.49.13	and his border shall be at Sidon.
GEN.49.14	Issachar is a strong ass,
GEN.49.14	crouching between the sheepfolds;
GEN.49.15	he saw that a resting place was good,
GEN.49.15	and that the land was pleasant;
GEN.49.15	so he bowed his shoulder to bear,
GEN.49.15	and became a slave at forced labor.
GEN.49.16	Dan shall judge his people
GEN.49.16	as one of the tribes of Israel.
GEN.49.17	Dan shall be a serpent in the way,
GEN.49.17	a viper by the path,
GEN.49.17	that bites the horse's heels
GEN.49.17	so that his rider falls backward.
GEN.49.18	I wait for thy salvation, O 
GEN.49.19	Raiders
GEN.49.19	but he shall raid at their heels.
GEN.49.20	Asher's food shall be rich,
GEN.49.20	and he shall yield royal dainties.
GEN.49.21	Naphtali is a hind let loose,
GEN.49.21	that bears comely fawns.
GEN.49.22	Joseph is a fruitful bough,
GEN.49.22	a fruitful bough by a spring;
GEN.49.22	his branches run over the wall.
GEN.49.23	The archers fiercely attacked him,
GEN.49.23	shot at him, and harassed him sorely;
GEN.49.24	yet his bow remained unmoved,
GEN.49.24	his arms
GEN.49.24	by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob
GEN.49.24	(by the name of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel),
GEN.49.25	by the God of your father who will help you,
GEN.49.25	by God Almighty
GEN.49.25	with blessings of heaven above,
GEN.49.25	blessings of the deep that couches beneath,
GEN.49.25	blessings of the breasts and of the womb.
GEN.49.26	The blessings of your father
GEN.49.26	are mighty beyond the blessings of the eternal mountains,
GEN.49.26	the bounties of the everlasting hills;
GEN.49.26	may they be on the head of Joseph,
GEN.49.26	and on the brow of him who was separate from his brothers.
GEN.49.27	Benjamin is a ravenous wolf,
GEN.49.27	in the morning devouring the prey,
GEN.49.27	and at even dividing the spoil.”
GEN.49.28	All these are the twelve tribes of Israel; and this is what their father said to them as he blessed them, blessing each with the blessing suitable to him. 
GEN.49.29	Then he charged them, and said to them, “I am to be gathered to my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 
GEN.49.30	in the cave that is in the field at Mach-pelah, to the east of Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place. 
GEN.49.31	There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah— 
GEN.49.32	the field and the cave that is in it were purchased from the Hittites.” 
GEN.49.33	When Jacob finished charging his sons, he drew up his feet into the bed, and breathed his last, and was gathered to his people.
GEN.50.1	Then Joseph fell on his father's face, and wept over him, and kissed him. 
GEN.50.2	And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel; 
GEN.50.3	forty days were required for it, for so many are required for embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.
GEN.50.4	And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 
GEN.50.5	My father made me swear, saying, ‘I am about to die: in my tomb which I hewed out for myself in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me.’ Now therefore let me go up, I pray you, and bury my father; then I will return.” 
GEN.50.6	And Pharaoh answered, “Go up, and bury your father, as he made you swear.” 
GEN.50.7	So Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, 
GEN.50.8	as well as all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and his father's household; only their children, their flocks, and their herds were left in the land of Goshen. 
GEN.50.9	And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen; it was a very great company. 
GEN.50.10	When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they lamented there with a very great and sorrowful lamentation; and he made a mourning for his father seven days. 
GEN.50.11	When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning on the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians.” Therefore the place was named Abel-mizraim;
GEN.50.12	Thus his sons did for him as he had commanded them; 
GEN.50.13	 for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field at Mach-pelah, to the east of Mamre, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite, to possess as a burying place. 
GEN.50.14	After he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father.
GEN.50.15	When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “It may be that Joseph will hate us and pay us back for all the evil which we did to him.” 
GEN.50.16	So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, “Your father gave this command before he died, 
GEN.50.17	‘Say to Joseph, Forgive, I pray you, the transgression of your brothers and their sin, because they did evil to you.’ And now, we pray you, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.” Joseph wept when they spoke to him. 
GEN.50.18	His brothers also came and fell down before him, and said, “Behold, we are your servants.” 
GEN.50.19	But Joseph said to them, “Fear not, for am I in the place of God? 
GEN.50.20	As for you, you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today. 
GEN.50.21	So do not fear; I will provide for you and your little ones.” Thus he reassured them and comforted them.
GEN.50.22	So Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father's house; and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years. 
GEN.50.23	And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation; the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph's knees. 
GEN.50.24	And Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die; but God will visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.” 
GEN.50.25	Then Joseph took an oath of the sons of Israel, saying, “God will visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.” 
GEN.50.26	So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
EXO.1.2	Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 
EXO.1.3	Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, 
EXO.1.4	Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. 
EXO.1.5	 All the offspring of Jacob were seventy persons; Joseph was already in Egypt. 
EXO.1.6	Then Joseph died, and all his brothers, and all that generation. 
EXO.1.7	But the descendants of Israel were fruitful and increased greatly; they multiplied and grew exceedingly strong; so that the land was filled with them.
EXO.1.8	Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph. 
EXO.1.9	And he said to his people, “Behold, the people of Israel are too many and too mighty for us. 
EXO.1.10	 Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they multiply, and, if war befall us, they join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land.” 
EXO.1.11	Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with heavy burdens; and they built for Pharaoh store-cities, Pithom and Ra-amses. 
EXO.1.12	But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And the Egyptians were in dread of the people of Israel. 
EXO.1.13	So they made the people of Israel serve with rigor, 
EXO.1.14	and made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and brick, and in all kinds of work in the field; in all their work they made them serve with rigor.
EXO.1.15	Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah, 
EXO.1.16	“When you serve as midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the birthstool, if it is a son, you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, she shall live.” 
EXO.1.17	But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but let the male children live. 
EXO.1.18	So the king of Egypt called the midwives, and said to them, “Why have you done this, and let the male children live?” 
EXO.1.19	The midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous and are delivered before the midwife comes to them.” 
EXO.1.20	So God dealt well with the midwives; and the people multiplied and grew very strong. 
EXO.1.21	And because the midwives feared God he gave them families. 
EXO.1.22	Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, “Every son that is born to the Hebrews
EXO.2.1	Now a man from the house of Levi went and took to wife a daughter of Levi. 
EXO.2.2	 The woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. 
EXO.2.3	And when she could hide him no longer she took for him a basket made of bulrushes, and daubed it with bitumen and pitch; and she put the child in it and placed it among the reeds at the river's brink. 
EXO.2.4	And his sister stood at a distance, to know what would be done to him. 
EXO.2.5	 Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, and her maidens walked beside the river; she saw the basket among the reeds and sent her maid to fetch it. 
EXO.2.6	When she opened it she saw the child; and lo, the babe was crying. She took pity on him and said, “This is one of the Hebrews' children.” 
EXO.2.7	Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, “Shall I go and call you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?” 
EXO.2.8	And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, “Go.” So the girl went and called the child's mother. 
EXO.2.9	And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, “Take this child away, and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.” So the woman took the child and nursed him. 
EXO.2.10	And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son; and she named him Moses,
EXO.2.12	 He looked this way and that, and seeing no one he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. 
EXO.2.13	When he went out the next day, behold, two Hebrews were struggling together; and he said to the man that did the wrong, “Why do you strike your fellow?” 
EXO.2.14	 He answered, “Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid, and thought, “Surely the thing is known.” 
EXO.2.15	 When Pharaoh heard of it, he sought to kill Moses.
EXO.2.15	But Moses fled from Pharaoh, and stayed in the land of Midian; and he sat down by a well. 
EXO.2.16	Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. 
EXO.2.17	The shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. 
EXO.2.18	When they came to their father Reuel, he said, “How is it that you have come so soon today?” 
EXO.2.19	They said, “An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and even drew water for us and watered the flock.” 
EXO.2.20	He said to his daughters, “And where is he? Why have you left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.” 
EXO.2.21	And Moses was content to dwell with the man, and he gave Moses his daugher Zipporah. 
EXO.2.22	She bore a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, “I have been a sojourner
EXO.2.23	In the course of those many days the king of Egypt died. And the people of Israel groaned under their bondage, and cried out for help, and their cry under bondage came up to God. 
EXO.2.24	 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. 
EXO.2.25	And God saw the people of Israel, and God knew their condition.
EXO.3.2	 And the angel of the 
EXO.3.3	And Moses said, “I will turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.” 
EXO.3.4	When the 
EXO.3.5	 Then he said, “Do not come near; put off your shoes from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.” 
EXO.3.6	 And he said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.
EXO.3.7	Then the 
EXO.3.8	and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
EXO.3.9	And now, behold, the cry of the people of Israel has come to me, and I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them. 
EXO.3.10	Come, I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring forth my people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt.” 
EXO.3.11	But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt?” 
EXO.3.12	He said, “But I will be with you; and this shall be the sign for you, that I have sent you: when you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God upon this mountain.”
EXO.3.13	Then Moses said to God, “If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what shall I say to them?” 
EXO.3.14	God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.”
EXO.3.15	God also said to Moses, “Say this to the people of Israel, ‘The 
EXO.3.16	Go and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, ‘The 
EXO.3.17	and I promise that I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt, to the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, a land flowing with milk and honey.” ’ 
EXO.3.18	And they will hearken to your voice; and you and the elders of Israel shall go to the king of Egypt and say to him, ‘The 
EXO.3.19	I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless compelled by a mighty hand.
EXO.3.20	So I will stretch out my hand and smite Egypt with all the wonders which I will do in it; after that he will let you go. 
EXO.3.21	And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians; and when you go, you shall not go empty, 
EXO.3.22	but each woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her who sojourns in her house, jewelry of silver and of gold, and clothing, and you shall put them on your sons and on your daughters; thus you shall despoil the Egyptians.”
EXO.4.1	Then Moses answered, “But behold, they will not believe me or listen to my voice, for they will say, ‘The 
EXO.4.2	The 
EXO.4.3	And he said, “Cast it on the ground.” So he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from it. 
EXO.4.4	But the 
EXO.4.5	“that they may believe that the 
EXO.4.6	Again, the 
EXO.4.7	Then God said, “Put your hand back into your bosom.” So he put his hand back into his bosom; and when he took it out, behold, it was restored like the rest of his flesh. 
EXO.4.8	“If they will not believe you,” God said, “or heed the first sign, they may believe the latter sign. 
EXO.4.9	If they will not believe even these two signs or heed your voice, you shall take some water from the Nile and pour it upon the dry ground; and the water which you shall take from the Nile will become blood upon the dry ground.”
EXO.4.10	But Moses said to the 
EXO.4.11	Then the 
EXO.4.12	Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak.” 
EXO.4.13	But he said, “Oh, my Lord, send, I pray, some other person.” 
EXO.4.14	Then the anger of the 
EXO.4.15	And you shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth; and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do. 
EXO.4.16	He shall speak for you to the people; and he shall be a mouth for you, and you shall be to him as God. 
EXO.4.17	And you shall take in your hand this rod, with which you shall do the signs.”
EXO.4.18	Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, “Let me go back, I pray, to my kinsmen in Egypt and see whether they are still alive.” And Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.” 
EXO.4.19	 And the 
EXO.4.20	So Moses took his wife and his sons and set them on an ass, and went back to the land of Egypt; and in his hand Moses took the rod of God.
EXO.4.21	And the 
EXO.4.22	And you shall say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says the 
EXO.4.23	and I say to you, “Let my son go that he may serve me”; if you refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay your first-born son.’ ”
EXO.4.24	At a lodging place on the way the 
EXO.4.25	Then Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son's foreskin, and touched Moses' feet with it, and said, “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me!” 
EXO.4.26	So he let him alone. Then it was that she said, “You are a bridegroom of blood,” because of the circumcision.
EXO.4.27	The 
EXO.4.28	And Moses told Aaron all the words of the 
EXO.4.29	Then Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the people of Israel. 
EXO.4.30	And Aaron spoke all the words which the 
EXO.4.31	And the people believed; and when they heard that the 
EXO.5.1	Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “Thus says the 
EXO.5.2	But Pharaoh said, “Who is the 
EXO.5.3	Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us; let us go, we pray, a three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the 
EXO.5.4	But the king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why do you take the people away from their work? Get to your burdens.” 
EXO.5.5	And Pharaoh said, “Behold, the people of the land are now many and you make them rest from their burdens!” 
EXO.5.6	The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their foremen, 
EXO.5.7	“You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks, as heretofore; let them go and gather straw for themselves. 
EXO.5.8	But the number of bricks which they made heretofore you shall lay upon them, you shall by no means lessen it; for they are idle; therefore they cry, ‘Let us go and offer sacrifice to our God.’ 
EXO.5.9	Let heavier work be laid upon the men that they may labor at it and pay no regard to lying words.”
EXO.5.10	So the taskmasters and the foremen of the people went out and said to the people, “Thus says Pharaoh, ‘I will not give you straw. 
EXO.5.11	Go yourselves, get your straw wherever you can find it; but your work will not be lessened in the least.’ ” 
EXO.5.12	So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt, to gather stubble for straw. 
EXO.5.13	The taskmasters were urgent, saying, “Complete your work, your daily task, as when there was straw.” 
EXO.5.14	And the foremen of the people of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and were asked, “Why have you not done all your task of making bricks today, as hitherto?”
EXO.5.15	Then the foremen of the people of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, “Why do you deal thus with your servants? 
EXO.5.16	No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, ‘Make bricks!’ And behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people.” 
EXO.5.17	But he said, “You are idle, you are idle; therefore you say, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the 
EXO.5.18	Go now, and work; for no straw shall be given you, yet you shall deliver the same number of bricks.” 
EXO.5.19	The foremen of the people of Israel saw that they were in evil plight, when they said, “You shall by no means lessen your daily number of bricks.” 
EXO.5.20	They met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them, as they came forth from Pharaoh; 
EXO.5.21	and they said to them, “The 
EXO.5.22	Then Moses turned again to the 
EXO.5.23	For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he has done evil to this people, and thou hast not delivered thy people at all.”
EXO.6.2	And God said to Moses, “I am the 
EXO.6.3	I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty,
EXO.6.4	I also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they dwelt as sojourners. 
EXO.6.5	Moreover I have heard the groaning of the people of Israel whom the Egyptians hold in bondage and I have remembered my covenant. 
EXO.6.6	Say therefore to the people of Israel, ‘I am the 
EXO.6.7	and I will take you for my people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the 
EXO.6.8	And I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; I will give it to you for a possession. I am the 
EXO.6.9	Moses spoke thus to the people of Israel; but they did not listen to Moses, because of their broken spirit and their cruel bondage.
EXO.6.10	And the 
EXO.6.11	“Go in, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the people of Israel go out of his land.” 
EXO.6.12	But Moses said to the 
EXO.6.13	But the 
EXO.6.15	The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon. 
EXO.6.16	 These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, the years of the life of Levi being a hundred and thirty-seven years. 
EXO.6.17	The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shime-i, by their families. 
EXO.6.18	The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, the years of the life of Kohath being a hundred and thirty-three years. 
EXO.6.19	The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations. 
EXO.6.20	 Amram took to wife Jochebed his father's sister and she bore him Aaron and Moses, the years of the life of Amram being one hundred and thirty-seven years. 
EXO.6.21	The sons of Izhar: Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri. 
EXO.6.22	And the sons of Uzziel: Misha-el, Elzaphan, and Sithri. 
EXO.6.23	Aaron took to wife Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab and the sister of Nahshon; and she bore him Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
EXO.6.24	The sons of Korah: Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites. 
EXO.6.25	Eleazar, Aaron's son, took to wife one of the daughters of Puti-el; and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites by their families.
EXO.6.26	These are the Aaron and Moses to whom the 
EXO.6.27	It was they who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing out the people of Israel from Egypt, this Moses and this Aaron.
EXO.6.28	On the day when the 
EXO.6.29	the 
EXO.6.30	But Moses said to the 
EXO.7.1	And the 
EXO.7.2	You shall speak all that I command you; and Aaron your brother shall tell Pharaoh to let the people of Israel go out of his land. 
EXO.7.3	 But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and though I multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, 
EXO.7.4	Pharaoh will not listen to you; then I will lay my hand upon Egypt and bring forth my hosts, my people the sons of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great acts of judgment. 
EXO.7.5	And the Egyptians shall know that I am the 
EXO.7.6	And Moses and Aaron did so; they did as the 
EXO.7.7	Now Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.
EXO.7.8	And the 
EXO.7.9	“When Pharaoh says to you, ‘Prove yourselves by working a miracle,’ then you shall say to Aaron, ‘Take your rod and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it may become a serpent.’ ” 
EXO.7.10	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did as the 
EXO.7.11	Then Pharaoh summoned the wise men and the sorcerers; and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did the same by their secret arts. 
EXO.7.12	For every man cast down his rod, and they became serpents. But Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods. 
EXO.7.13	Still Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them; as the 
EXO.7.14	Then the 
EXO.7.15	Go to Pharaoh in the morning, as he is going out to the water; wait for him by the river's brink, and take in your hand the rod which was turned into a serpent. 
EXO.7.16	And you shall say to him, ‘The 
EXO.7.17	Thus says the 
EXO.7.18	and the fish in the Nile shall die, and the Nile shall become foul, and the Egyptians will loathe to drink water from the Nile.” ’ ” 
EXO.7.19	And the 
EXO.7.20	Moses and Aaron did as the 
EXO.7.21	And the fish in the Nile died; and the Nile became foul, so that the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. 
EXO.7.22	But the magicians of Egypt did the same by their secret arts; so Pharaoh's heart remained hardened, and he would not listen to them; as the 
EXO.7.23	Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he did not lay even this to heart. 
EXO.7.24	And all the Egyptians dug round about the Nile for water to drink, for they could not drink the water of the Nile.
EXO.7.25	Seven days passed after the 
EXO.8.2	But if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will plague all your country with frogs; 
EXO.8.3	the Nile shall swarm with frogs which shall come up into your house, and into your bedchamber and on your bed, and into the houses of your servants and of your people,
EXO.8.4	the frogs shall come up on you and on your people and on all your servants.” ’ ” 
EXO.8.5	 And the 
EXO.8.6	So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt. 
EXO.8.7	But the magicians did the same by their secret arts, and brought frogs upon the land of Egypt.
EXO.8.8	Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, “Entreat the 
EXO.8.9	Moses said to Pharaoh, “Be pleased to command me when I am to entreat, for you and for your servants and for your people, that the frogs be destroyed from you and your houses and be left only in the Nile.” 
EXO.8.10	And he said, “Tomorrow.” Moses said, “Be it as you say, that you may know that there is no one like the 
EXO.8.11	The frogs shall depart from you and your houses and your servants and your people; they shall be left only in the Nile.” 
EXO.8.12	So Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried to the 
EXO.8.13	And the 
EXO.8.14	And they gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank. 
EXO.8.15	But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart, and would not listen to them; as the 
EXO.8.16	Then the 
EXO.8.17	And they did so; Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and struck the dust of the earth, and there came gnats on man and beast; all the dust of the earth became gnats throughout all the land of Egypt. 
EXO.8.18	The magicians tried by their secret arts to bring forth gnats, but they could not. So there were gnats on man and beast. 
EXO.8.19	And the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” But Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them; as the 
EXO.8.20	Then the 
EXO.8.21	Else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you and your servants and your people, and into your houses; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with swarms of flies, and also the ground on which they stand. 
EXO.8.22	But on that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, where my people dwell, so that no swarms of flies shall be there; that you may know that I am the 
EXO.8.23	Thus I will put a division
EXO.8.24	And the 
EXO.8.25	Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God within the land.” 
EXO.8.26	But Moses said, “It would not be right to do so; for we shall sacrifice to the 
EXO.8.27	We must go three days' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the 
EXO.8.28	So Pharaoh said, “I will let you go, to sacrifice to the 
EXO.8.29	Then Moses said, “Behold, I am going out from you and I will pray to the 
EXO.8.30	So Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to the 
EXO.8.31	And the 
EXO.8.32	But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and did not let the people go.
EXO.9.1	Then the 
EXO.9.2	For if you refuse to let them go and still hold them, 
EXO.9.3	behold, the hand of the 
EXO.9.4	But the 
EXO.9.5	And the 
EXO.9.6	And on the morrow the 
EXO.9.7	And Pharaoh sent, and behold, not one of the cattle of the Israelites was dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
EXO.9.8	And the 
EXO.9.9	And it shall become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and become boils breaking out in sores on man and beast throughout all the land of Egypt.” 
EXO.9.10	So they took ashes from the kiln, and stood before Pharaoh, and Moses threw them toward heaven, and it became boils breaking out in sores on man and beast. 
EXO.9.11	And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were upon the magicians and upon all the Egyptians. 
EXO.9.12	But the 
EXO.9.13	Then the 
EXO.9.14	For this time I will send all my plagues upon your heart, and upon your servants and your people, that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth. 
EXO.9.15	For by now I could have put forth my hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth; 
EXO.9.16	 but for this purpose have I let you live, to show you my power, so that my name may be declared throughout all the earth. 
EXO.9.17	You are still exalting yourself against my people, and will not let them go. 
EXO.9.18	Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause very heavy hail to fall, such as never has been in Egypt from the day it was founded until now. 
EXO.9.19	Now therefore send, get your cattle and all that you have in the field into safe shelter; for the hail shall come down upon every man and beast that is in the field and is not brought home, and they shall die.” ’ ” 
EXO.9.20	Then he who feared the word of the 
EXO.9.21	but he who did not regard the word of the 
EXO.9.22	And the 
EXO.9.23	Then Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven; and the 
EXO.9.24	there was hail, and fire flashing continually in the midst of the hail, very heavy hail, such as had never been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. 
EXO.9.25	The hail struck down everything that was in the field throughout all the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and the hail struck down every plant of the field, and shattered every tree of the field. 
EXO.9.26	Only in the land of Goshen, where the people of Israel were, there was no hail.
EXO.9.27	Then Pharaoh sent, and called Moses and Aaron, and said to them, “I have sinned this time; the 
EXO.9.28	Entreat the 
EXO.9.29	Moses said to him, “As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will stretch out my hands to the 
EXO.9.30	But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the 
EXO.9.31	(The flax and the barley were ruined, for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud. 
EXO.9.32	But the wheat and the spelt were not ruined, for they are late in coming up.) 
EXO.9.33	So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and stretched out his hands to the 
EXO.9.34	But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned yet again, and hardened his heart, he and his servants. 
EXO.9.35	So the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people of Israel go; as the 
EXO.10.1	Then the 
EXO.10.2	and that you may tell in the hearing of your son and of your son's son how I have made sport of the Egyptians and what signs I have done among them; that you may know that I am the 
EXO.10.3	So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and said to him, “Thus says the 
EXO.10.4	For if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country, 
EXO.10.5	and they shall cover the face of the land, so that no one can see the land; and they shall eat what is left to you after the hail, and they shall eat every tree of yours which grows in the field, 
EXO.10.6	and they shall fill your houses, and the houses of all your servants and of all the Egyptians; as neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen, from the day they came on earth to this day.’ ” Then he turned and went out from Pharaoh.
EXO.10.7	And Pharaoh's servants said to him, “How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the 
EXO.10.8	So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh; and he said to them, “Go, serve the 
EXO.10.9	And Moses said, “We will go with our young and our old; we will go with our sons and daughters and with our flocks and herds, for we must hold a feast to the 
EXO.10.10	And he said to them, “The 
EXO.10.11	No! Go, the men among you, and serve the 
EXO.10.12	Then the 
EXO.10.13	So Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the 
EXO.10.14	And the locusts came up over all the land of Egypt, and settled on the whole country of Egypt, such a dense swarm of locusts as had never been before, nor ever shall be again. 
EXO.10.15	For they covered the face of the whole land, so that the land was darkened, and they ate all the plants in the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left; not a green thing remained, neither tree nor plant of the field, through all the land of Egypt. 
EXO.10.16	Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron in haste, and said, “I have sinned against the 
EXO.10.17	Now therefore, forgive my sin, I pray you, only this once, and entreat the 
EXO.10.18	So he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the 
EXO.10.19	And the 
EXO.10.20	But the 
EXO.10.21	Then the 
EXO.10.22	So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days; 
EXO.10.23	they did not see one another, nor did any rise from his place for three days; but all the people of Israel had light where they dwelt. 
EXO.10.24	Then Pharaoh called Moses, and said, “Go, serve the 
EXO.10.25	But Moses said, “You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to the 
EXO.10.26	Our cattle also must go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind, for we must take of them to serve the 
EXO.10.27	But the 
EXO.10.28	Then Pharaoh said to him, “Get away from me; take heed to yourself; never see my face again; for in the day you see my face you shall die.” 
EXO.10.29	Moses said, “As you say! I will not see your face again.”
EXO.11.1	The 
EXO.11.2	Speak now in the hearing of the people, that they ask, every man of his neighbor and every woman of her neighbor, jewelry of silver and of gold.” 
EXO.11.3	And the 
EXO.11.4	And Moses said, “Thus says the 
EXO.11.5	and all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh who sits upon his throne, even to the first-born of the maidservant who is behind the mill; and all the first-born of the cattle. 
EXO.11.6	And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has never been, nor ever shall be again. 
EXO.11.7	But against any of the people of Israel, either man or beast, not a dog shall growl; that you may know that the 
EXO.11.8	And all these your servants shall come down to me, and bow down to me, saying, ‘Get you out, and all the people who follow you.’ And after that I will go out.” And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger. 
EXO.11.9	Then the 
EXO.11.10	Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh; and the 
EXO.12.1	The 
EXO.12.2	“This month shall be for you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year for you. 
EXO.12.3	Tell all the congregation of Israel that on the tenth day of this month they shall take every man a lamb according to their fathers' houses, a lamb for a household; 
EXO.12.4	and if the household is too small for a lamb, then a man and his neighbor next to his house shall take according to the number of persons; according to what each can eat you shall make your count for the lamb. 
EXO.12.5	Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old; you shall take it from the sheep or from the goats; 
EXO.12.6	and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month, when the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill their lambs in the evening.
EXO.12.7	Then they shall take some of the blood, and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat them. 
EXO.12.8	They shall eat the flesh that night, roasted; with unleavened bread and bitter herbs they shall eat it. 
EXO.12.9	Do not eat any of it raw or boiled with water, but roasted, its head with its legs and its inner parts. 
EXO.12.10	And you shall let none of it remain until the morning, anything that remains until the morning you shall burn. 
EXO.12.11	In this manner you shall eat it: your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste. It is the 
EXO.12.12	For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will smite all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the 
EXO.12.13	 The blood shall be a sign for you, upon the houses where you are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague shall fall upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.
EXO.12.14	“This day shall be for you a memorial day, and you shall keep it as a feast to the 
EXO.12.15	Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread; on the first day you shall put away leaven out of your houses, for if any one eats what is leavened, from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel. 
EXO.12.16	On the first day you shall hold a holy assembly, and on the seventh day a holy assembly; no work shall be done on those days; but what every one must eat, that only may be prepared by you. 
EXO.12.17	And you shall observe the feast of unleavened bread, for on this very day I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt: therefore you shall observe this day, throughout your generations, as an ordinance for ever. 
EXO.12.18	In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, and so until the twenty-first day of the month at evening. 
EXO.12.19	For seven days no leaven shall be found in your houses; for if any one eats what is leavened, that person shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is a sojourner or a native of the land. 
EXO.12.20	You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your dwellings you shall eat unleavened bread.”
EXO.12.21	Then Moses called all the elders of Israel, and said to them, “Select lambs for yourselves according to your families, and kill the passover lamb. 
EXO.12.22	Take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood which is in the basin, and touch the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood which is in the basin; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning. 
EXO.12.23	For the 
EXO.12.24	You shall observe this rite as an ordinance for you and for your sons for ever. 
EXO.12.25	And when you come to the land which the 
EXO.12.26	And when your children say to you, ‘What do you mean by this service?’ 
EXO.12.27	you shall say, ‘It is the sacrifice of the 
EXO.12.28	Then the people of Israel went and did so; as the 
EXO.12.29	At midnight the 
EXO.12.30	And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where one was not dead. 
EXO.12.31	And he summoned Moses and Aaron by night, and said, “Rise up, go forth from among my people, both you and the people of Israel; and go, serve the 
EXO.12.32	Take your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also!”
EXO.12.33	And the Egyptians were urgent with the people, to send them out of the land in haste; for they said, “We are all dead men.” 
EXO.12.34	So the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading bowls being bound up in their mantles on their shoulders. 
EXO.12.35	The people of Israel had also done as Moses told them, for they had asked of the Egyptians jewelry of silver and gold, and clothing; 
EXO.12.36	and the 
EXO.12.37	And the people of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children. 
EXO.12.38	A mixed multitude also went up with them, and very many cattle, both flocks and herds. 
EXO.12.39	And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they had brought out of Egypt, for it was not leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any provisions.
EXO.12.41	And at the end of four hundred and thirty years, on that very day, all the hosts of the 
EXO.12.42	It was a night of watching by the 
EXO.12.43	And the 
EXO.12.44	but every slave that is bought for money may eat of it after you have circumcised him. 
EXO.12.45	No sojourner or hired servant may eat of it. 
EXO.12.46	 In one house shall it be eaten; you shall not carry forth any of the flesh outside the house; and you shall not break a bone of it. 
EXO.12.47	All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. 
EXO.12.48	And when a stranger shall sojourn with you and would keep the passover to the 
EXO.12.49	 There shall be one law for the native and for the stranger who sojourns among you.”
EXO.12.50	Thus did all the people of Israel; as the 
EXO.12.51	And on that very day the 
EXO.13.1	The 
EXO.13.2	 “Consecrate to me all the first-born; whatever is the first to open the womb among the people of Israel, both of man and of beast, is mine.”
EXO.13.3	And Moses said to the people, “Remember this day, in which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage, for by strength of hand the 
EXO.13.4	This day you are to go forth, in the month of Abib. 
EXO.13.5	And when the 
EXO.13.6	Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the 
EXO.13.7	Unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days; no leavened bread shall be seen with you, and no leaven shall be seen with you in all your territory. 
EXO.13.8	And you shall tell your son on that day, ‘It is because of what the 
EXO.13.9	And it shall be to you as a sign on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes, that the law of the 
EXO.13.10	You shall therefore keep this ordinance at its appointed time from year to year.
EXO.13.11	“And when the 
EXO.13.12	you shall set apart to the 
EXO.13.13	Every firstling of an ass you shall redeem with a lamb, or if you will not redeem it you shall break its neck. Every first-born of man among your sons you shall redeem. 
EXO.13.14	And when in time to come your son asks you, ‘What does this mean?’ you shall say to him, ‘By strength of hand the 
EXO.13.15	For when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the 
EXO.13.16	It shall be as a mark on your hand or frontlets between your eyes; for by a strong hand the 
EXO.13.17	When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, “Lest the people repent when they see war, and return to Egypt.” 
EXO.13.18	But God led the people round by the way of the wilderness toward the Red Sea. And the people of Israel went up out of the land of Egypt equipped for battle. 
EXO.13.19	 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him; for Joseph had solemnly sworn the people of Israel, saying, “God will visit you; then you must carry my bones with you from here.” 
EXO.13.20	And they moved on from Succoth, and encamped at Etham, on the edge of the wilderness. 
EXO.13.21	And the 
EXO.13.22	the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night did not depart from before the people.
EXO.14.1	Then the 
EXO.14.2	“Tell the people of Israel to turn back and encamp in front of Pi-ha-hiroth, between Migdol and the sea, in front of Baal-zephon; you shall encamp over against it, by the sea. 
EXO.14.3	For Pharaoh will say of the people of Israel, ‘They are entangled in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.’ 
EXO.14.4	And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue them and I will get glory over Pharaoh and all his host; and the Egyptians shall know that I am the 
EXO.14.5	When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, the mind of Pharaoh and his servants was changed toward the people, and they said, “What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?” 
EXO.14.6	So he made ready his chariot and took his army with him, 
EXO.14.7	and took six hundred picked chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt with officers over all of them. 
EXO.14.8	 And the 
EXO.14.9	The Egyptians pursued them, all Pharaoh's horses and chariots and his horsemen and his army, and overtook them encamped at the sea, by Pi-ha-hiroth, in front of Baal-zephon.
EXO.14.10	When Pharaoh drew near, the people of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were in great fear. And the people of Israel cried out to the 
EXO.14.11	and they said to Moses, “Is it because there are no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What have you done to us, in bringing us out of Egypt? 
EXO.14.12	 Is not this what we said to you in Egypt, ‘Let us alone and let us serve the Egyptians’? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.” 
EXO.14.13	And Moses said to the people, “Fear not, stand firm, and see the salvation of the 
EXO.14.14	The 
EXO.14.15	The 
EXO.14.16	Lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, that the people of Israel may go on dry ground through the sea. 
EXO.14.17	And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they shall go in after them, and I will get glory over Pharaoh and all his host, his chariots, and his horsemen. 
EXO.14.18	And the Egyptians shall know that I am the 
EXO.14.19	Then the angel of God who went before the host of Israel moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them, 
EXO.14.20	coming between the host of Egypt and the host of Israel. And there was the cloud and the darkness; and the night passed
EXO.14.21	Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the 
EXO.14.22	And the people of Israel went into the midst of the sea on dry ground, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. 
EXO.14.23	The Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. 
EXO.14.24	And in the morning watch the 
EXO.14.25	clogging
EXO.14.26	Then the 
EXO.14.27	So Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its wonted flow when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled into it, and the 
EXO.14.28	The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen and all the host
EXO.14.29	But the people of Israel walked on dry ground through the sea, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
EXO.14.30	Thus the 
EXO.14.31	And Israel saw the great work which the 
EXO.15.1	Then Moses and the people of Israel sang this song to the 
EXO.15.1	“I will sing to the 
EXO.15.1	the horse and his rider
EXO.15.2	The 
EXO.15.2	and he has become my salvation;
EXO.15.2	this is my God, and I will praise him,
EXO.15.2	my father's God, and I will exalt him.
EXO.15.3	The 
EXO.15.3	the 
EXO.15.4	“Pharaoh's chariots and his host he cast into the sea;
EXO.15.4	and his picked officers are sunk in the Red Sea.
EXO.15.5	The floods cover them;
EXO.15.5	they went down into the depths like a stone.
EXO.15.6	Thy right hand, O 
EXO.15.6	thy right hand, O 
EXO.15.7	In the greatness of thy majesty thou overthrowest thy adversaries;
EXO.15.7	thou sendest forth thy fury, it consumes them like stubble.
EXO.15.8	At the blast of thy nostrils the waters piled up,
EXO.15.8	the floods stood up in a heap;
EXO.15.8	the deeps congealed in the heart of the sea.
EXO.15.9	The enemy said, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake,
EXO.15.9	I will divide the spoil, my desire shall have its fill of them.
EXO.15.9	I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.’
EXO.15.10	Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them;
EXO.15.10	they sank as lead in the mighty waters.
EXO.15.11	“Who is like thee, O 
EXO.15.11	Who is like thee, majestic in holiness,
EXO.15.11	terrible in glorious deeds, doing wonders?
EXO.15.12	Thou didst stretch out thy right hand,
EXO.15.12	the earth swallowed them.
EXO.15.13	“Thou hast led in thy steadfast love the people whom thou hast redeemed,
EXO.15.13	thou hast guided them by thy strength to thy holy abode.
EXO.15.14	The peoples have heard, they tremble;
EXO.15.14	pangs have seized on the inhabitants of Philistia.
EXO.15.15	Now are the chiefs of Edom dismayed;
EXO.15.15	the leaders of Moab, trembling seizes them;
EXO.15.15	all the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away.
EXO.15.16	Terror and dread fall upon them;
EXO.15.16	because of the greatness of thy arm, they are as still as a stone,
EXO.15.16	till thy people, O 
EXO.15.16	till the people pass by whom thou hast purchased.
EXO.15.17	Thou wilt bring them in, and plant them on thy own mountain,
EXO.15.17	the place, O 
EXO.15.17	the sanctuary, O 
EXO.15.18	The 
EXO.15.19	For when the horses of Pharaoh with his chariots and his horsemen went into the sea, the 
EXO.15.20	Then Miriam, the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and dancing. 
EXO.15.21	And Miriam sang to them:
EXO.15.21	“Sing to the 
EXO.15.21	the horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea.”
EXO.15.22	Then Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went into the wilderness of Shur; they went three days in the wilderness and found no water. 
EXO.15.23	When they came to Marah, they could not drink the water of Marah because it was bitter; therefore it was named Marah.
EXO.15.24	And the people murmured against Moses, saying, “What shall we drink?” 
EXO.15.25	And he cried to the 
EXO.15.25	There the 
EXO.15.26	saying, “If you will diligently hearken to the voice of the 
EXO.15.27	Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees; and they encamped there by the water.
EXO.16.1	They set out from Elim, and all the congregation of the people of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had departed from the land of Egypt. 
EXO.16.2	And the whole congregation of the people of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness, 
EXO.16.3	 and said to them, “Would that we had died by the hand of the 
EXO.16.5	On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather daily.” 
EXO.16.6	So Moses and Aaron said to all the people of Israel, “At evening you shall know that it was the 
EXO.16.7	and in the morning you shall see the glory of the 
EXO.16.8	And Moses said, “When the 
EXO.16.9	And Moses said to Aaron, “Say to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, ‘Come near before the 
EXO.16.10	And as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the 
EXO.16.11	And the 
EXO.16.12	“I have heard the murmurings of the people of Israel; say to them, ‘At twilight you shall eat flesh, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread; then you shall know that I am the 
EXO.16.13	In the evening quails came up and covered the camp; and in the morning dew lay round about the camp. 
EXO.16.14	And when the dew had gone up, there was on the face of the wilderness a fine, flake-like thing, fine as hoarfrost on the ground. 
EXO.16.15	When the people of Israel saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?”
EXO.16.16	This is what the 
EXO.16.17	And the people of Israel did so; they gathered, some more, some less. 
EXO.16.18	 But when they measured it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; each gathered according to what he could eat. 
EXO.16.19	And Moses said to them, “Let no man leave any of it till the morning.” 
EXO.16.20	But they did not listen to Moses; some left part of it till the morning, and it bred worms and became foul; and Moses was angry with them. 
EXO.16.21	Morning by morning they gathered it, each as much as he could eat; but when the sun grew hot, it melted.
EXO.16.22	On the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers apiece; and when all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses, 
EXO.16.23	he said to them, “This is what the 
EXO.16.24	So they laid it by till the morning, as Moses bade them; and it did not become foul, and there were no worms in it. 
EXO.16.25	Moses said, “Eat it today, for today is a sabbath to the 
EXO.16.26	Six days you shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is a sabbath, there will be none.” 
EXO.16.27	On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, and they found none. 
EXO.16.28	And the 
EXO.16.29	See! The 
EXO.16.30	So the people rested on the seventh day.
EXO.16.31	Now the house of Israel called its name manna; it was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. 
EXO.16.32	And Moses said, “This is what the 
EXO.16.33	And Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar, and put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the 
EXO.16.34	As the 
EXO.16.35	And the people of Israel ate the manna forty years, till they came to a habitable land; they ate the manna, till they came to the border of the land of Canaan. 
EXO.16.36	(An omer is the tenth part of an ephah.)
EXO.17.1	All the congregation of the people of Israel moved on from the wilderness of Sin by stages, according to the commandment of the 
EXO.17.2	Therefore the people found fault with Moses, and said, “Give us water to drink.” And Moses said to them, “Why do you find fault with me? Why do you put the 
EXO.17.3	 But the people thirsted there for water, and the people murmured against Moses, and said, “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?” 
EXO.17.4	So Moses cried to the 
EXO.17.5	And the 
EXO.17.6	Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water shall come out of it, that the people may drink.” And Moses did so, in the sight of the elders of Israel. 
EXO.17.7	And he called the name of the place Massah
EXO.17.8	Then came Amalek and fought with Israel at Rephidim. 
EXO.17.9	And Moses said to Joshua, “Choose for us men, and go out, fight with Amalek; tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.” 
EXO.17.10	So Joshua did as Moses told him, and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 
EXO.17.11	Whenever Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed; and whenever he lowered his hand, Amalek prevailed. 
EXO.17.12	But Moses' hands grew weary; so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat upon it, and Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side; so his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. 
EXO.17.13	And Joshua mowed down Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
EXO.17.15	And Moses built an altar and called the name of it, The 
EXO.17.16	saying, “A hand upon the banner of the 
EXO.18.1	Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel his people, how the 
EXO.18.2	Now Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, had taken Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her away, 
EXO.18.3	 and her two sons, of whom the name of the one was Gershom (for he said, “I have been a sojourner
EXO.18.4	and the name of the other, Eliezer
EXO.18.5	And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness where he was encamped at the mountain of God. 
EXO.18.6	And when one told Moses, “Lo,
EXO.18.7	Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare, and went into the tent. 
EXO.18.8	Then Moses told his father-in-law all that the 
EXO.18.9	And Jethro rejoiced for all the good which the 
EXO.18.10	And Jethro said, “Blessed be the 
EXO.18.11	Now I know that the 
EXO.18.12	And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, offered
EXO.18.13	On the morrow Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood about Moses from morning till evening. 
EXO.18.14	When Moses' father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, “What is this that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand about you from morning till evening?” 
EXO.18.15	And Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire of God; 
EXO.18.16	when they have a dispute, they come to me and I decide between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God and his decisions.” 
EXO.18.17	Moses' father-in-law said to him, “What you are doing is not good. 
EXO.18.18	You and the people with you will wear yourselves out, for the thing is too heavy for you; you are not able to perform it alone. 
EXO.18.19	Listen now to my voice; I will give you counsel, and God be with you! You shall represent the people before God, and bring their cases to God; 
EXO.18.20	and you shall teach them the statutes and the decisions, and make them know the way in which they must walk and what they must do. 
EXO.18.21	Moreover choose able men from all the people, such as fear God, men who are trustworthy and who hate a bribe; and place such men over the people as rulers of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens. 
EXO.18.22	And let them judge the people at all times; every great matter they shall bring to you, but any small matter they shall decide themselves; so it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you. 
EXO.18.23	If you do this, and God so commands you, then you will be able to endure, and all this people also will go to their place in peace.”
EXO.18.24	So Moses gave heed to the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said. 
EXO.18.25	Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens. 
EXO.18.26	And they judged the people at all times; hard cases they brought to Moses, but any small matter they decided themselves. 
EXO.18.27	Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way to his own country.
EXO.19.1	On the third new moon after the people of Israel had gone forth out of the land of Egypt, on that day they came into the wilderness of Sinai. 
EXO.19.2	And when they set out from Rephidim and came into the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mountain. 
EXO.19.3	And Moses went up to God, and the 
EXO.19.4	You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself. 
EXO.19.5	 Now therefore, if you will obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my own possession among all peoples; for all the earth is mine, 
EXO.19.6	and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.”
EXO.19.7	So Moses came and called the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which the 
EXO.19.8	And all the people answered together and said, “All that the 
EXO.19.9	And the 
EXO.19.9	Then Moses told the words of the people to the 
EXO.19.10	And the 
EXO.19.11	and be ready by the third day; for on the third day the 
EXO.19.12	 And you shall set bounds for the people round about, saying, ‘Take heed that you do not go up into the mountain or touch the border of it; whoever touches the mountain shall be put to death; 
EXO.19.13	no hand shall touch him, but he shall be stoned or shot; whether beast or man, he shall not live.’ When the trumpet sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain.” 
EXO.19.14	So Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and consecrated the people; and they washed their garments. 
EXO.19.15	And he said to the people, “Be ready by the third day; do not go near a woman.”
EXO.19.16	On the morning of the third day there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast, so that all the people who were in the camp trembled. 
EXO.19.17	Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God; and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain. 
EXO.19.18	And Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke, because the 
EXO.19.19	And as the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him in thunder. 
EXO.19.20	And the 
EXO.19.21	And the 
EXO.19.22	And also let the priests who come near to the 
EXO.19.23	And Moses said to the 
EXO.19.24	And the 
EXO.19.25	So Moses went down to the people and told them.
EXO.20.1	And God spoke all these words, saying,
EXO.20.5	 you shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I the 
EXO.20.6	but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.
EXO.20.9	Six days you shall labor, and do all your work; 
EXO.20.10	but the seventh day is a sabbath to the 
EXO.20.11	for in six days the 
EXO.20.18	Now when all the people perceived the thunderings and the lightnings and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking, the people were afraid and trembled; and they stood afar off, 
EXO.20.19	and said to Moses, “You speak to us, and we will hear; but let not God speak to us, lest we die.” 
EXO.20.20	And Moses said to the people, “Do not fear; for God has come to prove you, and that the fear of him may be before your eyes, that you may not sin.”
EXO.20.21	And the people stood afar off, while Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was. 
EXO.20.22	And the 
EXO.20.23	 You shall not make gods of silver to be with me, nor shall you make for yourselves gods of gold. 
EXO.20.24	 An altar of earth you shall make for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen; in every place where I cause my name to be remembered I will come to you and bless you. 
EXO.20.25	 And if you make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stones; for if you wield your tool upon it you profane it. 
EXO.20.26	And you shall not go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness be not exposed on it.’
EXO.21.1	“Now these are the ordinances which you shall set before them. 
EXO.21.2	 When you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve six years, and in the seventh he shall go out free, for nothing. 
EXO.21.3	If he comes in single, he shall go out single; if he comes in married, then his wife shall go out with him. 
EXO.21.4	If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master's and he shall go out alone. 
EXO.21.5	But if the slave plainly says, ‘I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,’ 
EXO.21.6	then his master shall bring him to God, and he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for life.
EXO.21.7	“When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she shall not go out as the male slaves do. 
EXO.21.8	If she does not please her master, who has designated her
EXO.21.9	If he designates her for his son, he shall deal with her as with a daughter. 
EXO.21.10	If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, or her marital rights. 
EXO.21.11	And if he does not do these three things for her, she shall go out for nothing, without payment of money.
EXO.21.13	 But if he did not lie in wait for him, but God let him fall into his hand, then I will appoint for you a place to which he may flee. 
EXO.21.14	But if a man willfully attacks another to kill him treacherously, you shall take him from my altar, that he may die.
EXO.21.15	“Whoever strikes his father or his mother shall be put to death.
EXO.21.18	“When men quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone or with his fist and the man does not die but keeps his bed, 
EXO.21.19	then if the man rises again and walks abroad with his staff, he that struck him shall be clear; only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall have him thoroughly healed.
EXO.21.20	“When a man strikes his slave, male or female, with a rod and the slave dies under his hand, he shall be punished. 
EXO.21.21	But if the slave survives a day or two, he is not to be punished; for the slave is his money.
EXO.21.22	“When men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that there is a miscarriage, and yet no harm follows, the one who hurt her shall
EXO.21.23	 If any harm follows, then you shall give life for life, 
EXO.21.24	eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 
EXO.21.25	burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
EXO.21.26	“When a man strikes the eye of his slave, male or female, and destroys it, he shall let the slave go free for the eye's sake. 
EXO.21.27	If he knocks out the tooth of his slave, male or female, he shall let the slave go free for the tooth's sake.
EXO.21.28	“When an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be clear. 
EXO.21.29	But if the ox has been accustomed to gore in the past, and its owner has been warned but has not kept it in, and it kills a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death. 
EXO.21.30	If a ransom is laid on him, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is laid upon him. 
EXO.21.31	If it gores a man's son or daughter, he shall be dealt with according to this same rule. 
EXO.21.32	If the ox gores a slave, male or female, the owner shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.
EXO.21.33	“When a man leaves a pit open, or when a man digs a pit and does not cover it, and an ox or an ass falls into it, 
EXO.21.34	the owner of the pit shall make it good; he shall give money to its owner, and the dead beast shall be his.
EXO.21.35	“When one man's ox hurts another's, so that it dies, then they shall sell the live ox and divide the price of it; and the dead beast also they shall divide. 
EXO.21.36	Or if it is known that the ox has been accustomed to gore in the past, and its owner has not kept it in, he shall pay ox for ox, and the dead beast shall be his.
EXO.22.2	 If the stolen beast is found alive in his possession, whether it is an ox or an ass or a sheep, he shall pay double.
EXO.22.4	 but if the sun has risen upon him, there shall be bloodguilt for him.
EXO.22.5	“When a man causes a field or vineyard to be grazed over, or lets his beast loose and it feeds in another man's field, he shall make restitution from the best in his own field and in his own vineyard.
EXO.22.6	“When fire breaks out and catches in thorns so that the stacked grain or the standing grain or the field is consumed, he that kindled the fire shall make full restitution.
EXO.22.8	If the thief is not found, the owner of the house shall come near to God, to show whether or not he has put his hand to his neighbor's goods.
EXO.22.9	“For every breach of trust, whether it is for ox, for ass, for sheep, for clothing, or for any kind of lost thing, of which one says, ‘This is it,’ the case of both parties shall come before God; he whom God shall condemn shall pay double to his neighbor.
EXO.22.10	“If a man delivers to his neighbor an ass or an ox or a sheep or any beast to keep, and it dies or is hurt or is driven away, without any one seeing it, 
EXO.22.11	an oath by the 
EXO.22.12	But if it is stolen from him, he shall make restitution to its owner. 
EXO.22.13	If it is torn by beasts, let him bring it as evidence; he shall not make restitution for what has been torn.
EXO.22.14	“If a man borrows anything of his neighbor, and it is hurt or dies, the owner not being with it, he shall make full restitution. 
EXO.22.15	If the owner was with it, he shall not make restitution; if it was hired, it came for its hire.
EXO.22.17	If her father utterly refuses to give her to him, he shall pay money equivalent to the marriage present for virgins.
EXO.22.20	“Whoever sacrifices to any god, save to the 
EXO.22.22	 You shall not afflict any widow or orphan. 
EXO.22.23	If you do afflict them, and they cry out to me, I will surely hear their cry; 
EXO.22.24	and my wrath will burn, and I will kill you with the sword, and your wives shall become widows and your children fatherless.
EXO.22.26	If ever you take your neighbor's garment in pledge, you shall restore it to him before the sun goes down; 
EXO.22.27	for that is his only covering, it is his mantle for his body; in what else shall he sleep? And if he cries to me, I will hear, for I am compassionate.
EXO.22.29	“The first-born of your sons you shall give to me. 
EXO.22.30	You shall do likewise with your oxen and with your sheep: seven days it shall be with its dam; on the eighth day you shall give it to me.
EXO.23.2	You shall not follow a multitude to do evil; nor shall you bear witness in a suit, turning aside after a multitude, so as to pervert justice; 
EXO.23.3	 nor shall you be partial to a poor man in his suit.
EXO.23.4	“If you meet your enemy's ox or his ass going astray, you shall bring it back to him. 
EXO.23.5	If you see the ass of one who hates you lying under its burden, you shall refrain from leaving him with it, you shall help him to lift it up.
EXO.23.6	“You shall not pervert the justice due to your poor in his suit. 
EXO.23.7	 Keep far from a false charge, and do not slay the innocent and righteous, for I will not acquit the wicked. 
EXO.23.8	 And you shall take no bribe, for a bribe blinds the officials, and subverts the cause of those who are in the right.
EXO.23.11	but the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow, that the poor of your people may eat; and what they leave the wild beasts may eat. You shall do likewise with your vineyard, and with your olive orchard.
EXO.23.13	Take heed to all that I have said to you; and make no mention of the names of other gods, nor let such be heard out of your mouth.
EXO.23.15	You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread; as I commanded you, you shall eat unleavened bread for seven days at the appointed time in the month of Abib, for in it you came out of Egypt. None shall appear before me empty-handed. 
EXO.23.16	You shall keep the feast of harvest, of the first fruits of your labor, of what you sow in the field. You shall keep the feast of ingathering at the end of the year, when you gather in from the field the fruit of your labor. 
EXO.23.17	Three times in the year shall all your males appear before the Lord 
EXO.23.19	“You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.
EXO.23.20	“Behold, I send an angel before you, to guard you on the way and to bring you to the place which I have prepared. 
EXO.23.21	Give heed to him and hearken to his voice, do not rebel against him, for he will not pardon your transgression; for my name is in him.
EXO.23.22	“But if you hearken attentively to his voice and do all that I say, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries.
EXO.23.23	“When my angel goes before you, and brings you in to the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, and I blot them out, 
EXO.23.24	you shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do according to their works, but you shall utterly overthrow them and break their pillars in pieces. 
EXO.23.25	You shall serve the 
EXO.23.26	None shall cast her young or be barren in your land; I will fulfil the number of your days. 
EXO.23.27	I will send my terror before you, and will throw into confusion all the people against whom you shall come, and I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you. 
EXO.23.28	And I will send hornets before you, which shall drive out Hivite, Canaanite, and Hittite from before you. 
EXO.23.29	I will not drive them out from before you in one year, lest the land become desolate and the wild beasts multiply against you. 
EXO.23.30	Little by little I will drive them out from before you, until you are increased and possess the land. 
EXO.23.31	And I will set your bounds from the Red Sea to the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the Euphrates; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you shall drive them out before you. 
EXO.23.32	You shall make no covenant with them or with their gods. 
EXO.23.33	They shall not dwell in your land, lest they make you sin against me; for if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.”
EXO.24.1	And he said to Moses, “Come up to the 
EXO.24.2	Moses alone shall come near to the 
EXO.24.3	Moses came and told the people all the words of the 
EXO.24.4	And Moses wrote all the words of the 
EXO.24.5	And he sent young men of the people of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the 
EXO.24.6	And Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the blood he threw against the altar. 
EXO.24.7	Then he took the book of the covenant, and read it in the hearing of the people; and they said, “All that the 
EXO.24.8	 And Moses took the blood and threw it upon the people, and said, “Behold the blood of the covenant which the 
EXO.24.9	Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up, 
EXO.24.10	and they saw the God of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were a pavement of sapphire stone, like the very heaven for clearness. 
EXO.24.11	And he did not lay his hand on the chief men of the people of Israel; they beheld God, and ate and drank.
EXO.24.13	So Moses rose with his servant Joshua, and Moses went up into the mountain of God. 
EXO.24.14	And he said to the elders, “Tarry here for us, until we come to you again; and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you; whoever has a cause, let him go to them.”
EXO.24.15	Then Moses went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain. 
EXO.24.16	The glory of the 
EXO.24.17	Now the appearance of the glory of the

EXO.25.2	 “Speak to the people of Israel, that they take for me an offering; from every man whose heart makes him willing you shall receive the offering for me. 
EXO.25.3	And this is the offering which you shall receive from them: gold, silver, and bronze, 
EXO.25.4	blue and purple and scarlet stuff and fine twined linen, goats' hair, 
EXO.25.5	tanned rams' skins, goatskins, acacia wood, 
EXO.25.6	oil for the lamps, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense, 
EXO.25.7	onyx stones, and stones for setting, for the ephod and for the breastpiece. 
EXO.25.8	And let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell in their midst. 
EXO.25.9	According to all that I show you concerning the pattern of the tabernacle, and of all its furniture, so you shall make it.
EXO.25.11	And you shall overlay it with pure gold, within and without shall you overlay it, and you shall make upon it a molding of gold round about.

EXO.25.13	You shall make poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold. 
EXO.25.14	And you shall put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, to carry the ark by them. 
EXO.25.15	The poles shall remain in the rings of the ark; they shall not be taken from it. 
EXO.25.16	And you shall put into the ark the testimony which I shall give you. 
EXO.25.17	Then you shall make a mercy seat
EXO.25.18	And you shall make two cherubim of gold; of hammered work shall you make them, on the two ends of the mercy seat. 
EXO.25.19	Make one cherub on the one end, and one cherub on the other end; of one piece with the mercy seat shall you make the cherubim on its two ends. 
EXO.25.20	The cherubim shall spread out their wings above, overshadowing the mercy seat with their wings, their faces one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubim be. 
EXO.25.21	And you shall put the mercy seat on the top of the ark; and in the ark you shall put the testimony that I shall give you. 
EXO.25.22	There I will meet with you, and from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim that are upon the ark of the testimony, I will speak with you of all that I will give you in commandment for the people of Israel.
EXO.25.24	You shall overlay it with pure gold, and make a molding of gold around it. 
EXO.25.25	And you shall make around it a frame a handbreadth wide, and a molding of gold around the frame. 
EXO.25.26	And you shall make for it four rings of gold, and fasten the rings to the four corners at its four legs. 
EXO.25.27	Close to the frame the rings shall lie, as holders for the poles to carry the table. 
EXO.25.28	You shall make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold, and the table shall be carried with these. 
EXO.25.29	And you shall make its plates and dishes for incense, and its flagons and bowls with which to pour libations; of pure gold you shall make them.

EXO.25.36	Their capitals and their branches shall be of one piece with it, the whole of it one piece of hammered work of pure gold. 
EXO.25.37	And you shall make the seven lamps for it; and the lamps shall be set up so as to give light upon the space in front of it. 
EXO.25.38	Its snuffers and their trays shall be of pure gold. 
EXO.25.39	Of a talent of pure gold shall it be made, with all these utensils.

EXO.30.36	and you shall beat some of it very small, and put part of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting where I shall meet with you; it shall be for you most holy. 
EXO.30.37	And the incense which you shall make according to its composition, you shall not make for yourselves; it shall be for you holy to the 
EXO.30.38	Whoever makes any like it to use as perfume shall be cut off from his people.”
EXO.31.2	“See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: 
EXO.31.3	and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with ability and intelligence, with knowledge and all craftsmanship, 
EXO.31.4	to devise artistic designs, to work in gold, silver, and bronze, 
EXO.31.5	in cutting stones for setting, and in carving wood, for work in every craft. 
EXO.31.6	And behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and I have given to all able men ability, that they may make all that I have commanded you: 
EXO.31.7	the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereon, and all the furnishings of the tent, 
EXO.31.8	the table and its utensils, and the pure lampstand with all its utensils, and the altar of incense, 
EXO.31.9	and the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the laver and its base,

EXO.31.11	and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense for the holy place. According to all that I have commanded you they shall do.”
EXO.31.13	“Say to the people of Israel, ‘You shall keep my sabbaths, for this is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I, the 
EXO.31.14	You shall keep the sabbath, because it is holy for you; every one who profanes it shall be put to death; whoever does any work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 
EXO.31.15	Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the 
EXO.31.16	Therefore the people of Israel shall keep the sabbath, observing the sabbath throughout their generations, as a perpetual covenant. 
EXO.31.17	It is a sign for ever between me and the people of Israel that in six days the 
EXO.31.18	And he gave to Moses, when he had made an end of speaking with him upon Mount Sinai, the two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.
EXO.32.2	And Aaron said to them, “Take off the rings of gold which are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me.” 
EXO.32.3	So all the people took off the rings of gold which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron. 
EXO.32.4	And he received the gold at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, and made a molten calf; and they said, “These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!” 
EXO.32.5	When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation and said, “Tomorrow shall be a feast to the 
EXO.32.6	 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.
EXO.32.7	And the 
EXO.32.8	they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them; they have made for themselves a molten calf, and have worshiped it and sacrificed to it, and said, ‘These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!’ ” 
EXO.32.9	 And the 
EXO.32.10	now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them and I may consume them; but of you I will make a great nation.”
EXO.32.11	But Moses besought the 
EXO.32.12	Why should the Egyptians say, ‘With evil intent did he bring them forth, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth’? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people. 
EXO.32.13	Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou didst swear by thine own self, and didst say to them, ‘I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have promised I will give to your descendants, and they shall inherit it for ever.’ ” 
EXO.32.14	And the 
EXO.32.15	And Moses turned, and went down from the mountain with the two tables of the testimony in his hands, tables that were written on both sides; on the one side and on the other were they written. 
EXO.32.16	And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables. 
EXO.32.17	When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “There is a noise of war in the camp.” 
EXO.32.18	But he said, “It is not the sound of shouting for victory, or the sound of the cry of defeat, but the sound of singing that I hear.” 
EXO.32.19	And as soon as he came near the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, Moses' anger burned hot, and he threw the tables out of his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain. 
EXO.32.20	And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, and ground it to powder, and scattered it upon the water, and made the people of Israel drink it.
EXO.32.21	And Moses said to Aaron, “What did this people do to you that you have brought a great sin upon them?” 
EXO.32.22	And Aaron said, “Let not the anger of my lord burn hot; you know the people, that they are set on evil. 
EXO.32.23	 For they said to me, ‘Make us gods, who shall go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.’ 
EXO.32.24	And I said to them, ‘Let any who have gold take it off’; so they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and there came out this calf.”
EXO.32.25	And when Moses saw that the people had broken loose (for Aaron had let them break loose, to their shame among their enemies), 
EXO.32.26	then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, “Who is on the 
EXO.32.27	And he said to them, “Thus says the 
EXO.32.28	And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. 
EXO.32.29	And Moses said, “Today you have ordained yourselves
EXO.32.30	On the morrow Moses said to the people, “You have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to the 
EXO.32.31	So Moses returned to the 
EXO.32.32	 But now, if thou wilt forgive their sin—and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.” 
EXO.32.33	But the 
EXO.32.34	But now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you; behold, my angel shall go before you. Nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.”
EXO.32.35	And the 
EXO.33.1	The 
EXO.33.2	And I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
EXO.33.3	 Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; but I will not go up among you, lest I consume you in the way, for you are a stiff-necked people.”
EXO.33.4	When the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned; and no man put on his ornaments. 
EXO.33.5	For the 
EXO.33.6	Therefore the people of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments, from Mount Horeb onward.
EXO.33.7	Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, far off from the camp; and he called it the tent of meeting. And every one who sought the 
EXO.33.8	Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people rose up, and every man stood at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he had gone into the tent. 
EXO.33.9	When Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the door of the tent, and the 
EXO.33.10	And when all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the door of the tent, all the people would rise up and worship, every man at his tent door. 
EXO.33.11	 Thus the 
EXO.33.12	Moses said to the 
EXO.33.13	Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thy sight, show me now thy ways, that I may know thee and find favor in thy sight. Consider too that this nation is thy people.” 
EXO.33.14	And he said, “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.” 
EXO.33.15	And he said to him, “If thy presence will not go with me, do not carry us up from here. 
EXO.33.16	For how shall it be known that I have found favor in thy sight, I and thy people? Is it not in thy going with us, so that we are distinct, I and thy people, from all other people that are upon the face of the earth?”
EXO.33.17	And the 
EXO.33.18	Moses said, “I pray thee, show me thy glory.” 
EXO.33.19	 And he said, “I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim before you my name ‘The 
EXO.33.20	But,” he said, “you cannot see my face; for man shall not see me and live.” 
EXO.33.21	And the 
EXO.33.22	and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by; 
EXO.33.23	then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back; but my face shall not be seen.”
EXO.34.1	The 
EXO.34.2	Be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain. 
EXO.34.3	No man shall come up with you, and let no man be seen throughout all the mountain; let no flocks or herds feed before that mountain.” 
EXO.34.4	So Moses cut two tables of stone like the first; and he rose early in the morning and went up on Mount Sinai, as the 
EXO.34.5	And the 
EXO.34.6	 The 
EXO.34.7	keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation.” 
EXO.34.8	And Moses made haste to bow his head toward the earth, and worshiped. 
EXO.34.9	And he said, “If now I have found favor in thy sight, O Lord, let the Lord, I pray thee, go in the midst of us, although it is a stiff-necked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thy inheritance.”
EXO.34.10	And he said, “Behold, I make a covenant. Before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been wrought in all the earth or in any nation; and all the people among whom you are shall see the work of the 
EXO.34.11	“Observe what I command you this day. Behold, I will drive out before you the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
EXO.34.12	Take heed to yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither you go, lest it become a snare in the midst of you. 
EXO.34.13	You shall tear down their altars, and break their pillars, and cut down their Asherim 
EXO.34.14	 (for you shall worship no other god, for the 
EXO.34.15	lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and when they play the harlot after their gods and sacrifice to their gods and one invites you, you eat of his sacrifice, 
EXO.34.16	and you take of their daughters for your sons, and their daughters play the harlot after their gods and make your sons play the harlot after their gods.
EXO.34.19	 All that opens the womb is mine, all your male
EXO.34.20	The firstling of an ass you shall redeem with a lamb, or if you will not redeem it you shall break its neck. All the first-born of your sons you shall redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.
EXO.34.22	 And you shall observe the feast of weeks, the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end. 
EXO.34.23	Three times in the year shall all your males appear before the 
EXO.34.24	For I will cast out nations before you, and enlarge your borders; neither shall any man desire your land, when you go up to appear before the 
EXO.34.26	 The first of the first fruits of your ground you shall bring to the house of the 
EXO.34.27	And the 
EXO.34.28	And he was there with the 
EXO.34.30	And when Aaron and all the people of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him. 
EXO.34.31	But Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses talked with them. 
EXO.34.32	And afterward all the people of Israel came near, and he gave them in commandment all that the 
EXO.34.33	And when Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face; 
EXO.34.34	but whenever Moses went in before the 
EXO.34.35	the people of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone; and Moses would put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.
EXO.35.1	Moses assembled all the congregation of the people of Israel, and said to them, “These are the things which the 
EXO.35.2	 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day you shall have a holy sabbath of solemn rest to the 
EXO.35.3	you shall kindle no fire in all your habitations on the sabbath day.”
EXO.35.5	Take from among you an offering to the 
EXO.35.6	blue and purple and scarlet stuff and fine twined linen; goats' hair, 
EXO.35.7	tanned rams' skins, and goatskins; acacia wood, 
EXO.35.8	oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense, 
EXO.35.9	and onyx stones and stones for setting, for the ephod and for the breastpiece.
EXO.35.10	“And let every able man among you come and make all that the 
EXO.35.11	its tent and its covering, its hooks and its frames, its bars, its pillars, and its bases; 
EXO.35.12	the ark with its poles, the mercy seat, and the veil of the screen; 
EXO.35.13	the table with its poles and all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence; 
EXO.35.14	the lampstand also for the light, with its utensils and its lamps, and the oil for the light; 
EXO.35.15	and the altar of incense, with its poles, and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and the screen for the door, at the door of the tabernacle; 
EXO.35.16	the altar of burnt offering, with its grating of bronze, its poles, and all its utensils, the laver and its base; 
EXO.35.17	the hangings of the court, its pillars and its bases, and the screen for the gate of the court; 
EXO.35.18	the pegs of the tabernacle and the pegs of the court, and their cords; 
EXO.35.19	the finely wrought garments for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, for their service as priests.”
EXO.35.20	Then all the congregation of the people of Israel departed from the presence of Moses. 
EXO.35.21	And they came, every one whose heart stirred him, and every one whose spirit moved him, and brought the 
EXO.35.22	So they came, both men and women; all who were of a willing heart brought brooches and earrings and signet rings and armlets, all sorts of gold objects, every man dedicating an offering of gold to the 
EXO.35.23	And every man with whom was found blue or purple or scarlet stuff or fine linen or goats' hair or tanned rams' skins or goatskins, brought them. 
EXO.35.24	Every one who could make an offering of silver or bronze brought it as the 
EXO.35.25	And all women who had ability spun with their hands, and brought what they had spun in blue and purple and scarlet stuff and fine twined linen; 
EXO.35.26	all the women whose hearts were moved with ability spun the goats' hair. 
EXO.35.27	And the leaders brought onyx stones and stones to be set, for the ephod and for the breastpiece, 
EXO.35.28	and spices and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense. 
EXO.35.29	All the men and women, the people of Israel, whose heart moved them to bring anything for the work which the 
EXO.35.31	and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with ability, with intelligence, with knowledge, and with all craftsmanship, 
EXO.35.32	to devise artistic designs, to work in gold and silver and bronze, 
EXO.35.33	in cutting stones for setting, and in carving wood, for work in every skilled craft. 
EXO.35.34	And he has inspired him to teach, both him and Oholiab the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan. 
EXO.35.35	He has filled them with ability to do every sort of work done by a craftsman or by a designer or by an embroiderer in blue and purple and scarlet stuff and fine twined linen, or by a weaver—by any sort of workman or skilled designer.
EXO.36.1	Bezalel and Oholiab and every able man in whom the 
EXO.36.2	And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every able man in whose mind the 
EXO.36.3	and they received from Moses all the freewill offering which the people of Israel had brought for doing the work on the sanctuary. They still kept bringing him freewill offerings every morning, 
EXO.36.4	so that all the able men who were doing every sort of task on the sanctuary came, each from the task that he was doing, 
EXO.36.5	and said to Moses, “The people bring much more than enough for doing the work which the 
EXO.36.6	So Moses gave command, and word was proclaimed throughout the camp, “Let neither man nor woman do anything more for the offering for the sanctuary.” So the people were restrained from bringing; 
EXO.36.7	for the stuff they had was sufficient to do all the work, and more.
EXO.36.9	The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits; all the curtains had the same measure.
EXO.36.10	And he coupled five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he coupled to one another. 
EXO.36.11	And he made loops of blue on the edge of the outmost curtain of the first set; likewise he made them on the edge of the outmost curtain of the second set; 
EXO.36.12	he made fifty loops on the one curtain, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set; the loops were opposite one another. 
EXO.36.13	And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to the other with clasps; so the tabernacle was one whole.
EXO.36.14	He also made curtains of goats' hair for a tent over the tabernacle; he made eleven curtains. 
EXO.36.15	The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits; the eleven curtains had the same measure. 
EXO.36.16	He coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves. 
EXO.36.17	And he made fifty loops on the edge of the outmost curtain of the one set, and fifty loops on the edge of the other connecting curtain. 
EXO.36.18	And he made fifty clasps of bronze to couple the tent together that it might be one whole. 
EXO.36.19	And he made for the tent a covering of tanned rams' skins and goatskins.
EXO.36.21	Ten cubits was the length of a frame, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each frame. 
EXO.36.22	Each frame had two tenons, for fitting together; he did this for all the frames of the tabernacle. 
EXO.36.23	The frames for the tabernacle he made thus: twenty frames for the south side; 
EXO.36.24	and he made forty bases of silver under the twenty frames, two bases under one frame for its two tenons, and two bases under another frame for its two tenons. 
EXO.36.25	And for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty frames 
EXO.36.26	and their forty bases of silver, two bases under one frame and two bases under another frame. 
EXO.36.27	And for the rear of the tabernacle westward he made six frames. 
EXO.36.28	And he made two frames for corners of the tabernacle in the rear. 
EXO.36.29	And they were separate beneath, but joined at the top, at the first ring; he made two of them thus, for the two corners. 
EXO.36.30	There were eight frames with their bases of silver: sixteen bases, under every frame two bases.
EXO.36.31	And he made bars of acacia wood, five for the frames of the one side of the tabernacle, 
EXO.36.32	and five bars for the frames of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the frames of the tabernacle at the rear westward. 
EXO.36.33	And he made the middle bar to pass through from end to end halfway up the frames. 
EXO.36.34	And he overlaid the frames with gold, and made their rings of gold for holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.
EXO.36.36	And for it he made four pillars of acacia, and overlaid them with gold; their hooks were of gold, and he cast for them four bases of silver. 
EXO.36.37	He also made a screen for the door of the tent, of blue and purple and scarlet stuff and fine twined linen, embroidered with needlework; 
EXO.36.38	and its five pillars with their hooks. He overlaid their capitals, and their fillets were of gold, but their five bases were of bronze.
EXO.37.2	And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a molding of gold around it. 
EXO.37.3	And he cast for it four rings of gold for its four corners, two rings on its one side and two rings on its other side. 
EXO.37.4	And he made poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold, 
EXO.37.5	and put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, to carry the ark. 
EXO.37.6	And he made a mercy seat of pure gold; two cubits and a half was its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth. 
EXO.37.7	And he made two cherubim of hammered gold; on the two ends of the mercy seat he made them, 
EXO.37.8	one cherub on the one end, and one cherub on the other end; of one piece with the mercy seat he made the cherubim on its two ends. 
EXO.37.9	The cherubim spread out their wings above, overshadowing the mercy seat with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the mercy seat were the faces of the cherubim.
EXO.37.11	and he overlaid it with pure gold, and made a molding of gold around it. 
EXO.37.12	And he made around it a frame a handbreadth wide, and made a molding of gold around the frame. 
EXO.37.13	He cast for it four rings of gold, and fastened the rings to the four corners at its four legs. 
EXO.37.14	Close to the frame were the rings, as holders for the poles to carry the table. 
EXO.37.15	He made the poles of acacia wood to carry the table, and overlaid them with gold. 
EXO.37.16	And he made the vessels of pure gold which were to be upon the table, its plates and dishes for incense, and its bowls and flagons with which to pour libations.
EXO.37.18	And there were six branches going out of its sides, three branches of the lampstand out of one side of it and three branches of the lampstand out of the other side of it; 
EXO.37.19	three cups made like almonds, each with capital and flower, on one branch, and three cups made like almonds, each with capital and flower, on the other branch—so for the six branches going out of the lampstand. 
EXO.37.20	And on the lampstand itself were four cups made like almonds, with their capitals and flowers, 
EXO.37.21	and a capital of one piece with it under each pair of the six branches going out of it. 
EXO.37.22	Their capitals and their branches were of one piece with it; the whole of it was one piece of hammered work of pure gold. 
EXO.37.23	And he made its seven lamps and its snuffers and its trays of pure gold. 
EXO.37.24	He made it and all its utensils of a talent of pure gold.
EXO.37.26	He overlaid it with pure gold, its top, and its sides round about, and its horns; and he made a molding of gold round about it, 
EXO.37.27	and made two rings of gold on it under its molding, on two opposite sides of it, as holders for the poles with which to carry it. 
EXO.37.28	And he made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold.
EXO.37.29	He made the holy anointing oil also, and the pure fragrant incense, blended as by the perfumer.
EXO.38.2	He made horns for it on its four corners; its horns were of one piece with it, and he overlaid it with bronze. 
EXO.38.3	And he made all the utensils of the altar, the pots, the shovels, the basins, the forks, and the firepans; all its utensils he made of bronze. 
EXO.38.4	And he made for the altar a grating, a network of bronze, under its ledge, extending halfway down. 
EXO.38.5	He cast four rings on the four corners of the bronze grating as holders for the poles; 
EXO.38.6	he made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with bronze. 
EXO.38.7	And he put the poles through the rings on the sides of the altar, to carry it with them; he made it hollow, with boards.
EXO.38.10	their pillars were twenty and their bases twenty, of bronze, but the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver. 
EXO.38.11	And for the north side a hundred cubits, their pillars twenty, their bases twenty, of bronze, but the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver. 
EXO.38.12	And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver. 
EXO.38.13	And for the front to the east, fifty cubits. 
EXO.38.14	The hangings for one side of the gate were fifteen cubits, with three pillars and three bases. 
EXO.38.15	And so for the other side; on this hand and that hand by the gate of the court were hangings of fifteen cubits, with three pillars and three bases. 
EXO.38.16	All the hangings round about the court were of fine twined linen. 
EXO.38.17	And the bases for the pillars were of bronze, but the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver; the overlaying of their capitals was also of silver, and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver. 
EXO.38.18	And the screen for the gate of the court was embroidered with needlework in blue and purple and scarlet stuff and fine twined linen; it was twenty cubits long and five cubits high in its breadth, corresponding to the hangings of the court. 
EXO.38.19	And their pillars were four; their four bases were of bronze, their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their capitals and their fillets of silver. 
EXO.38.20	And all the pegs for the tabernacle and for the court round about were of bronze.
EXO.38.21	This is the sum of the things for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the testimony, as they were counted at the commandment of Moses, for the work of the Levites under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 
EXO.38.22	Bezalel the son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the 
EXO.38.23	and with him was Oholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, a craftsman and designer and embroiderer in blue and purple and scarlet stuff and fine twined linen.
EXO.38.24	All the gold that was used for the work, in all the construction of the sanctuary, the gold from the offering, was twenty-nine talents and seven hundred and thirty shekels, by the shekel of the sanctuary. 
EXO.38.25	 And the silver from those of the congregation who were numbered was a hundred talents and a thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels, by the shekel of the sanctuary: 
EXO.38.26	a beka a head (that is, half a shekel, by the shekel of the sanctuary), for every one who was numbered in the census, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred and three thousand, five hundred and fifty men. 
EXO.38.27	The hundred talents of silver were for casting the bases of the sanctuary, and the bases of the veil; a hundred bases for the hundred talents, a talent for a base. 
EXO.38.28	And of the thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their capitals and made fillets for them. 
EXO.38.29	And the bronze that was contributed was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels; 
EXO.38.30	with it he made the bases for the door of the tent of meeting, the bronze altar and the bronze grating for it and all the utensils of the altar, 
EXO.38.31	the bases round about the court, and the bases of the gate of the court, all the pegs of the tabernacle, and all the pegs round about the court.
EXO.39.1	And of the blue and purple and scarlet stuff they made finely wrought garments, for ministering in the holy place; they made the holy garments for Aaron; as the 
EXO.39.3	And gold leaf was hammered out and cut into threads to work into the blue and purple and the scarlet stuff, and into the fine twined linen, in skilled design. 
EXO.39.4	They made for the ephod shoulder-pieces, joined to it at its two edges. 
EXO.39.5	And the skilfully woven band upon it, to gird it on, was of the same materials and workmanship, of gold, blue and purple and scarlet stuff, and fine twined linen; as the 
EXO.39.6	The onyx stones were prepared, enclosed in settings of gold filigree and engraved like the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the sons of Israel. 
EXO.39.7	And he set them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, to be stones of remembrance for the sons of Israel; as the 
EXO.39.9	It was square; the breastpiece was made double, a span its length and a span its breadth when doubled. 
EXO.39.10	And they set in it four rows of stones. A row of sardius, topaz, and carbuncle was the first row; 
EXO.39.11	and the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond; 
EXO.39.12	and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; 
EXO.39.13	and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper; they were enclosed in settings of gold filigree. 
EXO.39.14	There were twelve stones with their names according to the names of the sons of Israel; they were like signets, each engraved with its name, for the twelve tribes. 
EXO.39.15	And they made on the breastpiece twisted chains like cords, of pure gold; 
EXO.39.16	and they made two settings of gold filigree and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two edges of the breastpiece; 
EXO.39.17	and they put the two cords of gold in the two rings at the edges of the breastpiece. 
EXO.39.18	Two ends of the two cords they had attached to the two settings of filigree; thus they attached it in front to the shoulder-pieces of the ephod. 
EXO.39.19	Then they made two rings of gold, and put them at the two ends of the breastpiece, on its inside edge next to the ephod. 
EXO.39.20	And they made two rings of gold, and attached them in front to the lower part of the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod, at its joining above the skilfully woven band of the ephod. 
EXO.39.21	And they bound the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, so that it should lie upon the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastpiece should not come loose from the ephod; as the 
EXO.39.23	and the opening of the robe in it was like the opening in a garment, with a binding around the opening, that it might not be torn. 
EXO.39.24	On the skirts of the robe they made pomegranates of blue and purple and scarlet stuff and fine twined linen. 
EXO.39.25	They also made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the skirts of the robe round about, between the pomegranates; 
EXO.39.26	a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate round about upon the skirts of the robe for ministering; as the 
EXO.39.28	and the turban of fine linen, and the caps of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twined linen, 
EXO.39.29	and the girdle of fine twined linen and of blue and purple and scarlet stuff, embroidered with needlework; as the 
EXO.39.31	And they tied to it a lace of blue, to fasten it on the turban above; as the 
EXO.39.32	Thus all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting was finished; and the people of Israel had done according to all that the 
EXO.39.33	And they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its utensils, its hooks, its frames, its bars, its pillars, and its bases; 
EXO.39.34	the covering of tanned rams' skins and goatskins, and the veil of the screen; 
EXO.39.35	the ark of the testimony with its poles and the mercy seat; 
EXO.39.36	 the table with all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence; 
EXO.39.37	the lampstand of pure gold and its lamps with the lamps set and all its utensils, and the oil for the light; 
EXO.39.38	the golden altar, the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and the screen for the door of the tent; 
EXO.39.39	the bronze altar, and its grating of bronze, its poles, and all its utensils; the laver and its base; 
EXO.39.40	the hangings of the court, its pillars, and its bases, and the screen for the gate of the court, its cords, and its pegs; and all the utensils for the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting; 
EXO.39.41	the finely worked garments for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons to serve as priests. 
EXO.39.42	According to all that the 
EXO.39.43	And Moses saw all the work, and behold, they had done it; as the 
EXO.40.1	The 
EXO.40.2	“On the first day of the first month you shall erect the tabernacle of the tent of meeting. 
EXO.40.3	And you shall put in it the ark of the testimony, and you shall screen the ark with the veil. 
EXO.40.4	And you shall bring in the table, and set its arrangements in order; and you shall bring in the lampstand, and set up its lamps. 
EXO.40.5	And you shall put the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and set up the screen for the door of the tabernacle. 
EXO.40.6	You shall set the altar of burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, 
EXO.40.7	and place the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it. 
EXO.40.8	And you shall set up the court round about, and hang up the screen for the gate of the court. 
EXO.40.9	Then you shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it, and consecrate it and all its furniture; and it shall become holy. 
EXO.40.10	You shall also anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and consecrate the altar; and the altar shall be most holy. 
EXO.40.11	You shall also anoint the laver and its base, and consecrate it. 
EXO.40.12	Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tent of meeting, and shall wash them with water, 
EXO.40.13	and put upon Aaron the holy garments, and you shall anoint him and consecrate him, that he may serve me as priest. 
EXO.40.14	You shall bring his sons also and put coats on them, 
EXO.40.15	and anoint them, as you anointed their father, that they may serve me as priests: and their anointing shall admit them to a perpetual priesthood throughout their generations.”
EXO.40.16	Thus did Moses; according to all that the 
EXO.40.17	And in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, the tabernacle was erected. 
EXO.40.18	Moses erected the tabernacle; he laid its bases, and set up its frames, and put in its poles, and raised up its pillars; 
EXO.40.19	and he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent over it, as the 
EXO.40.20	And he took the testimony and put it into the ark, and put the poles on the ark, and set the mercy seat above on the ark; 
EXO.40.21	and he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony; as the 
EXO.40.22	And he put the table in the tent of meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil, 
EXO.40.23	 and set the bread in order on it before the 
EXO.40.24	And he put the lampstand in the tent of meeting, opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle, 
EXO.40.25	and set up the lamps before the 
EXO.40.26	And he put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil, 
EXO.40.27	and burnt fragrant incense upon it; as the 
EXO.40.28	And he put in place the screen for the door of the tabernacle. 
EXO.40.29	And he set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the cereal offering; as the 
EXO.40.30	 And he set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it for washing, 
EXO.40.31	with which Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet; 
EXO.40.32	when they went into the tent of meeting, and when they approached the altar, they washed; as the 
EXO.40.33	And he erected the court round the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.
EXO.40.35	And Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting, because the cloud abode upon it, and the glory of the 
EXO.40.36	Throughout all their journeys, whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the people of Israel would go onward; 
EXO.40.37	but if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not go onward till the day that it was taken up. 
EXO.40.38	For throughout all their journeys the cloud of the 
LEV.1.1	The 
LEV.1.2	“Speak to the people of Israel, and say to them, When any man of you brings an offering to the 
LEV.1.3	“If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he shall offer a male without blemish; he shall offer it at the door of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before the 
LEV.1.4	he shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt offering, and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. 
LEV.1.5	Then he shall kill the bull before the 
LEV.1.6	And he shall flay the burnt offering and cut it into pieces; 
LEV.1.7	and the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar, and lay wood in order upon the fire; 
LEV.1.8	and Aaron's sons the priests shall lay the pieces, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire upon the altar; 
LEV.1.9	but its entrails and its legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall burn the whole on the altar, as a burnt offering, an offering by fire, a pleasing odor to the 
LEV.1.10	“If his gift for a burnt offering is from the flock, from the sheep or goats, he shall offer a male without blemish; 
LEV.1.11	and he shall kill it on the north side of the altar before the

LEV.1.13	but the entrails and the legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall offer the whole, and burn it on the altar; it is a burnt offering, an offering by fire, a pleasing odor to the 
LEV.1.14	“If his offering to the

LEV.1.17	he shall tear it by its wings, but shall not divide it asunder. And the priest shall burn it on the altar, upon the wood that is on the fire; it is a burnt offering, an offering by fire, a pleasing odor to the 
LEV.2.1	“When any one brings a cereal offering as an offering to the 
LEV.2.2	and bring it to Aaron's sons the priests. And he shall take from it a handful of the fine flour and oil, with all of its frankincense; and the priest shall burn this as its memorial portion upon the altar, an offering by fire, a pleasing odor to the 
LEV.2.3	And what is left of the cereal offering shall be for Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the offerings by fire to the 
LEV.2.4	“When you bring a cereal offering baked in the oven as an offering, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil.

LEV.3.2	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting; and Aaron's sons the priests shall throw the blood against the altar round about. 
LEV.3.3	And from the sacrifice of the peace offering, as an offering by fire to the 
LEV.3.4	and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the appendage of the liver which he shall take away with the kidneys.

LEV.4.1	And the 
LEV.4.2	 “Say to the people of Israel, If any one sins unwittingly in any of the things which the 
LEV.4.3	if it is the anointed priest who sins, thus bringing guilt on the people, then let him offer for the sin which he has committed a young bull without blemish to the 
LEV.4.4	He shall bring the bull to the door of the tent of meeting before the 
LEV.4.5	And the anointed priest shall take some of the blood of the bull and bring it to the tent of meeting;

LEV.4.7	And the priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense before the 
LEV.4.8	And all the fat of the bull of the sin offering he shall take from it, the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails, 
LEV.4.9	and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the appendage of the liver which he shall take away with the kidneys 
LEV.4.10	(just as these are taken from the ox of the sacrifice of the peace offerings), and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of burnt offering. 
LEV.4.11	But the skin of the bull and all its flesh, with its head, its legs, its entrails, and its dung, 
LEV.4.12	the whole bull he shall carry forth outside the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and shall burn it on a fire of wood; where the ashes are poured out it shall be burned.
LEV.4.14	when the sin which they have committed becomes known, the assembly shall offer a young bull for a sin offering and bring it before the tent of meeting; 
LEV.4.15	and the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bull before the 
LEV.4.16	Then the anointed priest shall bring some of the blood of the bull to the tent of meeting, 
LEV.4.17	and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the 
LEV.4.18	And he shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar which is in the tent of meeting before the 
LEV.4.19	And all its fat he shall take from it and burn upon the altar. 
LEV.4.20	Thus shall he do with the bull; as he did with the bull of the sin offering, so shall he do with this; and the priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven. 
LEV.4.21	And he shall carry forth the bull outside the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bull; it is the sin offering for the assembly.
LEV.4.22	“When a ruler sins, doing unwittingly any one of all the things which the 
LEV.4.23	if the sin which he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring as his offering a goat, a male without blemish, 
LEV.4.24	and shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the 
LEV.4.25	Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering. 
LEV.4.26	And all its fat he shall burn on the altar, like the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings; so the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin, and he shall be forgiven.
LEV.4.27	“If any one of the common people sins unwittingly in doing any one of the things which the 
LEV.4.28	when the sin which he has committed is made known to him he shall bring for his offering a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he has committed. 
LEV.4.29	And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering, and kill the sin offering in the place of burnt offering. 
LEV.4.30	And the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar. 
LEV.4.31	And all its fat he shall remove, as the fat is removed from the peace offerings, and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a pleasing odor to the 
LEV.4.32	“If he brings a lamb as his offering for a sin offering, he shall bring a female without blemish, 
LEV.4.33	and lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and kill it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering. 
LEV.4.34	Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar. 
LEV.4.35	And all its fat he shall remove as the fat of the lamb is removed from the sacrifice of peace offerings, and the priest shall burn it on the altar, upon the offerings by fire to the 
LEV.5.1	“If any one sins in that he hears a public adjuration to testify and though he is a witness, whether he has seen or come to know the matter, yet does not speak, he shall bear his inquity. 
LEV.5.2	Or if any one touches an unclean thing, whether the carcass of an unclean beast or a carcass of unclean cattle or a carcass of unclean swarming things, and it is hidden from him, and he has become unclean, he shall be guilty. 
LEV.5.3	Or if he touches human uncleanness, of whatever sort the uncleanness may be with which one becomes unclean, and it is hidden from him, when he comes to know it he shall be guilty. 
LEV.5.4	Or if any one utters with his lips a rash oath to do evil or to do good, any sort of rash oath that men swear, and it is hidden from him, when he comes to know it he shall in any of these be guilty. 
LEV.5.5	When a man is guilty in any of these, he shall confess the sin he has committed, 
LEV.5.6	and he shall bring his guilt offering to the 
LEV.5.7	“But if he cannot afford a lamb, then he shall bring, as his guilt offering to the 
LEV.5.8	He shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer first the one for the sin offering; he shall wring its head from its neck, but shall not sever it, 
LEV.5.9	and he shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, while the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering. 
LEV.5.10	Then he shall offer the second for a burnt offering according to the ordinance; and the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he has committed, and he shall be forgiven.
LEV.5.11	“But if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then he shall bring, as his offering for the sin which he has committed, a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil upon it, and shall put no frankincense on it, for it is a sin offering. 
LEV.5.12	And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take a handful of it as its memorial portion and burn this on the altar, upon the offerings by fire to the 
LEV.5.13	Thus the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he has committed in any one of these things, and he shall be forgiven. And the remainder shall be for the priest, as in the cereal offering.”
LEV.5.14	The 
LEV.5.15	“If any one commits a breach of faith and sins unwittingly in any of the holy things of the 
LEV.5.16	He shall also make restitution for what he has done amiss in the holy thing, and shall add a fifth to it and give it to the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and he shall be forgiven.
LEV.5.17	“If any one sins, doing any of the things which the 
LEV.5.18	He shall bring to the priest a ram without blemish out of the flock, valued by you at the price for a guilt offering, and the priest shall make atonement for him for the error which he committed unwittingly, and he shall be forgiven. 
LEV.5.19	It is a guilt offering; he is guilty before the 
LEV.6.2	“If any one sins and commits a breach of faith against the 
LEV.6.3	or has found what was lost and lied about it, swearing falsely—in any of all the things which men do and sin therein, 
LEV.6.4	when one has sinned and become guilty, he shall restore what he took by robbery, or what he got by oppression, or the deposit which was committed to him, or the lost thing which he found, 
LEV.6.5	or anything about which he has sworn falsely; he shall restore it in full, and shall add a fifth to it, and give it to him to whom it belongs, on the day of his guilt offering. 
LEV.6.6	And he shall bring to the priest his guilt offering to the 
LEV.6.7	and the priest shall make atonement for him before the 
LEV.6.9	“Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering. The burnt offering shall be on the hearth upon the altar all night until the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it. 
LEV.6.10	And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and put his linen breeches upon his body, and he shall take up the ashes to which the fire has consumed the burnt offering on the altar, and put them beside the altar. 
LEV.6.11	Then he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes outside the camp to a clean place. 
LEV.6.12	The fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it, it shall not go out; the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and he shall lay the burnt offering in order upon it, and shall burn on it the fat of the peace offerings. 
LEV.6.13	Fire shall be kept burning upon the altar continually; it shall not go out.
LEV.6.14	“And this is the law of the cereal offering. The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the 
LEV.6.15	And one shall take from it a handful of the fine flour of the cereal offering with its oil and all the frankincense which is on the cereal offering, and burn this as its memorial portion on the altar, a pleasing odor to the 
LEV.6.16	And the rest of it Aaron and his sons shall eat; it shall be eaten unleavened in a holy place; in the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it. 
LEV.6.17	It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their portion of my offerings by fire; it is a thing most holy, like the sin offering and the guilt offering. 
LEV.6.18	Every male among the children of Aaron may eat of it, as decreed for ever throughout your generations, from the 
LEV.6.19	The 
LEV.6.20	“This is the offering which Aaron and his sons shall offer to the 
LEV.6.21	It shall be made with oil on a griddle; you shall bring it well mixed, in baked
LEV.6.22	The priest from among Aaron's sons, who is anointed to succeed him, shall offer it to the 
LEV.6.23	Every cereal offering of a priest shall be wholly burned; it shall not be eaten.”
LEV.6.24	The 
LEV.6.25	“Say to Aaron and his sons, This is the law of the sin offering. In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the 
LEV.6.26	The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it; in a holy place it shall be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting. 
LEV.6.27	Whatever
LEV.6.28	And the earthen vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken; but if it is boiled in a bronze vessel, that shall be scoured, and rinsed in water. 
LEV.6.29	Every male among the priests may eat of it; it is most holy. 
LEV.6.30	But no sin offering shall be eaten from which any blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place; it shall be burned with fire.
LEV.7.1	“This is the law of the guilt offering. It is most holy; 
LEV.7.2	in the place where they kill the burnt offering they shall kill the guilt offering, and its blood shall be thrown on the altar round about. 
LEV.7.3	And all its fat shall be offered, the fat tail, the fat that covers the entrails, 
LEV.7.4	the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the appendage of the liver which he shall take away with the kidneys; 
LEV.7.5	the priest shall burn them on the altar as an offering by fire to the 
LEV.7.6	Every male among the priests may eat of it; it shall be eaten in a holy place; it is most holy. 
LEV.7.7	The guilt offering is like the sin offering, there is one law for them; the priest who makes atonement with it shall have it. 
LEV.7.8	And the priest who offers any man's burnt offering shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering which he has offered. 
LEV.7.9	And every cereal offering baked in the oven and all that is prepared on a pan or a griddle shall belong to the priest who offers it. 
LEV.7.10	And every cereal offering, mixed with oil or dry, shall be for all the sons of Aaron, one as well as another.
LEV.7.11	“And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings which one may offer to the 
LEV.7.12	If he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the thank offering unleavened cakes mixed with oil, unleavened wafers spread with oil, and cakes of fine flour well mixed with oil. 
LEV.7.13	With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving he shall bring his offering with cakes of leavened bread. 
LEV.7.14	And of such he shall offer one cake from each offering, as an offering to the 
LEV.7.15	And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his offering; he shall not leave any of it until the morning. 
LEV.7.16	But if the sacrifice of his offering is a votive offering or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice, and on the morrow what remains of it shall be eaten, 
LEV.7.17	but what remains of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned with fire. 
LEV.7.18	If any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offering is eaten on the third day, he who offers it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be credited to him; it shall be an abomination, and he who eats of it shall bear his iniquity.
LEV.7.19	“Flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burned with fire. All who are clean may eat flesh, 
LEV.7.20	but the person who eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of the 
LEV.7.21	And if any one touches an unclean thing, whether the uncleanness of man or an unclean beast or any unclean abomination, and then eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of the

LEV.7.23	“Say to the people of Israel, You shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat. 
LEV.7.24	The fat of an animal that dies of itself, and the fat of one that is torn by beasts, may be put to any other use, but on no account shall you eat it. 
LEV.7.25	For every person who eats of the fat of an animal of which an offering by fire is made to the 
LEV.7.26	Moreover you shall eat no blood whatever, whether of fowl or of animal, in any of your dwellings. 
LEV.7.27	Whoever eats any blood, that person shall be cut off from his people.”

LEV.7.29	“Say to the people of Israel, He that offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to the 
LEV.7.30	he shall bring with his own hands the offerings by fire to the 
LEV.7.31	The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast shall be for Aaron and his sons. 
LEV.7.32	And the right thigh you shall give to the priest as an offering from the sacrifice of your peace offerings; 
LEV.7.33	he among the sons of Aaron who offers the blood of the peace offerings and the fat shall have the right thigh for a portion. 
LEV.7.34	For the breast that is waved and the thigh that is offered I have taken from the people of Israel, out of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons, as a perpetual due from the people of Israel. 
LEV.7.35	This is the portion of Aaron and of his sons from the offerings made by fire to the 
LEV.7.36	the 
LEV.7.37	This is the law of the burnt offering, of the cereal offering, of the sin offering, of the guilt offering, of the consecration, and of the peace offerings, 
LEV.7.38	which the 
LEV.8.2	“Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bull of the sin offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread; 
LEV.8.3	and assemble all the congregation at the door of the tent of meeting.” 
LEV.8.4	And Moses did as the 
LEV.8.5	And Moses said to the congregation, “This is the thing which the 
LEV.8.6	And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water. 
LEV.8.7	And he put on him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and girded him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod, binding it to him therewith. 
LEV.8.8	And he placed the breastpiece on him, and in the breastpiece he put the Urim and the Thummim. 
LEV.8.9	And he set the turban upon his head, and on the turban, in front, he set the golden plate, the holy crown, as the 
LEV.8.10	Then Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and consecrated them. 
LEV.8.11	And he sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the laver and its base, to consecrate them. 
LEV.8.12	And he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head, and anointed him, to consecrate him. 
LEV.8.13	And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and clothed them with coats, and girded them with girdles, and bound caps on them, as the 
LEV.8.14	Then he brought the bull of the sin offering; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bull of the sin offering. 
LEV.8.15	And Moses killed it, and took the blood, and with his finger put it on the horns of the altar round about, and purified the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar, and consecrated it, to make atonement for it. 
LEV.8.16	And he took all the fat that was on the entrails, and the appendage of the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and Moses burned them on the altar. 
LEV.8.17	But the bull, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung, he burned with fire outside the camp, as the 
LEV.8.18	Then he presented the ram of the burnt offering; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. 
LEV.8.19	And Moses killed it, and threw the blood upon the altar round about. 
LEV.8.20	And when the ram was cut into pieces, Moses burned the head and the pieces and the fat. 
LEV.8.21	And when the entrails and the legs were washed with water, Moses burned the whole ram on the altar, as a burnt offering, a pleasing odor, an offering by fire to the 
LEV.8.22	Then he presented the other ram, the ram of ordination; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. 
LEV.8.23	And Moses killed it, and took some of its blood and put it on the tip of Aaron's right ear and on the thumb of his right hand and on the great toe of his right foot. 
LEV.8.24	And Aaron's sons were brought, and Moses put some of the blood on the tips of their right ears and on the thumbs of their right hands and on the great toes of their right feet; and Moses threw the blood upon the altar round about. 
LEV.8.25	Then he took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was on the entrails, and the appendage of the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and the right thigh; 
LEV.8.26	and out of the basket of unleavened bread which was before the 
LEV.8.27	and he put all these in the hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons, and waved them as a wave offering before the 
LEV.8.28	Then Moses took them from their hands, and burned them on the altar with the burnt offering, as an ordination offering, a pleasing odor, an offering by fire to the 
LEV.8.29	And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before the 
LEV.8.30	Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron and his garments, and also upon his sons and his sons' garments; so he consecrated Aaron and his garments, and his sons and his sons' garments with him.
LEV.8.31	And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, “Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting, and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of ordination offerings, as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it’; 
LEV.8.32	and what remains of the flesh and the bread you shall burn with fire. 
LEV.8.33	And you shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed, for it will take seven days to ordain you. 
LEV.8.34	As has been done today, the 
LEV.8.35	At the door of the tent of meeting you shall remain day and night for seven days, performing what the 
LEV.8.36	And Aaron and his sons did all the things which the 
LEV.9.1	On the eighth day Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel; 
LEV.9.2	and he said to Aaron, “Take a bull calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, both without blemish, and offer them before the 
LEV.9.3	And say to the people of Israel, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both a year old without blemish, for a burnt offering, 
LEV.9.4	and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the 
LEV.9.5	And they brought what Moses commanded before the tent of meeting; and all the congregation drew near and stood before the 
LEV.9.6	And Moses said, “This is the thing which the 
LEV.9.7	Then Moses said to Aaron, “Draw near to the altar, and offer your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself and for the people; and bring the offering of the people, and make atonement for them; as the 
LEV.9.8	So Aaron drew near to the altar, and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself. 
LEV.9.9	And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar; 
LEV.9.10	but the fat and the kidneys and the appendage of the liver from the sin offering he burned upon the altar, as the 
LEV.9.11	The flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.
LEV.9.12	And he killed the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons delivered to him the blood, and he threw it on the altar round about. 
LEV.9.13	And they delivered the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head; and he burned them upon the altar. 
LEV.9.14	And he washed the entrails and the legs, and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar.
LEV.9.15	Then he presented the people's offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and killed it, and offered it for sin, like the first sin offering. 
LEV.9.16	And he presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance. 
LEV.9.17	And he presented the cereal offering, and filled his hand from it, and burned it upon the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning.
LEV.9.19	and the fat of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers the entrails, and the kidneys, and the appendage of the liver; 
LEV.9.20	and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burned the fat upon the altar, 
LEV.9.21	but the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before the 
LEV.9.22	Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings. 
LEV.9.23	And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting; and when they came out they blessed the people, and the glory of the 
LEV.9.24	And fire came forth from before the 
LEV.10.1	Now Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer, and put fire in it, and laid incense on it, and offered unholy fire before the 
LEV.10.2	And fire came forth from the presence of the 
LEV.10.3	Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the 
LEV.10.4	And Moses called Misha-el and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, “Draw near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.” 
LEV.10.5	So they drew near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said. 
LEV.10.6	And Moses said to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons, “Do not let the hair of your heads hang loose, and do not rend your clothes, lest you die, and lest wrath come upon all the congregation; but your brethren, the whole house of Israel, may bewail the burning which the 
LEV.10.7	And do not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, lest you die; for the anointing oil of the 
LEV.10.9	“Drink no wine nor strong drink, you nor your sons with you, when you go into the tent of meeting, lest you die; it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations. 
LEV.10.10	You are to distinguish between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean; 
LEV.10.11	and you are to teach the people of Israel all the statutes which the

LEV.10.14	 But the breast that is waved and the thigh that is offered you shall eat in any clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you; for they are given as your due and your sons' due, from the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the people of Israel. 
LEV.10.15	The thigh that is offered and the breast that is waved they shall bring with the offerings by fire of the fat, to wave for a wave offering before the 
LEV.10.16	Now Moses diligently inquired about the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it was burned! And he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left, saying, 
LEV.10.17	“Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, since it is a thing most holy and has been given to you that you may bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the 
LEV.10.18	Behold, its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary. You certainly ought to have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.” 
LEV.10.19	And Aaron said to Moses, “Behold, today they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the 
LEV.10.20	And when Moses heard that, he was content.

LEV.11.2	 “Say to the people of Israel, These are the living things which you may eat among all the beasts that are on the earth. 
LEV.11.3	Whatever parts the hoof and is cloven-footed and chews the cud, among the animals, you may eat. 
LEV.11.4	Nevertheless among those that chew the cud or part the hoof, you shall not eat these: The camel, because it chews the cud but does not part the hoof, is unclean to you. 
LEV.11.5	And the rock badger, because it chews the cud but does not part the hoof, is unclean to you. 
LEV.11.6	And the hare, because it chews the cud but does not part the hoof, is unclean to you. 
LEV.11.7	And the swine, because it parts the hoof and is cloven-footed but does not chew the cud, is unclean to you. 
LEV.11.8	Of their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch; they are unclean to you.
LEV.11.9	“These you may eat, of all that are in the waters. Everything in the waters that has fins and scales, whether in the seas or in the rivers, you may eat. 
LEV.11.10	But anything in the seas or the rivers that has not fins and scales, of the swarming creatures in the waters and of the living creatures that are in the waters, is an abomination to you. 
LEV.11.11	They shall remain an abomination to you; of their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall have in abomination. 
LEV.11.12	Everything in the waters that has not fins and scales is an abomination to you.
LEV.11.13	“And these you shall have in abomination among the birds, they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, the vulture, the osprey,

LEV.11.20	“All winged insects that go upon all fours are an abomination to you. 
LEV.11.21	Yet among the winged insects that go on all fours you may eat those which have legs above their feet, with which to leap on the earth. 
LEV.11.22	Of them you may eat: the locust according to its kind, the bald locust according to its kind, the cricket according to its kind, and the grasshopper according to its kind. 
LEV.11.23	But all other winged insects which have four feet are an abomination to you.
LEV.11.24	“And by these you shall become unclean; whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening, 
LEV.11.25	and whoever carries any part of their carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening. 
LEV.11.26	Every animal which parts the hoof but is not cloven-footed or does not chew the cud is unclean to you; every one who touches them shall be unclean. 
LEV.11.27	And all that go on their paws, among the animals that go on all fours, are unclean to you; whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening, 
LEV.11.28	and he who carries their carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening; they are unclean to you.
LEV.11.29	“And these are unclean to you among the swarming things that swarm upon the earth: the weasel, the mouse, the great lizard according to its kind, 
LEV.11.30	the gecko, the land crocodile, the lizard, the sand lizard, and the chameleon.

LEV.11.34	Any food in it which may be eaten, upon which water may come, shall be unclean; and all drink which may be drunk from every such vessel shall be unclean. 
LEV.11.35	And everything upon which any part of their carcass falls shall be unclean; whether oven or stove, it shall be broken in pieces; they are unclean, and shall be unclean to you. 
LEV.11.36	Nevertheless a spring or a cistern holding water shall be clean; but whatever touches their carcass shall be unclean. 
LEV.11.37	And if any part of their carcass falls upon any seed for sowing that is to be sown, it is clean; 
LEV.11.38	but if water is put on the seed and any part of their carcass falls on it, it is unclean to you.
LEV.11.39	“And if any animal of which you may eat dies, he who touches its carcass shall be unclean until the evening,

LEV.12.2	“Say to the people of Israel, If a woman conceives, and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as at the time of her menstruation, she shall be unclean. 
LEV.12.3	And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. 
LEV.12.4	Then she shall continue for thirty-three days in the blood of her purifying; she shall not touch any hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying are completed. 
LEV.12.5	But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her menstruation; and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying for sixty-six days.
LEV.12.6	“And when the days of her purifying are completed, whether for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the door of the tent of meeting a lamb a year old for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering, 
LEV.12.7	and he shall offer it before the 
LEV.12.8	And if she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.”
LEV.13.1	The 
LEV.13.2	“When a man has on the skin of his body a swelling or an eruption or a spot, and it turns into a leprous disease on the skin of his body, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests, 
LEV.13.3	and the priest shall examine the diseased spot on the skin of his body; and if the hair in the diseased spot has turned white and the disease appears to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is a leprous disease; when the priest has examined him he shall pronounce him unclean. 
LEV.13.4	But if the spot is white in the skin of his body, and appears no deeper than the skin, and the hair in it has not turned white, the priest shall shut up the diseased person for seven days; 
LEV.13.5	and the priest shall examine him on the seventh day, and if in his eyes the disease is checked and the disease has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days more; 
LEV.13.6	and the priest shall examine him again on the seventh day, and if the diseased spot is dim and the disease has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is only an eruption; and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. 
LEV.13.7	But if the eruption spreads in the skin, after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall appear again before the priest; 
LEV.13.8	and the priest shall make an examination, and if the eruption has spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is leprosy.
LEV.13.9	“When a man is afflicted with leprosy, he shall be brought to the priest; 
LEV.13.10	and the priest shall make an examination, and if there is a white swelling in the skin, which has turned the hair white, and there is quick raw flesh in the swelling, 
LEV.13.11	it is a chronic leprosy in the skin of his body, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; he shall not shut him up, for he is unclean. 
LEV.13.12	And if the leprosy breaks out in the skin, so that the leprosy covers all the skin of the diseased person from head to foot, so far as the priest can see, 
LEV.13.13	then the priest shall make an examination, and if the leprosy has covered all his body, he shall pronounce him clean of the disease; it has all turned white, and he is clean. 
LEV.13.14	But when raw flesh appears on him, he shall be unclean. 
LEV.13.15	And the priest shall examine the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean; raw flesh is unclean, for it is leprosy. 
LEV.13.16	But if the raw flesh turns again and is changed to white, then he shall come to the priest, 
LEV.13.17	and the priest shall examine him, and if the disease has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce the diseased person clean; he is clean.
LEV.13.18	“And when there is in the skin of one's body a boil that has healed, 
LEV.13.19	and in the place of the boil there comes a white swelling or a reddish-white spot, then it shall be shown to the priest; 
LEV.13.20	and the priest shall make an examination, and if it appears deeper than the skin and its hair has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is the disease of leprosy, it has broken out in the boil. 
LEV.13.21	But if the priest examines it, and the hair on it is not white and it is not deeper than the skin, but is dim, then the priest shall shut him up seven days; 
LEV.13.22	and if it spreads in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is diseased. 
LEV.13.23	But if the spot remains in one place and does not spread, it is the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
LEV.13.24	“Or, when the body has a burn on its skin and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a spot, reddish-white or white, 
LEV.13.25	the priest shall examine it, and if the hair in the spot has turned white and it appears deeper than the skin, then it is leprosy; it has broken out in the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a leprous disease. 
LEV.13.26	But if the priest examines it, and the hair in the spot is not white and it is no deeper than the skin, but is dim, the priest shall shut him up seven days, 
LEV.13.27	and the priest shall examine him the seventh day; if it is spreading in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a leprous disease. 
LEV.13.28	But if the spot remains in one place and does not spread in the skin, but is dim, it is a swelling from the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him clean; for it is the scar of the burn.
LEV.13.29	“When a man or woman has a disease on the head or the beard, 
LEV.13.30	the priest shall examine the disease; and if it appears deeper than the skin, and the hair in it is yellow and thin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an itch, a leprosy of the head or the beard. 
LEV.13.31	And if the priest examines the itching disease, and it appears no deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up the person with the itching disease for seven days, 
LEV.13.32	and on the seventh day the priest shall examine the disease; and if the itch has not spread, and there is in it no yellow hair, and the itch appears to be no deeper than the skin, 
LEV.13.33	then he shall shave himself, but the itch he shall not shave; and the priest shall shut up the person with the itching disease for seven days more; 
LEV.13.34	and on the seventh day the priest shall examine the itch, and if the itch has not spread in the skin and it appears to be no deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. 
LEV.13.35	But if the itch spreads in the skin after his cleansing, 
LEV.13.36	then the priest shall examine him, and if the itch has spread in the skin, the priest need not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean. 
LEV.13.37	But if in his eyes the itch is checked, and black hair has grown in it, the itch is healed, he is clean; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
LEV.13.38	“When a man or a woman has spots on the skin of the body, white spots, 
LEV.13.39	the priest shall make an examination, and if the spots on the skin of the body are of a dull white, it is tetter that has broken out in the skin; he is clean.
LEV.13.40	“If a man's hair has fallen from his head, he is bald but he is clean. 
LEV.13.41	And if a man's hair has fallen from his forehead and temples, he has baldness of the forehead but he is clean. 
LEV.13.42	But if there is on the bald head or the bald forehead a reddish-white diseased spot, it is leprosy breaking out on his bald head or his bald forehead. 
LEV.13.43	Then the priest shall examine him, and if the diseased swelling is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, like the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the body, 
LEV.13.44	he is a leprous man, he is unclean; the priest must pronounce him unclean; his disease is on his head.
LEV.13.45	“The leper who has the disease shall wear torn clothes and let the hair of his head hang loose, and he shall cover his upper lip and cry, ‘Unclean, unclean.’ 
LEV.13.46	He shall remain unclean as long as he has the disease; he is unclean; he shall dwell alone in a habitation outside the camp.
LEV.13.47	“When there is a leprous disease in a garment, whether a woolen or a linen garment, 
LEV.13.48	in warp or woof of linen or wool, or in a skin or in anything made of skin, 
LEV.13.49	if the disease shows greenish or reddish in the garment, whether in warp or woof or in skin or in anything made of skin, it is a leprous disease and shall be shown to the priest. 
LEV.13.50	And the priest shall examine the disease, and shut up that which has the disease for seven days; 
LEV.13.51	then he shall examine the disease on the seventh day. If the disease has spread in the garment, in warp or woof, or in the skin, whatever be the use of the skin, the disease is a malignant leprosy; it is unclean. 
LEV.13.52	And he shall burn the garment, whether diseased in warp or woof, woolen or linen, or anything of skin, for it is a malignant leprosy; it shall be burned in the fire.
LEV.13.53	“And if the priest examines, and the disease has not spread in the garment in warp or woof or in anything of skin, 
LEV.13.54	then the priest shall command that they wash the thing in which is the disease, and he shall shut it up seven days more; 
LEV.13.55	and the priest shall examine the diseased thing after it has been washed. And if the diseased spot has not changed color, though the disease has not spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire, whether the leprous spot is on the back or on the front.
LEV.13.56	“But if the priest examines, and the disease is dim after it is washed, he shall tear the spot out of the garment or the skin or the warp or woof; 
LEV.13.57	then if it appears again in the garment, in warp or woof, or in anything of skin, it is spreading; you shall burn with fire that in which is the disease. 
LEV.13.58	But the garment, warp or woof, or anything of skin from which the disease departs when you have washed it, shall then be washed a second time, and be clean.”
LEV.13.59	This is the law for a leprous disease in a garment of wool or linen, either in warp or woof, or in anything of skin, to decide whether it is clean or unclean.
LEV.14.1	The 
LEV.14.2	 “This shall be the law of the leper for the day of his cleansing. He shall be brought to the priest; 
LEV.14.3	and the priest shall go out of the camp, and the priest shall make an examination. Then, if the leprous disease is healed in the leper, 
LEV.14.4	the priest shall command them to take for him who is to be cleansed two living clean birds and cedarwood and scarlet stuff and hyssop; 
LEV.14.5	and the priest shall command them to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water. 
LEV.14.6	He shall take the living bird with the cedarwood and the scarlet stuff and the hyssop, and dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water; 
LEV.14.7	and he shall sprinkle it seven times upon him who is to be cleansed of leprosy; then he shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird go into the open field. 
LEV.14.8	And he who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and bathe himself in water, and he shall be clean; and after that he shall come into the camp, but shall dwell outside his tent seven days. 
LEV.14.9	And on the seventh day he shall shave all his hair off his head; he shall shave off his beard and his eyebrows, all his hair. Then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe his body in water, and he shall be clean.
LEV.14.10	“And on the eighth day he shall take two male lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish, and a cereal offering of three tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, and one log of oil. 
LEV.14.11	And the priest who cleanses him shall set the man who is to be cleansed and these things before the 
LEV.14.12	And the priest shall take one of the male lambs, and offer it for a guilt offering, along with the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the 
LEV.14.13	and he shall kill the lamb in the place where they kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place; for the guilt offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the priest; it is most holy. 
LEV.14.14	The priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering, and the priest shall put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot. 
LEV.14.15	Then the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand, 
LEV.14.16	and dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and sprinkle some oil with his finger seven times before the 
LEV.14.17	And some of the oil that remains in his hand the priest shall put on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the guilt offering; 
LEV.14.18	and the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed. Then the priest shall make atonement for him before the 
LEV.14.19	The priest shall offer the sin offering, to make atonement for him who is to be cleansed from his uncleanness. And afterward he shall kill the burnt offering; 
LEV.14.20	and the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the cereal offering on the altar. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean.
LEV.14.21	“But if he is poor and cannot afford so much, then he shall take one male lamb for a guilt offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, and a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a cereal offering, and a log of oil; 
LEV.14.22	also two turtledoves or two young pigeons, such as he can afford; the one shall be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering. 
LEV.14.23	And on the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting, before the 
LEV.14.24	and the priest shall take the lamb of the guilt offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the 
LEV.14.25	And he shall kill the lamb of the guilt offering; and the priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering, and put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot. 
LEV.14.26	And the priest shall pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand; 
LEV.14.27	and shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the 
LEV.14.28	and the priest shall put some of the oil that is in his hand on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot, in the place where the blood of the guilt offering was put; 
LEV.14.29	and the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before the 
LEV.14.30	And he shall offer, of the turtledoves or young pigeons such as he can afford, 
LEV.14.31	one
LEV.14.32	This is the law for him in whom is a leprous disease, who cannot afford the offerings for his cleansing.”
LEV.14.33	The 
LEV.14.34	“When you come into the land of Canaan, which I give you for a possession, and I put a leprous disease in a house in the land of your possession, 
LEV.14.35	then he who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, ‘There seems to me to be some sort of disease in my house.’ 
LEV.14.36	Then the priest shall command that they empty the house before the priest goes to examine the disease, lest all that is in the house be declared unclean; and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house. 
LEV.14.37	And he shall examine the disease; and if the disease is in the walls of the house with greenish or reddish spots, and if it appears to be deeper than the surface, 
LEV.14.38	then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days. 
LEV.14.39	And the priest shall come again on the seventh day, and look; and if the disease has spread in the walls of the house, 
LEV.14.40	then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which is the disease and throw them into an unclean place outside the city; 
LEV.14.41	and he shall cause the inside of the house to be scraped round about, and the plaster that they scrape off they shall pour into an unclean place outside the city; 
LEV.14.42	then they shall take other stones and put them in the place of those stones, and he shall take other plaster and plaster the house.
LEV.14.43	“If the disease breaks out again in the house, after he has taken out the stones and scraped the house and plastered it, 
LEV.14.44	then the priest shall go and look; and if the disease has spread in the house, it is a malignant leprosy in the house; it is unclean. 
LEV.14.45	And he shall break down the house, its stones and timber and all the plaster of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city to an unclean place. 
LEV.14.46	Moreover he who enters the house while it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening; 
LEV.14.47	and he who lies down in the house shall wash his clothes; and he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes.
LEV.14.48	“But if the priest comes and makes an examination, and the disease has not spread in the house after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, for the disease is healed. 
LEV.14.49	And for the cleansing of the house he shall take two small birds, with cedarwood and scarlet stuff and hyssop, 
LEV.14.50	and shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water, 
LEV.14.51	and shall take the cedarwood and the hyssop and the scarlet stuff, along with the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the bird that was killed and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times. 
LEV.14.52	Thus he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedarwood and hyssop and scarlet stuff; 
LEV.14.53	and he shall let the living bird go out of the city into the open field; so he shall make atonement for the house, and it shall be clean.”
LEV.14.54	This is the law for any leprous disease: for an itch, 
LEV.14.55	for leprosy in a garment or in a house, 
LEV.14.56	and for a swelling or an eruption or a spot, 
LEV.14.57	to show when it is unclean and when it is clean. This is the law for leprosy.
LEV.15.1	The 
LEV.15.2	“Say to the people of Israel, When any man has a discharge from his body, his discharge is unclean. 
LEV.15.3	And this is the law of his uncleanness for a discharge: whether his body runs with his discharge, or his body is stopped from discharge, it is uncleanness in him. 
LEV.15.4	Every bed on which he who has the discharge lies shall be unclean; and everything on which he sits shall be unclean. 
LEV.15.5	And any one who touches his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

LEV.15.7	And whoever touches the body of him who has the discharge shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening. 
LEV.15.8	And if he who has the discharge spits on one who is clean, then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening. 
LEV.15.9	And any saddle on which he who has the discharge rides shall be unclean. 
LEV.15.10	And whoever touches anything that was under him shall be unclean until the evening; and he who carries such a thing shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening. 
LEV.15.11	Any one whom he that has the discharge touches without having rinsed his hands in water shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening. 
LEV.15.12	And the earthen vessel which he who has the discharge touches shall be broken; and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.
LEV.15.13	“And when he who has a discharge is cleansed of his discharge, then he shall count for himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes; and he shall bathe his body in running water, and shall be clean. 
LEV.15.14	And on the eighth day he shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and come before the 
LEV.15.15	and the priest shall offer them, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him before the 
LEV.15.16	“And if a man has an emission of semen, he shall bathe his whole body in water, and be unclean until the evening. 
LEV.15.17	And every garment and every skin on which the semen comes shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the evening. 
LEV.15.18	If a man lies with a woman and has an emission of semen, both of them shall bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the evening.
LEV.15.19	“When a woman has a discharge of blood which is her regular discharge from her body, she shall be in her impurity for seven days, and whoever touches her shall be unclean until the evening. 
LEV.15.20	And everything upon which she lies during her impurity shall be unclean; everything also upon which she sits shall be unclean. 
LEV.15.21	And whoever touches her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening. 
LEV.15.22	And whoever touches anything upon which she sits shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening; 
LEV.15.23	whether it is the bed or anything upon which she sits, when he touches it he shall be unclean until the evening. 
LEV.15.24	 And if any man lies with her, and her impurity is on him, he shall be unclean seven days; and every bed on which he lies shall be unclean.
LEV.15.25	“If a woman has a discharge of blood for many days, not at the time of her impurity, or if she has a discharge beyond the time of her impurity, all the days of the discharge she shall continue in uncleanness; as in the days of her impurity, she shall be unclean. 
LEV.15.26	Every bed on which she lies, all the days of her discharge, shall be to her as the bed of her impurity; and everything on which she sits shall be unclean, as in the uncleanness of her impurity. 
LEV.15.27	And whoever touches these things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening. 
LEV.15.28	But if she is cleansed of her discharge, she shall count for herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean. 
LEV.15.29	And on the eighth day she shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and bring them to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting. 
LEV.15.30	And the priest shall offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her before the 
LEV.15.31	“Thus you shall keep the people of Israel separate from their uncleanness, lest they die in their uncleanness by defiling my tabernacle that is in their midst.”
LEV.15.32	This is the law for him who has a discharge and for him who has an emission of semen, becoming unclean thereby; 
LEV.15.33	also for her who is sick with her impurity; that is, for any one, male or female, who has a discharge, and for the man who lies with a woman who is unclean.
LEV.16.1	The 
LEV.16.2	 and the 
LEV.16.3	But thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering. 
LEV.16.4	He shall put on the holy linen coat, and shall have the linen breeches on his body, be girded with the linen girdle, and wear the linen turban; these are the holy garments. He shall bathe his body in water, and then put them on. 
LEV.16.5	And he shall take from the congregation of the people of Israel two male goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.
LEV.16.6	“And Aaron shall offer the bull as a sin offering for himself, and shall make atonement for himself and for his house. 
LEV.16.7	Then he shall take the two goats, and set them before the 
LEV.16.8	and Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats, one lot for the 
LEV.16.9	And Aaron shall present the goat on which the lot fell for the 
LEV.16.10	but the goat on which the lot fell for Azazel shall be presented alive before the 
LEV.16.11	“Aaron shall present the bull as a sin offering for himself, and shall make atonement for himself and for his house; he shall kill the bull as a sin offering for himself. 
LEV.16.12	And he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from the altar before the 
LEV.16.13	and put the incense on the fire before the 
LEV.16.14	and he shall take some of the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it with his finger on the front of the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat he shall sprinkle the blood with his finger seven times.
LEV.16.15	“Then he shall kill the goat of the sin offering which is for the people, and bring its blood within the veil, and do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull, sprinkling it upon the mercy seat and before the mercy seat; 
LEV.16.16	thus he shall make atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleannesses of the people of Israel, and because of their transgressions, all their sins; and so he shall do for the tent of meeting, which abides with them in the midst of their uncleannesses. 
LEV.16.17	There shall be no man in the tent of meeting when he enters to make atonement in the holy place until he comes out and has made atonement for himself and for his house and for all the assembly of Israel. 
LEV.16.18	Then he shall go out to the altar which is before the 
LEV.16.19	And he shall sprinkle some of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the people of Israel.
LEV.16.20	“And when he has made an end of atoning for the holy place and the tent of meeting and the altar, he shall present the live goat; 
LEV.16.21	and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the people of Israel, and all their transgressions, all their sins; and he shall put them upon the head of the goat, and send him away into the wilderness by the hand of a man who is in readiness. 
LEV.16.22	The goat shall bear all their iniquities upon him to a solitary land; and he shall let the goat go in the wilderness.
LEV.16.23	“Then Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting, and shall put off the linen garments which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there; 
LEV.16.24	and he shall bathe his body in water in a holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people, and make atonement for himself and for the people. 
LEV.16.25	And the fat of the sin offering he shall burn upon the altar. 
LEV.16.26	And he who lets the goat go to Azazel shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp. 
LEV.16.27	 And the bull for the sin offering and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall be carried forth outside the camp; their skin and their flesh and their dung shall be burned with fire. 
LEV.16.28	And he who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp.
LEV.16.29	“And it shall be a statute to you for ever that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict yourselves, and shall do no work, either the native or the stranger who sojourns among you; 
LEV.16.30	for on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins you shall be clean before the 
LEV.16.31	It is a sabbath of solemn rest to you, and you shall afflict yourselves; it is a statute for ever. 
LEV.16.32	And the priest who is anointed and consecrated as priest in his father's place shall make atonement, wearing the holy linen garments; 
LEV.16.33	he shall make atonement for the sanctuary, and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar, and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly. 
LEV.16.34	And this shall be an everlasting statute for you, that atonement may be made for the people of Israel once in the year because of all their sins.” And Moses did as the 
LEV.17.1	And the 
LEV.17.2	“Say to Aaron and his sons, and to all the people of Israel, This is the thing which the 
LEV.17.3	If any man of the house of Israel kills an ox or a lamb or a goat in the camp, or kills it outside the camp, 
LEV.17.4	and does not bring it to the door of the tent of meeting, to offer it as a gift to the 
LEV.17.5	This is to the end that the people of Israel may bring their sacrifices which they slay in the open field, that they may bring them to the 
LEV.17.6	and the priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of the 
LEV.17.7	So they shall no more slay their sacrifices for satyrs, after whom they play the harlot. This shall be a statute for ever to them throughout their generations.
LEV.17.8	“And you shall say to them, Any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice, 
LEV.17.9	and does not bring it to the door of the tent of meeting, to sacrifice it to the 
LEV.17.11	For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it for you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that makes atonement, by reason of the life. 
LEV.17.12	Therefore I have said to the people of Israel, No person among you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger who sojourns among you eat blood. 
LEV.17.13	Any man also of the people of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, who takes in hunting any beast or bird that may be eaten shall pour out its blood and cover it with dust.
LEV.17.14	“For the life of every creature is the blood of it;
LEV.17.15	And every person that eats what dies of itself or what is torn by beasts, whether he is a native or a sojourner, shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening; then he shall be clean. 
LEV.17.16	But if he does not wash them or bathe his flesh, he shall bear his iniquity.”
LEV.18.1	And the 
LEV.18.2	“Say to the people of Israel, I am the 
LEV.18.3	You shall not do as they do in the land of Egypt, where you dwelt, and you shall not do as they do in the land of Canaan, to which I am bringing you. You shall not walk in their statutes. 
LEV.18.4	You shall do my ordinances and keep my statutes and walk in them. I am the 
LEV.18.5	 You shall therefore keep my statutes and my ordinances, by doing which a man shall live: I am the 
LEV.18.6	“None of you shall approach any one near of kin to him to uncover nakedness. I am the 
LEV.18.7	 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father, which is the nakedness of your mother; she is your mother, you shall not uncover her nakedness. 
LEV.18.8	You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's wife; it is your father's nakedness. 
LEV.18.9	 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father or the daughter of your mother, whether born at home or born abroad. 
LEV.18.10	You shall not uncover the nakedness of your son's daughter or of your daughter's daughter, for their nakedness is your own nakedness. 
LEV.18.11	You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's wife's daughter, begotten by your father, since she is your sister. 
LEV.18.12	 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's sister; she is your father's near kinswoman. 
LEV.18.13	You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister, for she is your mother's near kinswoman. 
LEV.18.14	 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's brother, that is, you shall not approach his wife; she is your aunt. 
LEV.18.15	 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law; she is your son's wife, you shall not uncover her nakedness. 
LEV.18.16	 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother's wife; she is your brother's nakedness. 
LEV.18.17	 You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and of her daughter, and you shall not take her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter to uncover her nakedness; they are your
LEV.18.18	And you shall not take a woman as a rival wife to her sister, uncovering her nakedness while her sister is yet alive.
LEV.18.20	And you shall not lie carnally with your neighbor's wife, and defile yourself with her. 
LEV.18.21	 You shall not give any of your children to devote them by fire to Molech, and so profane the name of your God: I am the 
LEV.18.22	 You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination. 
LEV.18.23	 And you shall not lie with any beast and defile yourself with it, neither shall any woman give herself to a beast to lie with it: it is perversion.
LEV.18.24	“Do not defile yourselves by any of these things, for by all these the nations I am casting out before you defiled themselves; 
LEV.18.25	and the land became defiled, so that I punished its iniquity, and the land vomited out its inhabitants. 
LEV.18.26	But you shall keep my statutes and my ordinances and do none of these abominations, either the native or the stranger who sojourns among you 
LEV.18.27	(for all of these abominations the men of the land did, who were before you, so that the land became defiled); 
LEV.18.28	lest the land vomit you out, when you defile it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you. 
LEV.18.29	For whoever shall do any of these abominations, the persons that do them shall be cut off from among their people. 
LEV.18.30	So keep my charge never to practice any of these abominable customs which were practiced before you, and never to defile yourselves by them: I am the 
LEV.19.1	And the 
LEV.19.2	 “Say to all the congregation of the people of Israel, You shall be holy; for I the 
LEV.19.3	 Every one of you shall revere his mother and his father, and you shall keep my sabbaths: I am the 
LEV.19.4	 Do not turn to idols or make for yourselves molten gods: I am the 
LEV.19.5	“When you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings to the 
LEV.19.6	It shall be eaten the same day you offer it, or on the morrow; and anything left over until the third day shall be burned with fire. 
LEV.19.7	If it is eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination; it will not be accepted, 
LEV.19.8	and every one who eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned a holy thing of the 
LEV.19.10	And you shall not strip your vineyard bare, neither shall you gather the fallen grapes of your vineyard; you shall leave them for the poor and for the sojourner: I am the 
LEV.19.12	 And you shall not swear by my name falsely, and so profane the name of your God: I am the 
LEV.19.14	 You shall not curse the deaf or put a stumbling block before the blind, but you shall fear your God: I am the 
LEV.19.16	You shall not go up and down as a slanderer among your people, and you shall not stand forth against the life

LEV.19.18	 You shall not take vengeance or bear any grudge against the sons of your own people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the 
LEV.19.20	“If a man lies carnally with a woman who is a slave, betrothed to another man and not yet ransomed or given her freedom, an inquiry shall be held. They shall not be put to death, because she was not free; 
LEV.19.21	but he shall bring a guilt offering for himself to the 
LEV.19.22	And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering before the 
LEV.19.23	“When you come into the land and plant all kinds of trees for food, then you shall count their fruit as forbidden;
LEV.19.24	And in the fourth year all their fruit shall be holy, an offering of praise to the 
LEV.19.25	But in the fifth year you may eat of their fruit, that they may yield more richly for you: I am the 
LEV.19.27	 You shall not round off the hair on you temples or mar the edges of your beard. 
LEV.19.28	You shall not make any cuttings in your flesh on account of the dead or tattoo any marks upon you: I am the 
LEV.19.30	 You shall keep my sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary: I am the 
LEV.19.32	“You shall rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of an old man, and you shall fear your God: I am the 
LEV.19.34	The stranger who sojourns with you shall be to you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself; for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the 
LEV.19.35	“You shall do no wrong in judgment, in measures of length or weight or quantity. 
LEV.19.36	You shall have just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin: I am the 
LEV.19.37	And you shall observe all my statutes and all my ordinances, and do them: I am the 
LEV.20.1	The 
LEV.20.2	 “Say to the people of Israel, Any man of the people of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, who gives any of his children to Molech shall be put to death; the people of the land shall stone him with stones. 
LEV.20.3	I myself will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people, because he has given one of his children to Molech, defiling my sanctuary and profaning my holy name. 
LEV.20.4	And if the people of the land do at all hide their eyes from that man, when he gives one of his children to Molech, and do not put him to death, 
LEV.20.5	then I will set my face against that man and against his family, and will cut them off from among their people, him and all who follow him in playing the harlot after Molech.
LEV.20.7	 Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy; for I am the 
LEV.20.8	Keep my statutes, and do them; I am the 
LEV.20.9	 For every one who curses his father or his mother shall be put to death; he has cursed his father or his mother, his blood is upon him.
LEV.20.11	 The man who lies with his father's wife has uncovered his father's nakedness; both of them shall be put to death, their blood is upon them. 
LEV.20.12	 If a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall be put to death; they have committed incest, their blood is upon them. 
LEV.20.13	 If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon them. 
LEV.20.14	 If a man takes a wife and her mother also, it is wickedness; they shall be burned with fire, both he and they, that there may be no wickedness among you. 
LEV.20.15	 If a man lies with a beast, he shall be put to death; and you shall kill the beast. 
LEV.20.16	If a woman approaches any beast and lies with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon them.
LEV.20.18	 If a man lies with a woman having her sickness, and uncovers her nakedness, he has made naked her fountain, and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood; both of them shall be cut off from among their people. 
LEV.20.19	 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister or of your father's sister, for that is to make naked one's near kin; they shall bear their iniquity. 
LEV.20.20	 If a man lies with his uncle's wife, he has uncovered his uncle's nakedness; they shall bear their sin, they shall die childless. 
LEV.20.21	 If a man takes his brother's wife, it is impurity; he has uncovered his brother's nakedness, they shall be childless.
LEV.20.22	“You shall therefore keep all my statutes and all my ordinances, and do them; that the land where I am bringing you to dwell may not vomit you out. 
LEV.20.23	And you shall not walk in the customs of the nation which I am casting out before you; for they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them. 
LEV.20.24	But I have said to you, ‘You shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess, a land flowing with milk and honey.’ I am the 
LEV.20.25	You shall therefore make a distinction between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the unclean bird and the clean; you shall not make yourselves abominable by beast or by bird or by anything with which the ground teems, which I have set apart for you to hold unclean. 
LEV.20.26	 You shall be holy to me; for I the 
LEV.21.2	except for his nearest of kin, his mother, his father, his son, his daughter, his brother, 
LEV.21.3	or his virgin sister (who is near to him because she has had no husband; for her he may defile himself). 
LEV.21.4	He shall not defile himself as a husband among his people and so profane himself. 
LEV.21.5	 They shall not make tonsures upon their heads, nor shave off the edges of their beards, nor make any cuttings in their flesh. 
LEV.21.6	They shall be holy to their God, and not profane the name of their God; for they offer the offerings by fire to the 
LEV.21.7	They shall not marry a harlot or a woman who has been defiled; neither shall they marry a woman divorced from her husband; for the priest is holy to his God. 
LEV.21.8	You shall consecrate him, for he offers the bread of your God; he shall be holy to you; for I the 
LEV.21.9	And the daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by playing the harlot, profanes her father; she shall be burned with fire.
LEV.21.10	“The priest who is chief among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and who has been consecrated to wear the garments, shall not let the hair of his head hang loose, nor rend his clothes; 
LEV.21.11	he shall not go in to any dead body, nor defile himself, even for his father or for his mother; 
LEV.21.12	neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the 
LEV.21.13	And he shall take a wife in her virginity. 
LEV.21.14	A widow, or one divorced, or a woman who has been defiled, or a harlot, these he shall not marry; but he shall take to wife a virgin of his own people, 
LEV.21.15	that he may not profane his children among his people; for I am the 
LEV.21.16	And the 
LEV.21.17	“Say to Aaron, None of your descendants throughout their generations who has a blemish may approach to offer the bread of his God. 
LEV.21.18	For no one who has a blemish shall draw near, a man blind or lame, or one who has a mutilated face or a limb too long, 
LEV.21.19	or a man who has an injured foot or an injured hand, 
LEV.21.20	or a hunchback, or a dwarf, or a man with a defect in his sight or an itching disease or scabs or crushed testicles; 
LEV.21.21	no man of the descendants of Aaron the priest who has a blemish shall come near to offer the 
LEV.21.22	He may eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy and of the holy things, 
LEV.21.23	but he shall not come near the veil or approach the altar, because he has a blemish, that he may not profane my sanctuaries; for I am the 
LEV.21.24	So Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons and to all the people of Israel.
LEV.22.1	And the 
LEV.22.2	“Tell Aaron and his sons to keep away from the holy things of the people of Israel, which they dedicate to me, so that they may not profane my holy name: I am the 
LEV.22.3	Say to them, ‘If any one of all your descendants throughout your generations approaches the holy things, which the people of Israel dedicate to the 
LEV.22.4	None of the line of Aaron who is a leper or suffers a discharge may eat of the holy things until he is clean. Whoever touches anything that is unclean through contact with the dead or a man who has had an emission of semen, 
LEV.22.5	and whoever touches a creeping thing by which he may be made unclean or a man from whom he may take uncleanness, whatever his uncleanness may be— 
LEV.22.6	the person who touches any such shall be unclean until the evening and shall not eat of the holy things unless he has bathed his body in water. 
LEV.22.7	When the sun is down he shall be clean; and afterward he may eat of the holy things, because such are his food. 
LEV.22.8	That which dies of itself or is torn by beasts he shall not eat, defiling himself by it: I am the 
LEV.22.9	They shall therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it and die thereby when they profane it: I am the 
LEV.22.10	“An outsider shall not eat of a holy thing. A sojourner of the priest's or a hired servant shall not eat of a holy thing; 
LEV.22.11	but if a priest buys a slave as his property for money, the slave may eat of it; and those that are born in his house may eat of his food. 
LEV.22.12	 If a priest's daughter is married to an outsider she shall not eat of the offering of the holy things. 
LEV.22.13	But if a priest's daughter is a widow or divorced, and has no child, and returns to her father's house, as in her youth, she may eat of her father's food; yet no outsider shall eat of it. 
LEV.22.14	And if a man eats of a holy thing unwittingly, he shall add the fifth of its value to it, and give the holy thing to the priest. 
LEV.22.15	The priests shall not profane the holy things of the people of Israel, which they offer to the 
LEV.22.16	and so cause them to bear iniquity and guilt, by eating their holy things: for I am the 
LEV.22.17	And the 
LEV.22.18	“Say to Aaron and his sons and all the people of Israel, When any one of the house of Israel or of the sojourners in Israel presents his offering, whether in payment of a vow or as a freewill offering which is offered to the 
LEV.22.19	to be accepted you shall offer a male without blemish, of the bulls or the sheep or the goats. 
LEV.22.20	You shall not offer anything that has a blemish, for it will not be acceptable for you. 
LEV.22.21	And when any one offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to the 
LEV.22.22	Animals blind or disabled or mutilated or having a discharge or an itch or scabs, you shall not offer to the 
LEV.22.23	A bull or a lamb which has a part too long or too short you may present for a freewill offering; but for a votive offering it cannot be accepted. 
LEV.22.24	Any animal which has its testicles bruised or crushed or torn or cut, you shall not offer to the 
LEV.22.25	neither shall you offer as the bread of your God any such animals gotten from a foreigner. Since there is a blemish in them, because of their mutilation, they will not be accepted for you.”
LEV.22.26	And the 
LEV.22.27	“When a bull or sheep or goat is born, it shall remain seven days with its mother; and from the eighth day on it shall be acceptable as an offering by fire to the 
LEV.22.28	And whether the mother is a cow or a ewe, you shall not kill both her and her young in one day. 
LEV.22.29	And when you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the 
LEV.22.30	It shall be eaten on the same day, you shall leave none of it until morning: I am the 
LEV.22.31	“So you shall keep my commandments and do them: I am the 
LEV.22.32	And you shall not profane my holy name, but I will be hallowed among the people of Israel; I am the 
LEV.22.33	who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I am the 
LEV.23.2	“Say to the people of Israel, The appointed feasts of the 
LEV.23.3	Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; you shall do no work; it is a sabbath to the 
LEV.23.4	“These are the appointed feasts of the 
LEV.23.5	In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening,
LEV.23.6	And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread to the 
LEV.23.7	On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work. 
LEV.23.8	But you shall present an offering by fire to the 
LEV.23.9	And the 
LEV.23.10	“Say to the people of Israel, When you come into the land which I give you and reap its harvest, you shall bring the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest; 
LEV.23.11	and he shall wave the sheaf before the 
LEV.23.12	And on the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb a year old without blemish as a burnt offering to the 
LEV.23.13	And the cereal offering with it shall be two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, to be offered by fire to the 
LEV.23.14	And you shall eat neither bread nor grain parched or fresh until this same day, until you have brought the offering of your God: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
LEV.23.15	“And you shall count from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven full weeks shall they be, 
LEV.23.16	counting fifty days to the morrow after the seventh sabbath; then you shall present a cereal offering of new grain to the 
LEV.23.17	You shall bring from your dwellings two loaves of bread to be waved, made of two tenths of an ephah; they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baked with leaven, as first fruits to the 
LEV.23.18	And you shall present with the bread seven lambs a year old without blemish, and one young bull, and two rams; they shall be a burnt offering to the 
LEV.23.19	And you shall offer one male goat for a sin offering, and two male lambs a year old as a sacrifice of peace offerings. 
LEV.23.20	And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits as a wave offering before the 
LEV.23.21	And you shall make proclamation on the same day; you shall hold a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work: it is a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
LEV.23.23	And the 
LEV.23.24	“Say to the people of Israel, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall observe a day of solemn rest, a memorial proclaimed with blast of trumpets, a holy convocation. 
LEV.23.25	You shall do no laborious work; and you shall present an offering by fire to the 
LEV.23.26	And the 
LEV.23.27	“On the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement; it shall be for you a time of holy convocation, and you shall afflict yourselves and present an offering by fire to the 
LEV.23.28	And you shall do no work on this same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before the 
LEV.23.29	For whoever is not afflicted on this same day shall be cut off from his people. 
LEV.23.30	And whoever does any work on this same day, that person I will destroy from among his people. 
LEV.23.31	You shall do no work: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 
LEV.23.32	It shall be to you a sabbath of solemn rest, and you shall afflict yourselves; on the ninth day of the month beginning at evening, from evening to evening shall you keep your sabbath.”
LEV.23.33	And the 
LEV.23.34	“Say to the people of Israel, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month and for seven days is the feast of booths
LEV.23.35	On the first day shall be a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work. 
LEV.23.36	Seven days you shall present offerings by fire to the 
LEV.23.37	“These are the appointed feasts of the 
LEV.23.38	besides the sabbaths of the 
LEV.23.39	“On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the produce of the land, you shall keep the feast of the 
LEV.23.40	And you shall take on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before the 
LEV.23.41	You shall keep it as a feast to the 
LEV.23.42	You shall dwell in booths for seven days; all that are native in Israel shall dwell in booths, 
LEV.23.43	that your generations may know that I made the people of Israel dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the 
LEV.23.44	Thus Moses declared to the people of Israel the appointed feasts of the 
LEV.24.2	“Command the people of Israel to bring you pure oil from beaten olives for the lamp, that a light may be kept burning continually. 
LEV.24.3	Outside the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, Aaron shall keep it in order from evening to morning before the 
LEV.24.4	He shall keep the lamps in order upon the lampstand of pure gold before the 
LEV.24.6	And you shall set them in two rows, six in a row, upon the table of pure gold. 
LEV.24.7	And you shall put pure frankincense with each row, that it may go with the bread as a memorial portion to be offered by fire to the 
LEV.24.8	Every sabbath day Aaron shall set it in order before the 
LEV.24.9	And it shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall eat it in a holy place, since it is for him a most holy portion out of the offerings by fire to the 
LEV.24.10	Now an Israelite woman's son, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the people of Israel; and the Israelite woman's son and a man of Israel quarreled in the camp, 
LEV.24.11	and the Israelite woman's son blasphemed the Name, and cursed. And they brought him to Moses. His mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan. 
LEV.24.12	And they put him in custody, till the will of the 
LEV.24.13	And the 
LEV.24.14	“Bring out of the camp him who cursed; and let all who heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him. 
LEV.24.15	And say to the people of Israel, Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin. 
LEV.24.16	He who blasphemes the name of the 
LEV.24.17	He who kills a man shall be put to death. 
LEV.24.18	He who kills a beast shall make it good, life for life. 
LEV.24.19	 When a man causes a disfigurement in his neighbor, as he has done it shall be done to him, 
LEV.24.20	fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he has disfigured a man, he shall be disfigured. 
LEV.24.21	He who kills a beast shall make it good; and he who kills a man shall be put to death. 
LEV.24.22	 You shall have one law for the sojourner and for the native; for I am the 
LEV.24.23	So Moses spoke to the people of Israel; and they brought him who had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. Thus the people of Israel did as the 
LEV.25.1	The 
LEV.25.2	 “Say to the people of Israel, When you come into the land which I give you, the land shall keep a sabbath to the 
LEV.25.3	Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard, and gather in its fruits; 
LEV.25.4	but in the seventh year there shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath to the 
LEV.25.5	What grows of itself in your harvest you shall not reap, and the grapes of your undressed vine you shall not gather; it shall be a year of solemn rest for the land. 
LEV.25.6	The sabbath of the land shall provide food for you, for yourself and for your male and female slaves and for your hired servant and the sojourner who lives with you; 
LEV.25.7	for your cattle also and for the beasts that are in your land all its yield shall be for food.
LEV.25.8	“And you shall count seven weeks
LEV.25.9	Then you shall send abroad the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the day of atonement you shall send abroad the trumpet throughout all your land. 
LEV.25.10	And you shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants; it shall be a jubilee for you, when each of you shall return to his property and each of you shall return to his family. 
LEV.25.11	A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be to you; in it you shall neither sow, nor reap what grows of itself, nor gather the grapes from the undressed vines. 
LEV.25.12	For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you; you shall eat what it yields out of the field.
LEV.25.13	“In this year of jubilee each of you shall return to his property. 
LEV.25.14	And if you sell to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor, you shall not wrong one another. 
LEV.25.15	According to the number of years after the jubilee, you shall buy from your neighbor, and according to the number of years for crops he shall sell to you. 
LEV.25.16	If the years are many you shall increase the price, and if the years are few you shall diminish the price, for it is the number of the crops that he is selling to you. 
LEV.25.17	You shall not wrong one another, but you shall fear your God; for I am the 
LEV.25.18	“Therefore you shall do my statutes, and keep my ordinances and perform them; so you will dwell in the land securely. 
LEV.25.19	The land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill, and dwell in it securely. 
LEV.25.20	And if you say, ‘What shall we eat in the seventh year, if we may not sow or gather in our crop?’ 
LEV.25.21	I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, so that it will bring forth fruit for three years. 
LEV.25.22	When you sow in the eighth year, you will be eating old produce; until the ninth year, when its produce comes in, you shall eat the old. 
LEV.25.23	The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine; for you are strangers and sojourners with me. 
LEV.25.24	And in all the country you possess, you shall grant a redemption of the land.
LEV.25.25	“If your brother becomes poor, and sells part of his property, then his next of kin shall come and redeem what his brother has sold. 
LEV.25.26	If a man has no one to redeem it, and then himself becomes prosperous and finds sufficient means to redeem it, 
LEV.25.27	let him reckon the years since he sold it and pay back the overpayment to the man to whom he sold it; and he shall return to his property. 
LEV.25.28	But if he has not sufficient means to get it back for himself, then what he sold shall remain in the hand of him who bought it until the year of jubilee; in the jubilee it shall be released, and he shall return to his property.
LEV.25.29	“If a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, he may redeem it within a whole year after its sale; for a full year he shall have the right of redemption. 
LEV.25.30	If it is not redeemed within a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him who bought it, throughout his generations; it shall not be released in the jubilee. 
LEV.25.31	But the houses of the villages which have no wall around them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country; they may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the jubilee. 
LEV.25.32	Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses in the cities of their possession, the Levites may redeem at any time. 
LEV.25.33	And if one of the Levites does not exercise
LEV.25.34	But the fields of common land belonging to their cities may not be sold; for that is their perpetual possession.
LEV.25.36	 Take no interest from him or increase, but fear your God; that your brother may live beside you. 
LEV.25.37	You shall not lend him your money at interest, nor give him your food for profit. 
LEV.25.38	I am the 
LEV.25.40	he shall be with you as a hired servant and as a sojourner. He shall serve with you until the year of the jubilee; 
LEV.25.41	then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, and go back to his own family, and return to the possession of his fathers. 
LEV.25.42	For they are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as slaves. 
LEV.25.43	You shall not rule over him with harshness, but shall fear your God. 
LEV.25.44	As for your male and female slaves whom you may have: you may buy male and female slaves from among the nations that are round about you. 
LEV.25.45	You may also buy from among the strangers who sojourn with you and their families that are with you, who have been born in your land; and they may be your property. 
LEV.25.46	You may bequeath them to your sons after you, to inherit as a possession for ever; you may make slaves of them, but over your brethren the people of Israel you shall not rule, one over another, with harshness.
LEV.25.47	“If a stranger or sojourner with you becomes rich, and your brother beside him becomes poor and sells himself to the stranger or sojourner with you, or to a member of the stranger's family, 
LEV.25.48	then after he is sold he may be redeemed; one of his brothers may redeem him, 
LEV.25.49	or his uncle, or his cousin may redeem him, or a near kinsman belonging to his family may redeem him; or if he grows rich he may redeem himself. 
LEV.25.50	He shall reckon with him who bought him from the year when he sold himself to him until the year of jubilee, and the price of his release shall be according to the number of years; the time he was with his owner shall be rated as the time of a hired servant. 
LEV.25.51	If there are still many years, according to them he shall refund out of the price paid for him the price for his redemption. 
LEV.25.52	If there remain but a few years until the year of jubilee, he shall make a reckoning with him; according to the years of service due from him he shall refund the money for his redemption. 
LEV.25.53	As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him; he shall not rule with harshness over him in your sight. 
LEV.25.54	And if he is not redeemed by these means, then he shall be released in the year of jubilee, he and his children with him. 
LEV.25.55	For to me the people of Israel are servants, they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the 
LEV.26.2	 You shall keep my sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary: I am the 
LEV.26.4	then I will give you your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. 
LEV.26.5	And your threshing shall last to the time of vintage, and the vintage shall last to the time for sowing; and you shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land securely. 
LEV.26.6	And I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid; and I will remove evil beasts from the land, and the sword shall not go through your land. 
LEV.26.7	And you shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. 
LEV.26.8	Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. 
LEV.26.9	And I will have regard for you and make you fruitful and multiply you, and will confirm my covenant with you. 
LEV.26.10	And you shall eat old store long kept, and you shall clear out the old to make way for the new. 
LEV.26.11	 And I will make my abode among you, and my soul shall not abhor you. 
LEV.26.12	And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and you shall be my people. 
LEV.26.13	I am the 
LEV.26.15	if you spurn my statutes, and if your soul abhors my ordinances, so that you will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant, 
LEV.26.16	I will do this to you: I will appoint over you sudden terror, consumption and fever that waste the eyes and cause life to pine away. And you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it; 
LEV.26.17	I will set my face against you, and you shall be smitten before your enemies; those who hate you shall rule over you, and you shall flee when none pursues you. 
LEV.26.18	And if in spite of this you will not hearken to me, then I will chastise you again sevenfold for your sins, 
LEV.26.19	and I will break the pride of your power, and I will make your heavens like iron and your earth like brass; 
LEV.26.20	and your strength shall be spent in vain, for your land shall not yield its increase, and the trees of the land shall not yield their fruit.
LEV.26.21	“Then if you walk contrary to me, and will not hearken to me, I will bring more plagues upon you, sevenfold as many as your sins. 
LEV.26.22	And I will let loose the wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number, so that your ways shall become desolate.
LEV.26.23	“And if by this discipline you are not turned to me, but walk contrary to me, 
LEV.26.24	then I also will walk contrary to you, and I myself will smite you sevenfold for your sins. 
LEV.26.25	And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute vengeance for the covenant; and if you gather within your cities I will send pestilence among you, and you shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy. 
LEV.26.26	When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and shall deliver your bread again by weight; and you shall eat, and not be satisfied.
LEV.26.27	“And if in spite of this you will not hearken to me, but walk contrary to me, 
LEV.26.28	then I will walk contrary to you in fury, and chastise you myself sevenfold for your sins. 
LEV.26.29	You shall eat the flesh of your sons, and you shall eat the flesh of your daughters. 
LEV.26.30	And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your incense altars, and cast your dead bodies upon the dead bodies of your idols; and my soul will abhor you. 
LEV.26.31	And I will lay your cities waste, and will make your sanctuaries desolate, and I will not smell your pleasing odors. 
LEV.26.32	And I will devastate the land, so that your enemies who settle in it shall be astonished at it. 
LEV.26.33	And I will scatter you among the nations, and I will unsheathe the sword after you; and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.
LEV.26.34	“Then the land shall enjoy
LEV.26.35	As long as it lies desolate it shall have rest, the rest which it had not in your sabbaths when you dwelt upon it. 
LEV.26.36	And as for those of you that are left, I will send faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; the sound of a driven leaf shall put them to flight, and they shall flee as one flees from the sword, and they shall fall when none pursues. 
LEV.26.37	They shall stumble over one another, as if to escape a sword, though none pursues; and you shall have no power to stand before your enemies. 
LEV.26.38	And you shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up. 
LEV.26.39	And those of you that are left shall pine away in your enemies' lands because of their iniquity; and also because of the iniquities of their fathers they shall pine away like them.
LEV.26.41	so that I walked contrary to them and brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled and they make amends for their iniquity; 
LEV.26.42	then I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and I will remember my covenant with Isaac and my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land. 
LEV.26.43	But the land shall be left by them, and enjoy
LEV.26.44	Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not spurn them, neither will I abhor them so as to destroy them utterly and break my covenant with them; for I am the 
LEV.26.45	but I will for their sake remember the covenant with their forefathers, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am the 
LEV.26.46	These are the statutes and ordinances and laws which the 
LEV.27.1	The 
LEV.27.2	“Say to the people of Israel, When a man makes a special vow of persons to the 
LEV.27.3	then your valuation of a male from twenty years old up to sixty years old shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary. 
LEV.27.4	If the person is a female, your valuation shall be thirty shekels. 
LEV.27.5	If the person is from five years old up to twenty years old, your valuation shall be for a male twenty shekels, and for a female ten shekels. 
LEV.27.6	If the person is from a month old up to five years old, your valuation shall be for a male five shekels of silver, and for a female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver. 
LEV.27.7	And if the person is sixty years old and upward, then your valuation for a male shall be fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels. 
LEV.27.8	And if a man is too poor to pay your valuation, then he shall bring the person before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of him who vowed the priest shall value him.
LEV.27.9	“If it is an animal such as men offer as an offering to the 
LEV.27.10	He shall not substitute anything for it or exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if he makes any exchange of beast for beast, then both it and that for which it is exchanged shall be holy. 
LEV.27.11	And if it is an unclean animal such as is not offered as an offering to the 
LEV.27.12	and the priest shall value it as either good or bad; as you, the priest, value it, so it shall be. 
LEV.27.13	But if he wishes to redeem it, he shall add a fifth to the valuation.
LEV.27.14	“When a man dedicates his house to be holy to the 
LEV.27.15	And if he who dedicates it wishes to redeem his house, he shall add a fifth of the valuation in money to it, and it shall be his.
LEV.27.16	“If a man dedicates to the 
LEV.27.17	If he dedicates his field from the year of jubilee, it shall stand at your full valuation; 
LEV.27.18	but if he dedicates his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall compute the money-value for it according to the years that remain until the year of jubilee, and a deduction shall be made from your valuation. 
LEV.27.19	And if he who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it, then he shall add a fifth of the valuation in money to it, and it shall remain his. 
LEV.27.20	But if he does not wish to redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more; 
LEV.27.21	but the field, when it is released in the jubilee, shall be holy to the 
LEV.27.22	If he dedicates to the 
LEV.27.23	then the priest shall compute the valuation for it up to the year of jubilee, and the man shall give the amount of the valuation on that day as a holy thing to the 
LEV.27.24	In the year of jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought, to whom the land belongs as a possession by inheritance. 
LEV.27.25	Every valuation shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall make a shekel.
LEV.27.26	“But a firstling of animals, which as a firstling belongs to the 
LEV.27.27	And if it is an unclean animal, then he shall buy it back at your valuation, and add a fifth to it; or, if it is not redeemed, it shall be sold at your valuation.
LEV.27.29	No one devoted, who is to be utterly destroyed from among men, shall be ransomed; he shall be put to death.
LEV.27.30	“All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is the 
LEV.27.31	If a man wishes to redeem any of his tithe, he shall add a fifth to it. 
LEV.27.32	And all the tithe of herds and flocks, every tenth animal of all that pass under the herdsman's staff, shall be holy to the 
LEV.27.33	A man shall not inquire whether it is good or bad, neither shall he exchange it; and if he exchanges it, then both it and that for which it is exchanged shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.”
LEV.27.34	These are the commandments which the

NUM.2.32	These are the people of Israel as numbered by their fathers' houses; all in the camps who were numbered by their companies were six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty. 
NUM.2.33	But the Levites were not numbered among the people of Israel, as the

NUM.3.12	“Behold, I have taken the Levites from among the people of Israel instead of every first-born that opens the womb among the people of Israel. The Levites shall be mine,

NUM.3.14	And the 
NUM.3.15	 “Number the sons of Levi, by fathers' houses and by families; every male from a month old and upward you shall number.” 
NUM.3.16	So Moses numbered them according to the word of the

NUM.3.22	Their number according to the number of all the males from a month old and upward was
NUM.3.23	The families of the Gershonites were to encamp behind the tabernacle on the west, 
NUM.3.24	with Eliasaph, the son of Lael as head of the fathers' house of the Gershonites. 
NUM.3.25	And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting was to be the tabernacle, the tent with its covering, the screen for the door of the tent of meeting,

NUM.3.31	And their charge was to be the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the vessels of the sanctuary with which the priests minister, and the screen; all the service pertaining to these. 
NUM.3.32	And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest was to be chief over the leaders of the Levites, and to have oversight of those who had charge of the sanctuary.
NUM.3.33	Of Merari were the family of the Mahlites and the family of the Mushites: these are the families of Merari. 
NUM.3.34	Their number according to the number of all the males from a month old and upward was six thousand two hundred. 
NUM.3.35	And the head of the fathers' house of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail; they were to encamp on the north side of the tabernacle. 
NUM.3.36	And the appointed charge of the sons of Merari was to be the frames of the tabernacle, the bars, the pillars, the bases, and all their accessories; all the service pertaining to these; 
NUM.3.37	also the pillars of the court round about, with their bases and pegs and cords.
NUM.3.38	And those to encamp before the tabernacle on the east, before the tent of meeting toward the sunrise, were Moses and Aaron and his sons, having charge of the rites within the sanctuary, whatever had to be done for the people of Israel; and any one else who came near was to be put to death. 
NUM.3.39	All who were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the 
NUM.3.40	And the 
NUM.3.41	And you shall take the Levites for me—I am the

NUM.3.43	And all the first-born males, according to the number of names, from a month old and upward as numbered were twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy-three.
NUM.3.44	And the 
NUM.3.45	 “Take the Levites instead of all the first-born among the people of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am the 
NUM.3.46	And for the redemption of the two hundred and seventy-three of the first-born of the people of Israel, over and above the number of the male Levites, 
NUM.3.47	you shall take five shekels apiece; reckoning by the shekel of the sanctuary, the shekel of twenty gerahs, you shall take them, 
NUM.3.48	and give the money by which the excess number of them is redeemed to Aaron and his sons.” 
NUM.3.49	So Moses took the redemption money from those who were over and above those redeemed by the Levites; 
NUM.3.50	from the first-born of the people of Israel he took the money, one thousand three hundred and sixty-five shekels, reckoned by the shekel of the sanctuary; 
NUM.3.51	and Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons, according to the word of the 
NUM.4.2	“Take a census of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their families and their fathers' houses, 
NUM.4.3	from thirty years old up to fifty years old, all who can enter the service, to do the work in the tent of meeting. 
NUM.4.4	This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting: the most holy things. 
NUM.4.5	When the camp is to set out, Aaron and his sons shall go in and take down the veil of the screen, and cover the ark of the testimony with it; 
NUM.4.6	then they shall put on it a covering of goatskin, and spread over that a cloth all of blue, and shall put in its poles. 
NUM.4.7	And over the table of the bread of the Presence they shall spread a cloth of blue, and put upon it the plates, the dishes for incense, the bowls, and the flagons for the drink offering; the continual bread also shall be on it; 
NUM.4.8	then they shall spread over them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the same with a covering of goatskin, and shall put in its poles. 
NUM.4.9	And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the lampstand for the light, with its lamps, its snuffers, its trays, and all the vessels for oil with which it is supplied: 
NUM.4.10	and they shall put it with all its utensils in a covering of goatskin and put it upon the carrying frame. 
NUM.4.11	And over the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, and cover it with a covering of goatskin, and shall put in its poles; 
NUM.4.12	and they shall take all the vessels of the service which are used in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of blue, and cover them with a covering of goatskin, and put them on the carrying frame. 
NUM.4.13	And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth over it; 
NUM.4.14	and they shall put on it all the utensils of the altar, which are used for the service there, the firepans, the forks, the shovels, and the basins, all the utensils of the altar; and they shall spread upon it a covering of goatskin, and shall put in its poles. 
NUM.4.15	And when Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all the furnishings of the sanctuary, as the camp sets out, after that the sons of Kohath shall come to carry these, but they must not touch the holy things, lest they die. These are the things of the tent of meeting which the sons of Kohath are to carry.
NUM.4.16	“And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall have charge of the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the continual cereal offering, and the anointing oil, with the oversight of all the tabernacle and all that is in it, of the sanctuary and its vessels.”

NUM.4.18	“Let not the tribe of the families of the Kohathites be destroyed from among the Levites; 
NUM.4.19	but deal thus with them, that they may live and not die when they come near to the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in and appoint them each to his task and to his burden, 
NUM.4.20	but they shall not go in to look upon the holy things even for a moment, lest they die.”
NUM.4.21	The 
NUM.4.22	“Take a census of the sons of Gershon also, by their families and their fathers' houses; 
NUM.4.23	from thirty years old up to fifty years old, you shall number them, all who can enter for service, to do the work in the tent of meeting. 
NUM.4.24	This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, in serving and bearing burdens:

NUM.5.15	then the man shall bring his wife to the priest, and bring the offering required of her, a tenth of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it and put no frankincense on it, for it is a cereal offering of jealousy, a cereal offering of remembrance, bringing iniquity to remembrance.
NUM.5.16	“And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the 
NUM.5.17	and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel, and take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put it into the water.

NUM.5.25	And the priest shall take the cereal offering of jealousy out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the cereal offering before the 
NUM.5.26	and the priest shall take a handful of the cereal offering, as its memorial portion, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall make the woman drink the water. 
NUM.5.27	And when he has made her drink the water, then, if she has defiled herself and has acted unfaithfully against her husband, the water that brings the curse shall enter into her and cause bitter pain, and her body shall swell, and her thigh shall fall away, and the woman shall become an execration among her people. 
NUM.5.28	But if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, then she shall be free and shall conceive children.

NUM.7.89	And when Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with the 
NUM.8.1	Now the 
NUM.8.2	“Say to Aaron, When you set up the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand.” 
NUM.8.3	And Aaron did so; he set up its lamps to give light in front of the lampstand, as the 
NUM.8.4	And this was the workmanship of the lampstand, hammered work of gold; from its base to its flowers, it was hammered work; according to the pattern which the 
NUM.8.5	And the 
NUM.8.6	 “Take the Levites from among the people of Israel, and cleanse them. 
NUM.8.7	And thus you shall do to them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of expiation upon them, and let them go with a razor over all their body, and wash their clothes and cleanse themselves. 
NUM.8.8	Then let them take a young bull and its cereal offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you shall take another young bull for a sin offering. 
NUM.8.9	And you shall present the Levites before the tent of meeting, and assemble the whole congregation of the people of Israel. 
NUM.8.10	When you present the Levites before the 
NUM.8.11	and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the 
NUM.8.12	Then the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bulls; and you shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to the 
NUM.8.13	And you shall cause the Levites to attend Aaron and his sons, and shall offer them as a wave offering to the 
NUM.8.14	“Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the people of Israel, and the Levites shall be mine. 
NUM.8.15	And after that the Levites shall go in to do service at the tent of meeting, when you have cleansed them and offered them as a wave offering. 
NUM.8.16	For they are wholly given to me from among the people of Israel; instead of all that open the womb, the first-born of all the people of Israel, I have taken them for myself. 
NUM.8.17	For all the first-born among the people of Israel are mine, both of man and of beast; on the day that I slew all the first-born in the land of Egypt I consecrated them for myself, 
NUM.8.18	 and I have taken the Levites instead of all the first-born among the people of Israel. 
NUM.8.19	And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the people of Israel, to do the service for the people of Israel at the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the people of Israel, that there may be no plague among the people of Israel in case the people of Israel should come near the sanctuary.”
NUM.8.20	Thus did Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the people of Israel to the Levites; according to all that the 
NUM.8.21	And the Levites purified themselves from sin, and washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them as a wave offering before the 
NUM.8.22	And after that the Levites went in to do their service in the tent of meeting in attendance upon Aaron and his sons; as the 
NUM.8.23	And the 
NUM.8.24	“This is what pertains to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall go in to perform the work in the service of the tent of meeting; 
NUM.8.25	and from the age of fifty years they shall withdraw from the work of the service and serve no more, 
NUM.8.26	but minister to their brethren in the tent of meeting, to keep the charge, and they shall do no service. Thus shall you do to the Levites in assigning their duties.”
NUM.9.2	“Let the people of Israel keep the passover at its appointed time. 
NUM.9.3	On the fourteenth day of this month, in the evening, you shall keep it at its appointed time; according to all its statutes and all its ordinances you shall keep it.” 
NUM.9.4	So Moses told the people of Israel that they should keep the passover. 
NUM.9.5	And they kept the passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the 
NUM.9.6	And there were certain men who were unclean through touching the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the passover on that day; and they came before Moses and Aaron on that day; 
NUM.9.7	and those men said to him, “We are unclean through touching the dead body of a man; why are we kept from offering the 
NUM.9.8	And Moses said to them, “Wait, that I may hear what the 
NUM.9.9	The 
NUM.9.10	“Say to the people of Israel, If any man of you or of your descendants is unclean through touching a dead body, or is afar off on a journey, he shall still keep the passover to the 
NUM.9.11	In the second month on the fourteenth day in the evening they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. 
NUM.9.12	 They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break a bone of it; according to all the statute for the passover they shall keep it. 
NUM.9.13	But the man who is clean and is not on a journey, yet refrains from keeping the passover, that person shall be cut off from his people, because he did not offer the 
NUM.9.14	And if a stranger sojourns among you, and will keep the passover to the 
NUM.9.16	So it was continually; the cloud covered it by day,
NUM.9.17	And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tent, after that the people of Israel set out; and in the place where the cloud settled down, there the people of Israel encamped. 
NUM.9.18	At the command of the 
NUM.9.19	Even when the cloud continued over the tabernacle many days, the people of Israel kept the charge of the 
NUM.9.20	Sometimes the cloud was a few days over the tabernacle, and according to the command of the 
NUM.9.21	And sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they set out, or if it continued for a day and a night, when the cloud was taken up they set out. 
NUM.9.22	Whether it was two days, or a month, or a longer time, that the cloud continued over the tabernacle, abiding there, the people of Israel remained in camp and did not set out; but when it was taken up they set out. 
NUM.9.23	At the command of the 
NUM.10.1	The 
NUM.10.2	“Make two silver trumpets; of hammered work you shall make them; and you shall use them for summoning the congregation, and for breaking camp. 
NUM.10.3	And when both are blown, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the entrance of the tent of meeting. 
NUM.10.4	But if they blow only one, then the leaders, the heads of the tribes of Israel, shall gather themselves to you. 
NUM.10.5	When you blow an alarm, the camps that are on the east side shall set out. 
NUM.10.6	And when you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that are on the south side shall set out. An alarm is to be blown whenever they are to set out. 
NUM.10.7	But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm. 
NUM.10.8	And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets. The trumpets shall be to you for a perpetual statute throughout your generations. 
NUM.10.9	And when you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, that you may be remembered before the 
NUM.10.10	On the day of your gladness also, and at your appointed feasts, and at the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; they shall serve you for remembrance before your God: I am the 
NUM.10.11	In the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony, 
NUM.10.12	and the people of Israel set out by stages from the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud settled down in the wilderness of Paran. 
NUM.10.13	They set out for the first time at the command of the 
NUM.10.14	The standard of the camp of the men of Judah set out first by their companies; and over their host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab. 
NUM.10.15	And over the host of the tribe of the men of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar. 
NUM.10.16	And over the host of the tribe of the men of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.
NUM.10.17	And when the tabernacle was taken down, the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who carried the tabernacle, set out. 
NUM.10.18	And the standard of the camp of Reuben set out by their companies; and over their host was Elizur the son of Shedeur. 
NUM.10.19	And over the host of the tribe of the men of Simeon was Shelumi-el the son of Zurishaddai. 
NUM.10.20	And over the host of the tribe of the men of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.
NUM.10.21	Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy things, and the tabernacle was set up before their arrival. 
NUM.10.22	And the standard of the camp of the men of Ephraim set out by their companies; and over their host was Elishama the son of Ammihud. 
NUM.10.23	And over the host of the tribe of the men of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur. 
NUM.10.24	And over the host of the tribe of the men of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.
NUM.10.25	Then the standard of the camp of the men of Dan, acting as the rear guard of all the camps, set out by their companies; and over their host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai. 
NUM.10.26	And over the host of the tribe of the men of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ochran. 
NUM.10.27	And over the host of the tribe of the men of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan. 
NUM.10.28	This was the order of march of the people of Israel according to their hosts, when they set out.
NUM.10.29	And Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, “We are setting out for the place of which the 
NUM.10.30	But he said to him, “I will not go; I will depart to my own land and to my kindred.” 
NUM.10.31	And he said, “Do not leave us, I pray you, for you know how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and you will serve as eyes for us. 
NUM.10.32	And if you go with us, whatever good the 
NUM.10.33	So they set out from the mount of the 
NUM.10.34	And the cloud of the 
NUM.10.36	And when it rested, he said, “Return, O 
NUM.11.1	And the people complained in the hearing of the 
NUM.11.2	Then the people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to the 
NUM.11.3	So the name of that place was called Taberah,
NUM.11.5	We remember the fish we ate in Egypt for nothing, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic; 
NUM.11.6	but now our strength is dried up, and there is nothing at all but this manna to look at.”
NUM.11.7	Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like that of bdellium. 
NUM.11.8	The people went about and gathered it, and ground it in mills or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it; and the taste of it was like the taste of cakes baked with oil. 
NUM.11.9	When the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell with it.
NUM.11.10	Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent; and the anger of the 
NUM.11.11	Moses said to the 
NUM.11.12	Did I conceive all this people? Did I bring them forth, that thou shouldst say to me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries the sucking child,’ to the land which thou didst swear to give their fathers? 
NUM.11.13	Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they weep before me and say, ‘Give us meat, that we may eat.’ 
NUM.11.14	I am not able to carry all this people alone, the burden is too heavy for me. 
NUM.11.15	If thou wilt deal thus with me, kill me at once, if I find favor in thy sight, that I may not see my wretchedness.”
NUM.11.16	And the 
NUM.11.17	And I will come down and talk with you there; and I will take some of the spirit which is upon you and put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you may not bear it yourself alone. 
NUM.11.18	And say to the people, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat; for you have wept in the hearing of the 
NUM.11.19	You shall not eat one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days, 
NUM.11.20	but a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have rejected the 
NUM.11.21	But Moses said, “The people among whom I am number six hundred thousand on foot; and thou hast said, ‘I will give them meat, that they may eat a whole month!’ 
NUM.11.22	Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to suffice them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?” 
NUM.11.23	And the 
NUM.11.24	So Moses went out and told the people the words of the 
NUM.11.25	Then the 
NUM.11.26	Now two men remained in the camp, one named Eldad, and the other named Medad, and the spirit rested upon them; they were among those registered, but they had not gone out to the tent, and so they prophesied in the camp. 
NUM.11.27	And a young man ran and told Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.” 
NUM.11.28	And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, said, “My lord Moses, forbid them.” 
NUM.11.29	But Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the 
NUM.11.30	And Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.
NUM.11.31	And there went forth a wind from the 
NUM.11.32	And the people rose all that day, and all night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails; he who gathered least gathered ten homers; and they spread them out for themselves all around the camp. 
NUM.11.33	While the meat was yet between their teeth, before it was consumed, the anger of the 
NUM.11.34	 Therefore the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah,
NUM.11.35	From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth; and they remained at Hazeroth.
NUM.12.1	Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married, for he had married a Cushite woman; 
NUM.12.2	and they said, “Has the 
NUM.12.3	Now the man Moses was very meek, more than all men that were on the face of the earth. 
NUM.12.4	And suddenly the 
NUM.12.5	And the 
NUM.12.6	And he said, “Hear my words: If there is a prophet among you, I the 
NUM.12.7	 Not so with my servant Moses; he is entrusted with all my house. 
NUM.12.8	 With him I speak mouth to mouth, clearly, and not in dark speech; and he beholds the form of the 
NUM.12.9	And the anger of the 
NUM.12.10	and when the cloud removed from over the tent, behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. And Aaron turned towards Miriam, and behold, she was leprous. 
NUM.12.11	And Aaron said to Moses, “Oh, my lord, do not
NUM.12.12	Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb.” 
NUM.12.13	And Moses cried to the 
NUM.12.14	But the 
NUM.12.15	So Miriam was shut up outside the camp seven days; and the people did not set out on the march till Miriam was brought in again. 
NUM.12.16	After that the people set out from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.
NUM.13.1	The 
NUM.13.2	“Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I give to the people of Israel; from each tribe of their fathers shall you send a man, every one a leader among them.” 
NUM.13.3	So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran, according to the command of the 
NUM.13.4	And these were their names: From the tribe of Reuben, Shammu-a the son of Zaccur; 
NUM.13.5	from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori; 
NUM.13.6	from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh; 
NUM.13.7	from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph; 
NUM.13.8	from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun; 
NUM.13.9	from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu; 
NUM.13.10	from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi; 
NUM.13.11	from the tribe of Joseph (that is from the tribe of Manasseh), Gaddi the son of Susi; 
NUM.13.12	from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli; 
NUM.13.13	from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael; 
NUM.13.14	from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi; 
NUM.13.15	from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. 
NUM.13.16	These were the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.
NUM.13.17	Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, “Go up into the Negeb yonder, and go up into the hill country, 
NUM.13.18	and see what the land is, and whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak, whether they are few or many, 
NUM.13.19	and whether the land that they dwell in is good or bad, and whether the cities that they dwell in are camps or strongholds, 
NUM.13.20	and whether the land is rich or poor, and whether there is wood in it or not. Be of good courage, and bring some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes.
NUM.13.21	So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, near the entrance of Hamath. 
NUM.13.22	They went up into the Negeb, and came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, were there. (Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) 
NUM.13.23	And they came to the Valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with a single cluster of grapes, and they carried it on a pole between two of them; they brought also some pomegranates and figs. 
NUM.13.24	That place was called the Valley of Eshcol,
NUM.13.25	At the end of forty days they returned from spying out the land. 
NUM.13.26	And they came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the people of Israel in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh; they brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land. 
NUM.13.27	And they told him, “We came to the land to which you sent us; it flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit. 
NUM.13.28	Yet the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large; and besides, we saw the descendants of Anak there. 
NUM.13.29	The Amalekites dwell in the land of the Negeb; the Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the hill country; and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and along the Jordan.”
NUM.13.30	But Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, “Let us go up at once, and occupy it; for we are well able to overcome it.” 
NUM.13.31	Then the men who had gone up with him said, “We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.” 
NUM.13.32	So they brought to the people of Israel an evil report of the land which they had spied out, saying, “The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants; and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature. 
NUM.13.33	 And there we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim); and we seemed to ourselves like grasshoppers, and so we seemed to them.”
NUM.14.1	Then all the congregation raised a loud cry; and the people wept that night. 
NUM.14.2	And all the people of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron; the whole congregation said to them, “Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or would that we had died in this wilderness! 
NUM.14.3	 Why does the 
NUM.14.4	And they said to one another, “Let us choose a captain, and go back to Egypt.” 
NUM.14.5	Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the people of Israel. 
NUM.14.6	And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had spied out the land, rent their clothes, 
NUM.14.7	and said to all the congregation of the people of Israel, “The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceedingly good land. 
NUM.14.8	If the 
NUM.14.9	Only, do not rebel against the 
NUM.14.10	But all the congregation said to stone them with stones.
NUM.14.10	Then the glory of the 
NUM.14.11	 And the 
NUM.14.12	I will strike them with the pestilence and disinherit them, and I will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.”
NUM.14.13	But Moses said to the 
NUM.14.14	and they will tell the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that thou, O 
NUM.14.15	Now if thou dost kill this people as one man, then the nations who have heard thy fame will say, 
NUM.14.16	‘Because the 
NUM.14.17	And now, I pray thee, let the power of the 
NUM.14.18	‘The 
NUM.14.19	Pardon the iniquity of this people, I pray thee, according to the greatness of thy steadfast love, and according as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.”
NUM.14.20	Then the 
NUM.14.21	but truly, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the 
NUM.14.22	 none of the men who have seen my glory and my signs which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, and yet have put me to the proof these ten times and have not hearkened to my voice, 
NUM.14.23	shall see the land which I swore to give to their fathers; and none of those who despised me shall see it. 
NUM.14.24	But my servant Caleb, because he has a different spirit and has followed me fully, I will bring into the land into which he went, and his descendants shall possess it. 
NUM.14.25	Now, since the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwell in the valleys, turn tomorrow and set out for the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.”
NUM.14.26	And the 
NUM.14.27	“How long shall this wicked congregation murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the people of Israel, which they murmur against me. 
NUM.14.28	Say to them, ‘As I live, says the 
NUM.14.29	 your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and of all your number, numbered from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against me, 
NUM.14.30	not one shall come into the land where I swore that I would make you dwell, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun. 
NUM.14.31	But your little ones, who you said would become a prey, I will bring in, and they shall know the land which you have despised. 
NUM.14.32	But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness. 
NUM.14.33	 And your children shall be shepherds in the wilderness forty years, and shall suffer for your faithlessness, until the last of your dead bodies lies in the wilderness. 
NUM.14.34	According to the number of the days in which you spied out the land, forty days, for every day a year, you shall bear your iniquity, forty years, and you shall know my displeasure.’ 
NUM.14.35	I, the 
NUM.14.36	And the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, and who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up an evil report against the land, 
NUM.14.37	the men who brought up an evil report of the land, died by plague before the 
NUM.14.38	But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive, of those men who went to spy out the land.
NUM.14.39	And Moses told these words to all the people of Israel, and the people mourned greatly. 
NUM.14.40	And they rose early in the morning, and went up to the heights of the hill country, saying, “See, we are here, we will go up to the place which the 
NUM.14.41	But Moses said, “Why now are you transgressing the command of the 
NUM.14.42	Do not go up lest you be struck down before your enemies, for the 
NUM.14.43	For there the Amalekites and the Canaanites are before you, and you shall fall by the sword; because you have turned back from following the 
NUM.14.44	But they presumed to go up to the heights of the hill country, although neither the ark of the covenant of the

NUM.15.1	The 
NUM.15.2	“Say to the people of Israel, When you come into the land you are to inhabit, which I give you, 
NUM.15.3	and you offer to the 
NUM.15.4	then he who brings his offering shall offer to the 
NUM.15.5	and wine for the drink offering, a fourth of a hin, you shall prepare with the burnt offering, or for the sacrifice, for each lamb. 
NUM.15.6	Or for a ram, you shall prepare for a cereal offering two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil; 
NUM.15.7	and for the drink offering you shall offer a third of a hin of wine, a pleasing odor to the 
NUM.15.8	And when you prepare a bull for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice, to fulfil a vow, or for peace offerings to the 
NUM.15.9	then one shall offer with the bull a cereal offering of three tenths of an ephah of fine flour, mixed with half a hin of oil, 
NUM.15.10	and you shall offer for the drink offering half a hin of wine, as an offering by fire, a pleasing odor to the 
NUM.15.11	“Thus it shall be done for each bull or ram, or for each of the male lambs or the kids. 
NUM.15.12	According to the number that you prepare, so shall you do with every one according to their number. 
NUM.15.13	All who are native shall do these things in this way, in offering an offering by fire, a pleasing odor to the 
NUM.15.14	 And if a stranger is sojourning with you, or any one is among you throughout your generations, and he wishes to offer an offering by fire, a pleasing odor to the 
NUM.15.15	For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you and for the stranger who sojourns with you, a perpetual statute throughout your generations; as you are, so shall the sojourner be before the 
NUM.15.16	One law and one ordinance shall be for you and for the stranger who sojourns with you.”
NUM.15.18	“Say to the people of Israel, When you come into the land to which I bring you 
NUM.15.19	and when you eat of the food of the land, you shall present an offering to the 
NUM.15.20	Of the first of your coarse meal you shall present a cake as an offering; as an offering from the threshing floor, so shall you present it. 
NUM.15.21	Of the first of your coarse meal you shall give to the 
NUM.15.23	all that the 
NUM.15.24	then if it was done unwittingly without the knowledge of the congregation, all the congregation shall offer one young bull for a burnt offering, a pleasing odor to the 
NUM.15.25	And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the people of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; because it was an error, and they have brought their offering, an offering by fire to the 
NUM.15.26	And all the congregation of the people of Israel shall be forgiven, and the stranger who sojourns among them, because the whole population was involved in the error.
NUM.15.28	And the priest shall make atonement before the 
NUM.15.29	You shall have one law for him who does anything unwittingly, for him who is native among the people of Israel, and for the stranger who sojourns among them. 
NUM.15.30	But the person who does anything with a high hand, whether he is native or a sojourner, reviles the 
NUM.15.31	Because he has despised the word of the 
NUM.15.32	While the people of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the sabbath day. 
NUM.15.33	And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation. 
NUM.15.34	They put him in custody, because it had not been made plain what should be done to him. 
NUM.15.35	And the 
NUM.15.36	And all the congregation brought him outside the camp, and stoned him to death with stones, as the 
NUM.15.37	The 
NUM.15.38	 “Speak to the people of Israel, and bid them to make tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and to put upon the tassel of each corner a cord of blue; 
NUM.15.39	and it shall be to you a tassel to look upon and remember all the commandments of the 
NUM.15.40	So you shall remember and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God.

NUM.16.1	Now Korah the son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, and On the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, 
NUM.16.2	took men; and they rose up before Moses, with a number of the people of Israel, two hundred and fifty leaders of the congregation, chosen from the assembly, well-known men; 
NUM.16.3	and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, “You have gone too far! For all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the 
NUM.16.4	When Moses heard it, he fell on his face; 
NUM.16.5	 and he said to Korah and all his company, “In the morning the 
NUM.16.6	Do this: take censers, Korah and all his company; 
NUM.16.7	put fire in them and put incense upon them before the 
NUM.16.8	And Moses said to Korah, “Hear now, you sons of Levi: 
NUM.16.9	is it too small a thing for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do service in the tabernacle of the 
NUM.16.10	and that he has brought you near him, and all your brethren the sons of Levi with you? And would you seek the priesthood also? 
NUM.16.11	Therefore it is against the 
NUM.16.12	And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab; and they said, “We will not come up. 
NUM.16.13	Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, that you must also make yourself a prince over us? 
NUM.16.14	Moreover you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up.”
NUM.16.15	And Moses was very angry, and said to the 
NUM.16.16	And Moses said to Korah, “Be present, you and all your company, before the 
NUM.16.17	and let every one of you take his censer, and put incense upon it, and every one of you bring before the 
NUM.16.18	So every man took his censer, and they put fire in them and laid incense upon them, and they stood at the entrance of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron. 
NUM.16.19	Then Korah assembled all the congregation against them at the entrance of the tent of meeting. And the glory of the 
NUM.16.20	And the 
NUM.16.21	“Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.” 
NUM.16.22	And they fell on their faces, and said, “O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be angry with all the congregation?” 
NUM.16.23	And the 
NUM.16.24	“Say to the congregation, Get away from about the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.”
NUM.16.25	Then Moses rose and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him. 
NUM.16.26	And he said to the congregation, “Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be swept away with all their sins.” 
NUM.16.27	So they got away from about the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; and Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the door of their tents, together with their wives, their sons, and their little ones. 
NUM.16.28	And Moses said, “Hereby you shall know that the 
NUM.16.29	If these men die the common death of all men, or if they are visited by the fate of all men, then the 
NUM.16.30	But if the 
NUM.16.31	And as he finished speaking all these words, the ground under them split asunder; 
NUM.16.32	and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households and all the men that belonged to Korah and all their goods. 
NUM.16.33	So they and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol; and the earth closed over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly. 
NUM.16.34	And all Israel that were round about them fled at their cry; for they said, “Lest the earth swallow us up!” 
NUM.16.35	And fire came forth from the 
NUM.16.37	“Tell Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest to take up the censers out of the blaze; then scatter the fire far and wide. For they are holy, 
NUM.16.38	the censers of these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives; so let them be made into hammered plates as a covering for the altar, for they offered them before the 
NUM.16.39	So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burned had offered; and they were hammered out as a covering for the altar, 
NUM.16.40	to be a reminder to the people of Israel, so that no one who is not a priest, who is not of the descendants of Aaron, should draw near to burn incense before the 
NUM.16.41	But on the morrow all the congregation of the people of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, “You have killed the people of the 
NUM.16.42	And when the congregation had assembled against Moses and against Aaron, they turned toward the tent of meeting; and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the 
NUM.16.43	And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting, 
NUM.16.44	and the 
NUM.16.45	“Get away from the midst of this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.” And they fell on their faces. 
NUM.16.46	And Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and lay incense on it, and carry it quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them; for wrath has gone forth from the 
NUM.16.47	So Aaron took it as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and behold, the plague had already begun among the people; and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people. 
NUM.16.48	And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stopped. 
NUM.16.49	Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those who died in the affair of Korah. 
NUM.16.50	And Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the tent of meeting, when the plague was stopped.
NUM.17.2	“Speak to the people of Israel, and get from them rods, one for each fathers' house, from all their leaders according to their fathers' houses, twelve rods. Write each man's name upon his rod, 
NUM.17.3	and write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi. For there shall be one rod for the head of each fathers' house. 
NUM.17.4	Then you shall deposit them in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you. 
NUM.17.5	And the rod of the man whom I choose shall sprout; thus I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the people of Israel, which they murmur against you.” 
NUM.17.6	Moses spoke to the people of Israel; and all their leaders gave him rods, one for each leader, according to their fathers' houses, twelve rods; and the rod of Aaron was among their rods. 
NUM.17.7	And Moses deposited the rods before the 
NUM.17.8	And on the morrow Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi had sprouted and put forth buds, and produced blossoms, and it bore ripe almonds. 
NUM.17.9	Then Moses brought out all the rods from before the 
NUM.17.10	And the 
NUM.17.11	Thus did Moses; as the 
NUM.17.12	And the people of Israel said to Moses, “Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone. 
NUM.17.13	Every one who comes near, who comes near to the tabernacle of the 
NUM.18.1	So the 
NUM.18.2	And with you bring your brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, that they may join you, and minister to you while you and your sons with you are before the tent of the testimony. 
NUM.18.3	 They shall attend you and attend to all duties of the tent; but shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary or to the altar, lest they, and you, die. 
NUM.18.4	They shall join you, and attend to the tent of meeting, for all the service of the tent; and no one else shall come near you. 
NUM.18.5	And you shall attend to the duties of the sanctuary and the duties of the altar, that there be wrath no more upon the people of Israel. 
NUM.18.6	And behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the people of Israel; they are a gift to you, given to the 
NUM.18.7	And you and your sons with you shall attend to your priesthood for all that concerns the altar and that is within the veil; and you shall serve. I give your priesthood as a gift,
NUM.18.8	Then the 
NUM.18.9	This shall be yours of the most holy things, reserved from the fire; every offering of theirs, every cereal offering of theirs and every sin offering of theirs and every guilt offering of theirs, which they render to me, shall be most holy to you and to your sons. 
NUM.18.10	In a most holy place shall you eat of it; every male may eat of it; it is holy to you. 
NUM.18.11	This also is yours, the offering of their gift, all the wave offerings of the people of Israel; I have given them to you, and to your sons and daughters with you, as a perpetual due; every one who is clean in your house may eat of it. 
NUM.18.12	All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine and of the grain, the first fruits of what they give to the 
NUM.18.13	The first ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to the 
NUM.18.14	 Every devoted thing in Israel shall be yours. 
NUM.18.15	Everything that opens the womb of all flesh, whether man or beast, which they offer to the 
NUM.18.16	And their redemption price (at a month old you shall redeem them) you shall fix at five shekels in silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs. 
NUM.18.17	But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shall burn their fat as an offering by fire, a pleasing odor to the 
NUM.18.18	but their flesh shall be yours, as the breast that is waved and as the right thigh are yours. 
NUM.18.19	 All the holy offerings which the people of Israel present to the 
NUM.18.20	And the 
NUM.18.21	“To the Levites I have given every tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, their service in the tent of meeting. 
NUM.18.22	And henceforth the people of Israel shall not come near the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin and die. 
NUM.18.23	But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations; and among the people of Israel they shall have no inheritance. 
NUM.18.24	For the tithe of the people of Israel, which they present as an offering to the 
NUM.18.25	And the 
NUM.18.26	“Moreover you shall say to the Levites, ‘When you take from the people of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you shall present an offering from it to the 
NUM.18.27	And your offering shall be reckoned to you as though it were the grain of the threshing floor, and as the fulness of the wine press. 
NUM.18.28	So shall you also present an offering to the 
NUM.18.29	Out of all the gifts to you, you shall present every offering due to the 
NUM.18.30	Therefore you shall say to them, ‘When you have offered from it the best of it, then the rest shall be reckoned to the Levites as produce of the threshing floor, and as produce of the wine press; 
NUM.18.31	and you may eat it in any place, you and your households; for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting. 
NUM.18.32	And you shall bear no sin by reason of it, when you have offered the best of it. And you shall not profane the holy things of the people of Israel, lest you die.’ ”
NUM.19.1	Now the 
NUM.19.2	“This is the statute of the law which the 
NUM.19.3	And you shall give her to Eleazar the priest, and she shall be taken outside the camp and slaughtered before him; 
NUM.19.4	and Eleazar the priest shall take some of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle some of her blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times. 
NUM.19.5	And the heifer shall be burned in his sight; her skin, her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall be burned; 
NUM.19.6	and the priest shall take cedarwood and hyssop and scarlet stuff, and cast them into the midst of the burning of the heifer. 
NUM.19.7	Then the priest shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterwards he shall come into the camp; and the priest shall be unclean until evening. 
NUM.19.8	He who burns the heifer shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his body in water, and shall be unclean until evening. 
NUM.19.9	And a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place; and they shall be kept for the congregation of the people of Israel for the water for impurity, for the removal of sin. 
NUM.19.10	And he who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until evening. And this shall be to the people of Israel, and to the stranger who sojourns among them, a perpetual statute.
NUM.19.11	“He who touches the dead body of any person shall be unclean seven days; 
NUM.19.12	he shall cleanse himself with the water on the third day and on the seventh day, and so be clean; but if he does not cleanse himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he will not become clean. 
NUM.19.13	Whoever touches a dead person, the body of any man who has died, and does not cleanse himself, defiles the tabernacle of the 
NUM.19.14	“This is the law when a man dies in a tent: every one who comes into the tent, and every one who is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days. 
NUM.19.15	And every open vessel, which has no cover fastened upon it, is unclean. 
NUM.19.16	Whoever in the open field touches one who is slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days. 
NUM.19.17	For the unclean they shall take some ashes of the burnt sin offering, and running water shall be added in a vessel; 
NUM.19.18	then a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the furnishings, and upon the persons who were there, and upon him who touched the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave; 
NUM.19.19	and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day; thus on the seventh day he shall cleanse him, and he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and at evening he shall be clean.
NUM.19.20	“But the man who is unclean and does not cleanse himself, that person shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, since he has defiled the sanctuary of the 
NUM.19.21	And it shall be a perpetual statute for them. He who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes; and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening. 
NUM.19.22	And whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and any one who touches it shall be unclean until evening.”
NUM.20.1	And the people of Israel, the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month, and the people stayed in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.
NUM.20.3	And the people contended with Moses, and said, “Would that we had died when our brethren died before the 
NUM.20.4	Why have you brought the assembly of the 
NUM.20.5	And why have you made us come up out of Egypt, to bring us to this evil place? It is no place for grain, or figs, or vines, or pomegranates; and there is no water to drink.” 
NUM.20.6	Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tent of meeting, and fell on their faces. And the glory of the 
NUM.20.7	and the 
NUM.20.8	“Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, you and Aaron your brother, and tell the rock before their eyes to yield its water; so you shall bring water out of the rock for them; so you shall give drink to the congregation and their cattle.” 
NUM.20.9	And Moses took the rod from before the 
NUM.20.10	And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, “Hear now, you rebels; shall we bring forth water for you out of this rock?” 
NUM.20.11	And Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock with his rod twice; and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their cattle. 
NUM.20.12	And the 
NUM.20.13	These are the waters of Meribah,
NUM.20.14	Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, “Thus says your brother Israel: You know all the adversity that has befallen us: 
NUM.20.15	how our fathers went down to Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt harshly with us and our fathers; 
NUM.20.16	and when we cried to the 
NUM.20.17	Now let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or vineyard, neither will we drink water from a well; we will go along the King's Highway, we will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left, until we have passed through your territory.” 
NUM.20.18	But Edom said to him, “You shall not pass through, lest I come out with the sword against you.” 
NUM.20.19	And the people of Israel said to him, “We will go up by the highway; and if we drink of your water, I and my cattle, then I will pay for it; let me only pass through on foot, nothing more.” 
NUM.20.20	But he said, “You shall not pass through.” And Edom came out against them with many men, and with a strong force. 
NUM.20.21	Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory; so Israel turned away from him.
NUM.20.22	And they journeyed from Kadesh, and the people of Israel, the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor. 
NUM.20.23	And the 
NUM.20.24	“Aaron shall be gathered to his people; for he shall not enter the land which I have given to the people of Israel, because you rebelled against my command at the waters of Meribah. 
NUM.20.25	 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor; 
NUM.20.26	and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron shall be gathered to his people, and shall die there.” 
NUM.20.27	Moses did as the 
NUM.20.28	And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. 
NUM.20.29	And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days.
NUM.21.2	And Israel vowed a vow to the 
NUM.21.3	And the 
NUM.21.4	From Mount Hor they set out by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom; and the people became impatient on the way. 
NUM.21.5	And the people spoke against God and against Moses, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we loathe this worthless food.” 
NUM.21.6	Then the 
NUM.21.7	And the people came to Moses, and said, “We have sinned, for we have spoken against the 
NUM.21.8	And the 
NUM.21.9	So Moses made a bronze serpent, and set it on a pole; and if a serpent bit any man, he would look at the bronze serpent and live.
NUM.21.10	And the people of Israel set out, and encamped in Oboth. 
NUM.21.11	And they set out from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is opposite Moab, toward the sunrise. 
NUM.21.12	From there they set out, and encamped in the Valley of Zered. 
NUM.21.13	From there they set out, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that extends from the boundary of the Amorites; for the Arnon is the boundary of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. 
NUM.21.14	Wherefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the 
NUM.21.14	“Waheb in Suphah,
NUM.21.14	and the valleys of the Arnon,
NUM.21.15	and the slope of the valleys
NUM.21.15	that extends to the seat of Ar,
NUM.21.15	and leans to the border of Moab.”
NUM.21.16	And from there they continued to Beer;
NUM.21.17	Then Israel sang this song:
NUM.21.17	“Spring up, O well!—Sing to it!—
NUM.21.18	the well which the princes dug,
NUM.21.18	which the nobles of the people delved,
NUM.21.18	with the scepter and with their staves.”
NUM.21.18	And from the wilderness they went on to Mattanah, 
NUM.21.19	and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth, 
NUM.21.20	and from Bamoth to the valley lying in the region of Moab by the top of Pisgah which looks down upon the desert.
NUM.21.22	“Let me pass through your land; we will not turn aside into field or vineyard; we will not drink the water of a well; we will go by the King's Highway, until we have passed through your territory.” 
NUM.21.23	But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory. He gathered all his men together, and went out against Israel to the wilderness, and came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel. 
NUM.21.24	And Israel slew him with the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as to the Ammonites; for Jazer was the boundary of the Ammonites.
NUM.21.25	And Israel took all these cities, and Israel settled in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages. 
NUM.21.26	For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land out of his hand, as far as the Arnon. 
NUM.21.27	Therefore the ballad singers say,
NUM.21.27	“Come to Heshbon, let it be built,
NUM.21.27	let the city of Sihon be established.
NUM.21.28	For fire went forth from Heshbon,
NUM.21.28	flame from the city of Sihon.
NUM.21.28	It devoured Ar of Moab,
NUM.21.28	the lords of the heights of the Arnon.
NUM.21.29	Woe to you, O Moab!
NUM.21.29	You are undone, O people of Chemosh!
NUM.21.29	He has made his sons fugitives,
NUM.21.29	and his daughters captives,
NUM.21.29	to an Amorite king, Sihon.
NUM.21.30	So their posterity perished from Heshbon,
NUM.21.30	and we laid waste until fire spread to Medeba.”
NUM.21.31	Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites. 
NUM.21.32	And Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took its villages, and dispossessed the Amorites that were there. 
NUM.21.33	 Then they turned and went up by the way to Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan came out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edre-i. 
NUM.21.34	But the 
NUM.21.35	So they slew him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was not one survivor left to him; and they possessed his land.
NUM.22.2	And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. 
NUM.22.3	And Moab was in great dread of the people, because they were many; Moab was overcome with fear of the people of Israel. 
NUM.22.4	And Moab said to the elders of Midian, “This horde will now lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field.” So Balak the son of Zippor, who was king of Moab at that time, 
NUM.22.5	sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor at Pethor, which is near the River, in the land of Amaw to call him, saying, “Behold, a people has come out of Egypt; they cover the face of the earth, and they are dwelling opposite me. 
NUM.22.6	Come now, curse this people for me, since they are too mighty for me; perhaps I shall be able to defeat them and drive them from the land; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.”
NUM.22.7	So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the fees for divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and gave him Balak's message. 
NUM.22.8	And he said to them, “Lodge here this night, and I will bring back word to you, as the 
NUM.22.9	And God came to Balaam and said, “Who are these men with you?” 
NUM.22.10	And Balaam said to God, “Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me, saying, 
NUM.22.11	‘Behold, a people has come out of Egypt, and it covers the face of the earth; now come, curse them for me; perhaps I shall be able to fight against them and drive them out.’ ” 
NUM.22.12	God said to Balaam, “You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.” 
NUM.22.13	So Balaam rose in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, “Go to your own land; for the 
NUM.22.14	So the princes of Moab rose and went to Balak, and said, “Balaam refuses to come with us.”
NUM.22.15	Once again Balak sent princes, more in number and more honorable than they. 
NUM.22.16	And they came to Balaam and said to him, “Thus says Balak the son of Zippor: ‘Let nothing hinder you from coming to me; 
NUM.22.17	for I will surely do you great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do; come, curse this people for me.’ ” 
NUM.22.18	But Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, “Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the command of the 
NUM.22.19	Pray, now, tarry here this night also, that I may know what more the 
NUM.22.20	And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, “If the men have come to call you, rise, go with them; but only what I bid you, that shall you do.”
NUM.22.21	So Balaam rose in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab. 
NUM.22.22	But God's anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of the 
NUM.22.23	And the ass saw the angel of the 
NUM.22.24	Then the angel of the 
NUM.22.25	And when the ass saw the angel of the 
NUM.22.26	Then the angel of the 
NUM.22.27	When the ass saw the angel of the 
NUM.22.28	Then the 
NUM.22.29	And Balaam said to the ass, “Because you have made sport of me. I wish I had a sword in my hand, for then I would kill you.” 
NUM.22.30	And the ass said to Balaam, “Am I not your ass, upon which you have ridden all your life long to this day? Was I ever accustomed to do so to you?” And he said, “No.”
NUM.22.31	Then the 
NUM.22.32	And the angel of the 
NUM.22.33	and the ass saw me, and turned aside before me these three times. If she had not turned aside from me, surely just now I would have slain you and let her live.” 
NUM.22.34	Then Balaam said to the angel of the 
NUM.22.35	And the angel of the 
NUM.22.36	When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, on the boundary formed by the Arnon, at the extremity of the boundary. 
NUM.22.37	And Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not send to you to call you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not able to honor you?” 
NUM.22.38	Balaam said to Balak, “Lo, I have come to you! Have I now any power at all to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that must I speak.” 
NUM.22.39	Then Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth. 
NUM.22.40	And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam and to the princes who were with him.
NUM.22.41	And on the morrow Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth-baal; and from there he saw the nearest of the people.
NUM.23.1	And Balaam said to Balak, “Build for me here seven altars, and provide for me here seven bulls and seven rams.” 
NUM.23.2	Balak did as Balaam had said; and Balak and Balaam offered on each altar a bull and a ram. 
NUM.23.3	And Balaam said to Balak, “Stand beside your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps the 
NUM.23.4	And God met Balaam; and Balaam said to him, “I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered upon each altar a bull and a ram.” 
NUM.23.5	And the 
NUM.23.6	And he returned to him, and lo, he and all the princes of Moab were standing beside his burnt offering. 
NUM.23.7	And Balaam took up his discourse, and said,
NUM.23.7	“From Aram Balak has brought me,
NUM.23.7	the king of Moab from the eastern mountains:
NUM.23.7	‘Come, curse Jacob for me,
NUM.23.7	and come, denounce Israel!’
NUM.23.8	How can I curse whom God has not cursed?
NUM.23.8	How can I denounce whom the 
NUM.23.9	For from the top of the mountains I see him,
NUM.23.9	from the hills I behold him;
NUM.23.9	lo, a people dwelling alone,
NUM.23.9	and not reckoning itself among the nations!
NUM.23.10	Who can count the dust of Jacob,
NUM.23.10	or number the fourth part
NUM.23.10	Let me die the death of the righteous,
NUM.23.10	and let my end be like his!”
NUM.23.11	And Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have done nothing but bless them.” 
NUM.23.12	And he answered, “Must I not take heed to speak what the 
NUM.23.13	And Balak said to him, “Come with me to another place, from which you may see them; you shall see only the nearest of them, and shall not see them all; then curse them for me from there.” 
NUM.23.14	And he took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
NUM.23.15	Balaam said to Balak, “Stand here beside your burnt offering, while I meet the 
NUM.23.16	And the 
NUM.23.17	And he came to him, and lo, he was standing beside his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, “What has the 
NUM.23.18	And Balaam took up his discourse, and said,
NUM.23.18	“Rise, Balak, and hear;
NUM.23.18	hearken to me, O son of Zippor:
NUM.23.19	God is not man, that he should lie,
NUM.23.19	or a son of man, that he should repent.
NUM.23.19	Has he said, and will he not do it?
NUM.23.19	Or has he spoken, and will he not fulfil it?
NUM.23.20	Behold, I received a command to bless:
NUM.23.20	he has blessed, and I cannot revoke it.
NUM.23.21	He has not beheld misfortune in Jacob;
NUM.23.21	nor has he seen trouble in Israel.
NUM.23.21	The 
NUM.23.21	and the shout of a king is among them.
NUM.23.22	God brings them out of Egypt;
NUM.23.22	they have as it were the horns of the wild ox.
NUM.23.23	For there is no enchantment against Jacob,
NUM.23.23	no divination against Israel;
NUM.23.23	now it shall be said of Jacob and Israel,
NUM.23.23	‘What has God wrought!’
NUM.23.24	Behold, a people! As a lioness it rises up
NUM.23.24	and as a lion it lifts itself;
NUM.23.24	it does not lie down till it devours the prey,
NUM.23.24	and drinks the blood of the slain.”
NUM.23.25	And Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.” 
NUM.23.26	But Balaam answered Balak, “Did I not tell you, ‘All that the 
NUM.23.27	And Balak said to Balaam, “Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.” 
NUM.23.28	So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that overlooks the desert.
NUM.23.29	And Balaam said to Balak, “Build for me here seven altars, and provide for me here seven bulls and seven rams.” 
NUM.23.30	And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
NUM.24.1	When Balaam saw that it pleased the 
NUM.24.2	And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and saw Israel encamping tribe by tribe. And the Spirit of God came upon him, 
NUM.24.3	and he took up his discourse, and said,
NUM.24.3	“The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor,
NUM.24.3	the oracle of the man whose eye is opened,
NUM.24.4	the oracle of him who hears the words of God,
NUM.24.4	who sees the vision of the Almighty,
NUM.24.4	falling down, but having his eyes uncovered:
NUM.24.5	How fair are your tents, O Jacob,
NUM.24.5	your encampments, O Israel!
NUM.24.6	Like valleys that stretch afar,
NUM.24.6	like gardens beside a river,
NUM.24.6	like aloes that the 
NUM.24.6	like cedar trees beside the waters.
NUM.24.7	Water shall flow from his buckets,
NUM.24.7	and his seed shall be in many waters,
NUM.24.7	his king shall be higher than Agag,
NUM.24.7	and his kingdom shall be exalted.
NUM.24.8	God brings him out of Egypt;
NUM.24.8	he has as it were the horns of the wild ox,
NUM.24.8	he shall eat up the nations his adversaries,
NUM.24.8	and shall break their bones in pieces,
NUM.24.8	and pierce them through with his arrows.
NUM.24.9	and like a lioness; who will rouse him up?
NUM.24.9	Blessed be every one who blesses you,
NUM.24.9	and cursed be every one who curses you.”
NUM.24.10	And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, “I called you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed them these three times. 
NUM.24.11	Therefore now flee to your place; I said, ‘I will certainly honor you,’ but the 
NUM.24.12	And Balaam said to Balak, “Did I not tell your messengers whom you sent to me, 
NUM.24.13	‘If Balak should give me his house full of silver and gold, I would not be able to go beyond the word of the 
NUM.24.14	And now, behold, I am going to my people; come, I will let you know what this people will do to your people in the latter days.” 
NUM.24.15	And he took up his discourse, and said,
NUM.24.15	“The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor,
NUM.24.15	the oracle of the man whose eye is opened,
NUM.24.16	the oracle of him who hears the words of God,
NUM.24.16	and knows the knowledge of the Most High,
NUM.24.16	who sees the vision of the Almighty,
NUM.24.16	falling down, but having his eyes uncovered:
NUM.24.17	I see him, but not now;
NUM.24.17	I behold him, but not nigh:
NUM.24.17	a star shall come forth out of Jacob,
NUM.24.17	and a scepter shall rise out of Israel;
NUM.24.17	it shall crush the forehead
NUM.24.17	and break down all the sons of Sheth.
NUM.24.18	Edom shall be dispossessed,
NUM.24.18	Seir also, his enemies, shall be dispossessed,
NUM.24.18	while Israel does valiantly.
NUM.24.19	By Jacob shall dominion be exercised,
NUM.24.19	and the survivors of cities be destroyed!”
NUM.24.20	Then he looked on Amalek, and took up his discourse, and said,
NUM.24.20	“Amalek was the first of the nations,
NUM.24.20	but in the end he shall come to destruction.”
NUM.24.21	And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his discourse, and said,
NUM.24.21	“Enduring is your dwelling place,
NUM.24.21	and your nest is set in the rock;
NUM.24.22	nevertheless Kain shall be wasted.
NUM.24.22	How long shall Asshur take you away captive?”
NUM.24.23	And he took up his discourse, and said,
NUM.24.23	“Alas, who shall live when God does this?
NUM.24.24	But ships shall come from Kittim
NUM.24.24	and shall afflict Asshur and Eber;
NUM.24.24	and he also shall come to destruction.”
NUM.24.25	Then Balaam rose, and went back to his place; and Balak also went his way.
NUM.25.1	While Israel dwelt in Shittim the people began to play the harlot with the daughters of Moab. 
NUM.25.2	These invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate, and bowed down to their gods. 
NUM.25.3	So Israel yoked himself to Baal of Peor. And the anger of the 
NUM.25.4	and the 
NUM.25.5	And Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Every one of you slay his men who have yoked themselves to Baal of Peor.”
NUM.25.6	And behold, one of the people of Israel came and brought a Midianite woman to his family, in the sight of Moses and in the sight of the whole congregation of the people of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting. 
NUM.25.7	When Phinehas the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose and left the congregation, and took a spear in his hand 
NUM.25.8	and went after the man of Israel into the inner room, and pierced both of them, the man of Israel and the woman, through her body. Thus the plague was stayed from the people of Israel. 
NUM.25.9	Nevertheless those that died by the plague were twenty-four thousand.
NUM.25.10	And the 
NUM.25.11	“Phinehas the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, has turned back my wrath from the people of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I did not consume the people of Israel in my jealousy. 
NUM.25.12	Therefore say, ‘Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace; 
NUM.25.13	and it shall be to him, and to his descendants after him, the covenant of a perpetual priesthood, because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the people of Israel.’ ”
NUM.25.14	The name of the slain man of Israel, who was slain with the Midianite woman, was Zimri the son of Salu, head of a fathers' house belonging to the Simeonites. 
NUM.25.15	And the name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi the daughter of Zur, who was the head of the people of a fathers' house in Midian.
NUM.25.16	And the 
NUM.25.17	“Harass the Midianites, and smite them; 
NUM.25.18	for they have harassed you with their wiles, with which they beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague on account of Peor.”
NUM.26.1	After the plague the 
NUM.26.2	“Take a census of all the congregation of the people of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers' houses, all in Israel who are able to go forth to war.” 
NUM.26.3	And Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying, 
NUM.26.4	“Take a census of the people,
NUM.26.6	of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites; of Carmi, the family of the Carmites.

NUM.26.61	But Nadab and Abihu died when they offered unholy fire before the 
NUM.26.62	And those numbered of them were twenty-three thousand, every male from a month old and upward; for they were not numbered among the people of Israel, because there was no inheritance given to them among the people of Israel.
NUM.26.63	These were those numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the people of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho. 
NUM.26.64	 But among these there was not a man of those numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest, who had numbered the people of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai. 
NUM.26.65	For the 
NUM.27.2	And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the leaders and all the congregation, at the door of the tent of meeting, saying,

NUM.27.4	Why should the name of our father be taken away from his family, because he had no son? Give to us a possession among our father's brethren.”
NUM.27.5	Moses brought their case before the 
NUM.27.6	And the 
NUM.27.7	“The daughters of Zelophehad are right; you shall give them possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren and cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.

NUM.27.13	And when you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as your brother Aaron was gathered, 
NUM.27.14	because you rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin during the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the waters before their eyes.” (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.) 
NUM.27.15	Moses said to the 
NUM.27.16	“Let the

NUM.27.20	You shall invest him with some of your authority, that all the congregation of the people of Israel may obey. 
NUM.27.21	And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before the

NUM.31.1	The 
NUM.31.2	“Avenge the people of Israel on the Midianites; afterward you shall be gathered to your people.” 
NUM.31.3	And Moses said to the people, “Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute the 
NUM.31.4	You shall send a thousand from each of the tribes of Israel to the war.” 
NUM.31.5	So there were provided, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand armed for war. 
NUM.31.6	And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand from each tribe, together with Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand. 
NUM.31.7	They warred against Midian, as the 
NUM.31.8	They slew the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian; and they also slew Balaam the son of Beor with the sword. 
NUM.31.9	And the people of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones; and they took as booty all their cattle, their flocks, and all their goods. 
NUM.31.10	All their cities in the places where they dwelt, and all their encampments, they burned with fire, 
NUM.31.11	and took all the spoil and all the booty, both of man and of beast. 
NUM.31.12	Then they brought the captives and the booty and the spoil to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the people of Israel, at the camp on the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
NUM.31.13	Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the congregation, went forth to meet them outside the camp. 
NUM.31.14	And Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, who had come from service in the war. 
NUM.31.15	Moses said to them, “Have you let all the women live? 
NUM.31.16	 Behold, these caused the people of Israel, by the counsel of Balaam, to act treacherously against the 
NUM.31.17	Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him. 
NUM.31.18	But all the young girls who have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.

NUM.31.20	You shall purify every garment, every article of skin, all work of goats' hair, and every article of wood.”
NUM.31.21	And Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had gone to battle: “This is the statute of the law which the 
NUM.31.22	only the gold, the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead, 
NUM.31.23	everything that can stand the fire, you shall pass through the fire, and it shall be clean. Nevertheless it shall also be purified with the water of impurity; and whatever cannot stand the fire, you shall pass through the water. 
NUM.31.24	You must wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean; and afterward you shall come into the camp.”
NUM.31.25	The 
NUM.31.26	“Take the count of the booty that was taken, both of man and of beast, you and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the fathers' houses of the congregation; 
NUM.31.27	and divide the booty into two parts, between the warriors who went out to battle and all the congregation. 
NUM.31.28	And levy for the 
NUM.31.29	take it from their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest as an offering to the 
NUM.31.30	And from the people of Israel's half you shall take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the oxen, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all the cattle, and give them to the Levites who have charge of the tabernacle of the 
NUM.31.31	And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the 
NUM.31.32	Now the booty remaining of the spoil that the men of war took was: six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep, 
NUM.31.33	seventy-two thousand cattle, 
NUM.31.34	sixty-one thousand asses, 
NUM.31.35	and thirty-two thousand persons in all, women who had not known man by lying with him. 
NUM.31.36	And the half, the portion of those who had gone out to war, was in number three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep, 
NUM.31.37	and the 
NUM.31.38	The cattle were thirty-six thousand, of which the 
NUM.31.39	The asses were thirty thousand five hundred, of which the 
NUM.31.40	The persons were sixteen thousand, of which the 
NUM.31.41	And Moses gave the tribute, which was the offering for the 
NUM.31.42	From the people of Israel's half, which Moses separated from that of the men who had gone to war— 
NUM.31.43	now the congregation's half was three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep, 
NUM.31.44	thirty-six thousand cattle, 
NUM.31.45	and thirty thousand five hundred asses, 
NUM.31.46	and sixteen thousand persons— 
NUM.31.47	from the people of Israel's half Moses took one of every fifty, both of persons and of beasts, and gave them to the Levites who had charge of the tabernacle of the 
NUM.31.48	Then the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, came near to Moses, 
NUM.31.49	and said to Moses, “Your servants have counted the men of war who are under our command, and there is not a man missing from us. 
NUM.31.50	And we have brought the 
NUM.31.51	And Moses and Eleazar the priest received from them the gold, all wrought articles. 
NUM.31.52	And all the gold of the offering that they offered to the 
NUM.31.53	(The men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.) 
NUM.31.54	And Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting, as a memorial for the people of Israel before the 
NUM.32.1	Now the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle; and they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, and behold, the place was a place for cattle. 
NUM.32.2	So the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben came and said to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the congregation, 
NUM.32.3	“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon, 
NUM.32.4	the land which the 
NUM.32.5	And they said, “If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession; do not take us across the Jordan.”
NUM.32.6	But Moses said to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben, “Shall your brethren go to the war while you sit here? 
NUM.32.7	Why will you discourage the heart of the people of Israel from going over into the land which the 
NUM.32.8	Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land. 
NUM.32.9	For when they went up to the Valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the people of Israel from going into the land which the 
NUM.32.10	And the 
NUM.32.11	‘Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, because they have not wholly followed me; 
NUM.32.12	none except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua the son of Nun, for they have wholly followed the 
NUM.32.13	And the 
NUM.32.14	And behold, you have risen in your fathers' stead, a brood of sinful men, to increase still more the fierce anger of the 
NUM.32.15	For if you turn away from following him, he will again abandon them in the wilderness; and you will destroy all this people.”
NUM.32.16	Then they came near to him, and said, “We will build sheepfolds here for our flocks, and cities for our little ones, 
NUM.32.17	but we will take up arms, ready to go before the people of Israel, until we have brought them to their place; and our little ones shall live in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land. 
NUM.32.18	We will not return to our homes until the people of Israel have inherited each his inheritance. 
NUM.32.19	For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond; because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the Jordan to the east.” 
NUM.32.20	So Moses said to them, “If you will do this, if you will take up arms to go before the 
NUM.32.21	and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before the 
NUM.32.22	and the land is subdued before the 
NUM.32.23	But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against the 
NUM.32.24	Build cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do what you have promised.” 
NUM.32.25	And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben said to Moses, “Your servants will do as my lord commands. 
NUM.32.26	Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall remain there in the cities of Gilead; 
NUM.32.27	but your servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war, before the 
NUM.32.28	So Moses gave command concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the people of Israel. 
NUM.32.29	And Moses said to them, “If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben, every man who is armed to battle before the 
NUM.32.30	but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.” 
NUM.32.31	And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answered, “As the 
NUM.32.32	We will pass over armed before the 
NUM.32.33	And Moses gave to them, to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land and its cities with their territories, the cities of the land throughout the country. 
NUM.32.34	And the sons of Gad built Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, 
NUM.32.35	Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, 
NUM.32.36	Beth-nimrah and Beth-haran, fortified cities, and folds for sheep. 
NUM.32.37	And the sons of Reuben built Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, 
NUM.32.38	Nebo, and Baal-meon (their names to be changed), and Sibmah; and they gave other names to the cities which they built. 
NUM.32.39	And the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it. 
NUM.32.40	And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he settled in it. 
NUM.32.41	And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took their villages, and called them Havvoth-jair.
NUM.32.42	And Nobah went and took Kenath and its villages, and called it Nobah, after his own name.

NUM.36.1	The heads of the fathers' houses of the families of the sons of Gilead the son of Machir, son of Manasseh, of the fathers' houses of the sons of Joseph, came near and spoke before Moses and before the leaders, the heads of the fathers' houses of the people of Israel; 
NUM.36.2	they said, “The 
NUM.36.3	But if they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the people of Israel then their inheritance will be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; so it will be taken away from the lot of our inheritance. 
NUM.36.4	And when the jubilee of the people of Israel comes, then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; and their inheritance will be taken from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.”
NUM.36.5	And Moses commanded the people of Israel according to the word of the 
NUM.36.6	This is what the 
NUM.36.7	The inheritance of the people of Israel shall not be transferred from one tribe to another; for every one of the people of Israel shall cleave to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. 
NUM.36.8	And every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the people of Israel shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, so that every one of the people of Israel may possess the inheritance of his fathers. 
NUM.36.9	So no inheritance shall be transferred from one tribe to another; for each of the tribes of the people of Israel shall cleave to its own inheritance.’ ”
NUM.36.10	The daughters of Zelophehad did as the 
NUM.36.11	for Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to sons of their father's brothers. 
NUM.36.12	They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
NUM.36.13	These are the commandments and the ordinances which the 
DEU.1.1	These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah over against Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab. 
DEU.1.2	It is eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea. 
DEU.1.3	And in the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the people of Israel according to all that the 
DEU.1.4	after he had defeated Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth and in Edre-i. 
DEU.1.5	Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to explain this law, saying, 
DEU.1.6	“The 
DEU.1.7	turn and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites, and to all their neighbors in the Arabah, in the hill country and in the lowland, and in the Negeb, and by the seacoast, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates. 
DEU.1.8	Behold, I have set the land before you; go in and take possession of the land which the 
DEU.1.10	the 
DEU.1.11	May the 
DEU.1.12	How can I bear alone the weight and burden of you and your strife? 
DEU.1.13	Choose wise, understanding, and experienced men, according to your tribes, and I will appoint them as your heads.’ 
DEU.1.14	And you answered me, ‘The thing that you have spoken is good for us to do.’ 
DEU.1.15	So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and experienced men, and set them as heads over you, commanders of thousands, commanders of hundreds, commanders of fifties, commanders of tens, and officers, throughout your tribes. 
DEU.1.16	 And I charged your judges at that time, ‘Hear the cases between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother or the alien that is with him. 
DEU.1.17	You shall not be partial in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike; you shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is God's; and the case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.’ 
DEU.1.18	And I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do.
DEU.1.19	“And we set out from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as the 
DEU.1.20	And I said to you, ‘You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which the 
DEU.1.21	Behold, the 
DEU.1.22	 Then all of you came near me, and said, ‘Let us send men before us, that they may explore the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up and the cities into which we shall come.’ 
DEU.1.23	The thing seemed good to me, and I took twelve men of you, one man for each tribe; 
DEU.1.24	and they turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshcol and spied it out. 
DEU.1.25	And they took in their hands some of the fruit of the land and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, ‘It is a good land which the 
DEU.1.26	“Yet you would not go up, but rebelled against the command of the 
DEU.1.27	and you murmured in your tents, and said, ‘Because the 
DEU.1.28	Whither are we going up? Our brethren have made our hearts melt, saying, “The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.” ’ 
DEU.1.29	Then I said to you, ‘Do not be in dread or afraid of them. 
DEU.1.30	The 
DEU.1.31	 and in the wilderness, where you have seen how the 
DEU.1.32	Yet in spite of this word you did not believe the 
DEU.1.33	who went before you in the way to seek you out a place to pitch your tents, in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day.
DEU.1.34	“And the 
DEU.1.35	‘Not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land which I swore to give to your fathers, 
DEU.1.36	except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him and to his children I will give the land upon which he has trodden, because he has wholly followed the 
DEU.1.37	The 
DEU.1.38	Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall enter; encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. 
DEU.1.39	Moreover your little ones, who you said would become a prey, and your children, who this day have no knowledge of good or evil, shall go in there, and to them I will give it, and they shall possess it. 
DEU.1.40	But as for you, turn, and journey into the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea.’
DEU.1.41	“Then you answered me, ‘We have sinned against the 
DEU.1.42	And the 
DEU.1.43	So I spoke to you, and you would not hearken; but you rebelled against the command of the 
DEU.1.44	Then the Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you and chased you as bees do and beat you down in Seir as far as Hormah. 
DEU.1.45	And you returned and wept before the 
DEU.1.46	So you remained at Kadesh many days, the days that you remained there.
DEU.2.2	Then the 
DEU.2.3	‘You have been going about this mountain country long enough; turn northward. 
DEU.2.4	And command the people, You are about to pass through the territory of your brethren the sons of Esau, who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. So take good heed; 
DEU.2.5	do not contend with them; for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession. 
DEU.2.6	You shall purchase food from them for money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy water of them for money, that you may drink. 
DEU.2.7	For the 
DEU.2.8	So we went on, away from our brethren the sons of Esau who live in Seir, away from the Arabah road from Elath and Ezion-geber.
DEU.2.8	“And we turned and went in the direction of the wilderness of Moab. 
DEU.2.9	And the 
DEU.2.10	(The Emim formerly lived there, a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim; 
DEU.2.11	like the Anakim they are also known as Rephaim, but the Moabites call them Emim. 
DEU.2.12	The Horites also lived in Seir formerly, but the sons of Esau dispossessed them, and destroyed them from before them, and settled in their stead; as Israel did to the land of their possession, which the 
DEU.2.13	‘Now rise up, and go over the brook Zered.’ So we went over the brook Zered. 
DEU.2.14	And the time from our leaving Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the brook Zered was thirty-eight years, until the entire generation, that is, the men of war, had perished from the camp, as the 
DEU.2.15	For indeed the hand of the 
DEU.2.16	“So when all the men of war had perished and were dead from among the people, 
DEU.2.17	the 
DEU.2.18	‘This day you are to pass over the boundary of Moab at Ar; 
DEU.2.19	and when you approach the frontier of the sons of Ammon, do not harass them or contend with them, for I will not give you any of the land of the sons of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot for a possession.’ 
DEU.2.20	(That also is known as a land of Rephaim; Rephaim formerly lived there, but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim, 
DEU.2.21	a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim; but the 
DEU.2.22	as he did for the sons of Esau, who live in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites before them, and they dispossessed them, and settled in their stead even to this day. 
DEU.2.23	As for the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and settled in their stead.) 
DEU.2.24	‘Rise up, take your journey, and go over the valley of the Arnon; behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to take possession, and contend with him in battle. 
DEU.2.25	This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of you and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.’
DEU.2.27	‘Let me pass through your land; I will go only by the road, I will turn aside neither to the right nor to the left. 
DEU.2.28	You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat, and give me water for money, that I may drink; only let me pass through on foot, 
DEU.2.29	as the sons of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me, until I go over the Jordan into the land which the 
DEU.2.30	But Sihon the king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for the 
DEU.2.31	And the 
DEU.2.32	Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz. 
DEU.2.33	And the 
DEU.2.34	And we captured all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed every city, men, women, and children; we left none remaining; 
DEU.2.35	only the cattle we took as spoil for ourselves, with the booty of the cities which we captured. 
DEU.2.36	From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and from the city that is in the valley, as far as Gilead, there was not a city too high for us; the 
DEU.2.37	Only to the land of the sons of Ammon you did not draw near, that is, to all the banks of the river Jabbok and the cities of the hill country, and wherever the 
DEU.3.2	But the 
DEU.3.3	So the 
DEU.3.4	And we took all his cities at that time—there was not a city which we did not take from them—sixty cities, the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
DEU.3.5	All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides very many unwalled villages. 
DEU.3.6	And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon the king of Heshbon, destroying every city, men, women, and children. 
DEU.3.7	But all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we took as our booty. 
DEU.3.8	So we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon 
DEU.3.9	(the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, while the Amorites call it Senir), 
DEU.3.10	all the cities of the tableland and all Gilead and all Bashan, as far as Salecah and Edre-i, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
DEU.3.11	(For only Og the king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the Ammonites? Nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its breadth, according to the common cubit.
DEU.3.13	the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, that is, all the region of Argob, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (The whole of that Bashan is called the land of Rephaim. 
DEU.3.14	Jair the Manassite took all the region of Argob, that is, Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Ma-acathites, and called the villages after his own name, Havvoth-jair, as it is to this day.) 
DEU.3.15	To Machir I gave Gilead, 
DEU.3.16	and to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead as far as the valley of the Arnon, with the middle of the valley as a boundary, as far over as the river Jabbok, the boundary of the Ammonites; 
DEU.3.17	the Arabah also, with the Jordan as the boundary, from Chinnereth as far as the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah on the east.
DEU.3.18	“And I commanded you at that time, saying, ‘The 
DEU.3.19	But your wives, your little ones, and your cattle (I know that you have many cattle) shall remain in the cities which I have given you, 
DEU.3.20	until the 
DEU.3.21	And I commanded Joshua at that time, ‘Your eyes have seen all that the 
DEU.3.22	You shall not fear them; for it is the 
DEU.3.24	‘O Lord 
DEU.3.25	Let me go over, I pray, and see the good land beyond the Jordan, that goodly hill country, and Lebanon.’ 
DEU.3.26	But the 
DEU.3.27	Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward, and behold it with your eyes; for you shall not go over this Jordan. 
DEU.3.28	But charge Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him; for he shall go over at the head of this people, and he shall put them in possession of the land which you shall see.’ 
DEU.3.29	So we remained in the valley opposite Beth-peor.
DEU.4.1	“And now, O Israel, give heed to the statutes and the ordinances which I teach you, and do them; that you may live, and go in and take possession of the land which the 
DEU.4.2	 You shall not add to the word which I command you, nor take from it; that you may keep the commandments of the 
DEU.4.3	Your eyes have seen what the 
DEU.4.4	but you who held fast to the 
DEU.4.5	Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, as the 
DEU.4.6	Keep them and do them; for that will be your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, who, when they hear all these statutes, will say, ‘Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.’ 
DEU.4.7	For what great nation is there that has a god so near to it as the 
DEU.4.8	And what great nation is there, that has statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law which I set before you this day?
DEU.4.10	how on the day that you stood before the 
DEU.4.11	And you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, while the mountain burned with fire to the heart of heaven, wrapped in darkness, cloud, and gloom. 
DEU.4.12	Then the 
DEU.4.13	And he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, that is, the ten commandments;
DEU.4.14	And the 
DEU.4.15	“Therefore take good heed to yourselves. Since you saw no form on the day that the 
DEU.4.16	beware lest you act corruptly by making a graven image for yourselves, in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female, 
DEU.4.17	the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the air, 
DEU.4.18	the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth. 
DEU.4.19	And beware lest you lift up your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of heaven, you be drawn away and worship them and serve them, things which the 
DEU.4.20	But the 
DEU.4.21	Furthermore the 
DEU.4.22	For I must die in this land, I must not go over the Jordan; but you shall go over and take possession of that good land. 
DEU.4.23	Take heed to yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of the 
DEU.4.24	 For the 
DEU.4.25	“When you beget children and children's children, and have grown old in the land, if you act corruptly by making a graven image in the form of anything, and by doing what is evil in the sight of the 
DEU.4.26	I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that you will soon utterly perish from the land which you are going over the Jordan to possess; you will not live long upon it, but will be utterly destroyed. 
DEU.4.27	And the 
DEU.4.28	And there you will serve gods of wood and stone, the work of men's hands, that neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. 
DEU.4.29	But from there you will seek the 
DEU.4.30	When you are in tribulation, and all these things come upon you in the latter days, you will return to the 
DEU.4.31	for the 
DEU.4.32	“For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from one end of heaven to the other, whether such a great thing as this has ever happened or was ever heard of. 
DEU.4.33	Did any people ever hear the voice of a god speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and still live? 
DEU.4.34	Or has any god ever attempted to go and take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, and by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the 
DEU.4.35	 To you it was shown, that you might know that the 
DEU.4.36	Out of heaven he let you hear his voice, that he might discipline you; and on earth he let you see his great fire, and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire. 
DEU.4.37	And because he loved your fathers and chose their descendants after them, and brought you out of Egypt with his own presence, by his great power, 
DEU.4.38	driving out before you nations greater and mightier than yourselves, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as at this day; 
DEU.4.39	know therefore this day, and lay it to your heart, that the 
DEU.4.40	Therefore you shall keep his statutes and his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which the 
DEU.4.42	that the manslayer might flee there, who kills his neighbor unintentionally, without being at enmity with him in time past, and that by fleeing to one of these cities he might save his life: 
DEU.4.43	Bezer in the wilderness on the tableland for the Reubenites, and Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites.
DEU.4.44	This is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel; 
DEU.4.45	these are the testimonies, the statutes, and the ordinances, which Moses spoke to the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt, 
DEU.4.46	beyond the Jordan in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel defeated when they came out of Egypt. 
DEU.4.47	And they took possession of his land and the land of Og the king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who lived to the east beyond the Jordan; 
DEU.4.48	from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, as far as Mount Sirion
DEU.4.49	together with all the Arabah on the east side of the Jordan as far as the Sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.
DEU.5.1	And Moses summoned all Israel, and said to them, “Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your hearing this day, and you shall learn them and be careful to do them. 
DEU.5.2	The 
DEU.5.3	Not with our fathers did the 
DEU.5.4	The 
DEU.5.5	while I stood between the 
DEU.5.7	“ ‘You shall have no other gods before

DEU.9.2	a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you have heard it said, ‘Who can stand before the sons of Anak?’ 
DEU.9.3	 Know therefore this day that he who goes over before you as a devouring fire is the 
DEU.9.4	“Do not say in your heart, after the

DEU.9.6	“Know therefore, that the 
DEU.9.7	Remember and do not forget how you provoked the 
DEU.9.8	 Even at Horeb you provoked the 
DEU.9.9	When I went up the mountain to receive the tables of stone, the tables of the covenant which the 
DEU.9.10	And the 
DEU.9.11	And at the end of forty days and forty nights the 
DEU.9.12	Then the 
DEU.9.13	“Furthermore the 
DEU.9.14	let me alone, that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.’ 
DEU.9.15	So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire; and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands. 
DEU.9.16	And I looked, and behold, you had sinned against the 
DEU.9.17	So I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes. 
DEU.9.18	Then I lay prostrate before the 
DEU.9.19	For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure which the 
DEU.9.20	And the 
DEU.9.21	Then I took the sinful thing, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire and crushed it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust; and I threw the dust of it into the brook that descended out of the mountain.
DEU.9.22	“At Taberah also, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, you provoked the 
DEU.9.23	And when the 
DEU.9.24	You have been rebellious against the 
DEU.9.26	And I prayed to the 
DEU.9.27	Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not regard the stubbornness of this people, or their wickedness, or their sin, 
DEU.9.28	lest the land from which thou didst bring us say, “Because the 
DEU.9.29	For they are thy people and thy heritage, whom thou didst bring out by thy great power and by thy outstretched arm.’
DEU.10.1	“At that time the 
DEU.10.2	And I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.’ 
DEU.10.3	So I made an ark of acacia wood, and hewed two tables of stone like the first, and went up the mountain with the two tables in my hand. 
DEU.10.4	And he wrote on the tables, as at the first writing, the ten commandments
DEU.10.5	Then I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are, as the 
DEU.10.6	(The people of Israel journeyed from Be-eroth Bene-jaakan
DEU.10.7	From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land with brooks of water. 
DEU.10.8	At that time the 
DEU.10.9	Therefore Levi has no portion or inheritance with his brothers; the

DEU.10.15	yet the

DEU.10.18	He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing. 
DEU.10.19	 Love the sojourner therefore; for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt. 
DEU.10.20	You shall fear the 
DEU.10.21	He is your praise; he is your God, who has done for you these great and terrible things which your eyes have seen.

DEU.11.4	and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the 
DEU.11.5	and what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came to this place; 
DEU.11.6	and what he did to Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, son of Reuben; how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households, their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel;

DEU.11.8	“You shall therefore keep all the commandment which I command you this day, that you may be strong, and go in and take possession of the land which you are going over to possess, 
DEU.11.9	and that you may live long in the land which the 
DEU.11.10	For the land which you are entering to take possession of it is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you sowed your seed and watered it with your feet, like a garden of vegetables; 
DEU.11.11	but the land which you are going over to possess is a land of hills and valleys, which drinks water by the rain from heaven, 
DEU.11.12	a land which the

DEU.12.2	You shall surely destroy all the places where the nations whom you shall dispossess served their gods, upon the high mountains and upon the hills and under every green tree; 
DEU.12.3	you shall tear down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and burn their Asherim with fire; you shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy their name out of that place. 
DEU.12.4	You shall not do so to the 
DEU.12.5	But you shall seek the place which the 
DEU.12.6	and thither you shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and the offering that you present, your votive offerings, your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock; 
DEU.12.7	and there you shall eat before the 
DEU.12.8	You shall not do according to all that we are doing here this day, every man doing whatever is right in his own eyes;

DEU.12.31	You shall not do so to the 
DEU.13.1	“If a prophet arises among you, or a dreamer of dreams, and gives you a sign or a wonder,

DEU.13.15	you shall surely put the inhabitants of that city to the sword, destroying it utterly, all who are in it and its cattle, with the edge of the sword.

DEU.15.1	“At the end of every seven years you shall grant a release. 
DEU.15.2	And this is the manner of the release: every creditor shall release what he has lent to his neighbor; he shall not exact it of his neighbor, his brother, because the 
DEU.15.3	Of a foreigner you may exact it; but whatever of yours is with your brother your hand shall release.

DEU.15.10	You shall give to him freely, and your heart shall not be grudging when you give to him; because for this the 
DEU.15.11	For the poor will never cease out of the land; therefore I command you, You shall open wide your hand to your brother, to the needy and to the poor, in the land.
DEU.15.13	And when you let him go free from you, you shall not let him go empty-handed; 
DEU.15.14	you shall furnish him liberally out of your flock, out of your threshing floor, and out of your wine press; as the 
DEU.15.15	You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the 
DEU.15.16	But if he says to you, ‘I will not go out from you,’ because he loves you and your household, since he fares well with you, 
DEU.15.17	then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear into the door, and he shall be your bondman for ever. And to your bondwoman you shall do likewise. 
DEU.15.18	It shall not seem hard to you, when you let him go free from you; for at half the cost of a hired servant he has served you six years. So the

DEU.15.21	But if it has any blemish, if it is lame or blind, or has any serious blemish whatever, you shall not sacrifice it to the 
DEU.15.22	You shall eat it within your towns; the unclean and the clean alike may eat it, as though it were a gazelle or a hart.

DEU.16.4	No leaven shall be seen with you in all your territory for seven days; nor shall any of the flesh which you sacrifice on the evening of the first day remain all night until morning.

DEU.17.3	and has gone and served other gods and worshiped them, or the sun or the moon or any of the host of heaven, which I have forbidden, 
DEU.17.4	and it is told you and you hear of it; then you shall inquire diligently, and if it is true and certain that such an abominable thing has been done in Israel, 
DEU.17.5	then you shall bring forth to your gates that man or woman who has done this evil thing, and you shall stone that man or woman to death with stones.

DEU.17.9	and coming to the Levitical priests, and to the judge who is in office in those days, you shall consult them, and they shall declare to you the decision. 
DEU.17.10	Then you shall do according to what they declare to you from that place which the 
DEU.17.11	according to the instructions which they give you, and according to the decision which they pronounce to you, you shall do; you shall not turn aside from the verdict which they declare to you, either to the right hand or to the left.

DEU.18.13	 You shall be blameless before the 
DEU.18.14	For these nations, which you are about to dispossess, give heed to soothsayers and to diviners; but as for you, the 
DEU.18.16	just as you desired of the 
DEU.18.17	And the 
DEU.18.18	I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brethren; and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him. 
DEU.18.19	And whoever will not give heed to my words which he shall speak in my name, I myself will require it of him. 
DEU.18.20	But the prophet who presumes to speak a word in my name which I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.’ 
DEU.18.21	And if you say in your heart, ‘How may we know the word which the 
DEU.18.22	when a prophet speaks in the name of the

DEU.19.6	lest the avenger of blood in hot anger pursue the manslayer and overtake him, because the way is long, and wound him mortally, though the man did not deserve to die, since he was not at enmity with his neighbor in time past. 
DEU.19.7	Therefore I command you, You shall set apart three cities. 
DEU.19.8	And if the 
DEU.19.9	provided you are careful to keep all this commandment, which I command you this day, by loving the 
DEU.19.10	lest innocent blood be shed in your land which the

DEU.19.20	And the rest shall hear, and fear, and shall never again commit any such evil among you. 
DEU.19.21	 Your eye shall not pity; it shall be life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
DEU.20.1	“When you go forth to war against your enemies, and see horses and chariots and an army larger than your own, you shall not be afraid of them; for the 
DEU.20.2	And when you draw near to the battle, the priest shall come forward and speak to the people, 
DEU.20.3	and shall say to them, ‘Hear, O Israel, you draw near this day to battle against your enemies: let not your heart faint; do not fear, or tremble, or be in dread of them; 
DEU.20.4	for the 
DEU.20.5	Then the officers shall speak to the people, saying, ‘What man is there that has built a new house and has not dedicated it? Let him go back to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man dedicate it. 
DEU.20.6	And what man is there that has planted a vineyard and has not enjoyed its fruit? Let him go back to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man enjoy its fruit. 
DEU.20.7	And what man is there that has betrothed a wife and has not taken her? Let him go back to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man take her.’ 
DEU.20.8	And the officers shall speak further to the people, and say, ‘What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? Let him go back to his house, lest the heart of his fellows melt as his heart.’ 
DEU.20.9	And when the officers have make an end of speaking to the people, then commanders shall be appointed at the head of the people.
DEU.20.10	“When you draw near to a city to fight against it, offer terms of peace to it. 
DEU.20.11	And if its answer to you is peace and it opens to you, then all the people who are found in it shall do forced labor for you and shall serve you. 
DEU.20.12	But if it makes no peace with you, but makes war against you, then you shall besiege it; 
DEU.20.13	and when the 
DEU.20.14	but the women and the little ones, the cattle, and everything else in the city, all its spoil, you shall take as booty for yourselves; and you shall enjoy the spoil of your enemies, which the 
DEU.20.15	Thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far from you, which are not cities of the nations here. 
DEU.20.16	But in the cities of these peoples that the 
DEU.20.17	but you shall utterly destroy them, the Hittites and the Amorites, the Canaanites and the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, as the 
DEU.20.18	that they may not teach you to do according to all their abominable practices which they have done in the service of their gods, and so to sin against the 
DEU.20.19	“When you besiege a city for a long time, making war against it in order to take it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an axe against them; for you may eat of them, but you shall not cut them down. Are the trees in the field men that they should be besieged by you? 
DEU.20.20	Only the trees which you know are not trees for food you may destroy and cut down that you may build siegeworks against the city that makes war with you, until it falls.

DEU.21.4	And the elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley. 
DEU.21.5	And the priests the sons of Levi shall come forward, for the 
DEU.21.6	And all the elders of that city nearest to the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley; 
DEU.21.7	and they shall testify, ‘Our hands did not shed this blood, neither did our eyes see it shed. 
DEU.21.8	Forgive, O 
DEU.21.9	So you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood from your midst, when you do what is right in the sight of the 
DEU.21.10	“When you go forth to war against your enemies, and the 
DEU.21.11	and see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you have desire for her and would take her for yourself as wife, 
DEU.21.12	then you shall bring her home to your house, and she shall shave her head and pare her nails. 
DEU.21.13	And she shall put off her captive's garb, and shall remain in your house and bewail her father and her mother a full month; after that you may go in to her, and be her husband, and she shall be your wife. 
DEU.21.14	Then, if you have no delight in her, you shall let her go where she will; but you shall not sell her for money, you shall not treat her as a slave, since you have humiliated her.
DEU.21.15	“If a man has two wives, the one loved and the other disliked, and they have borne him children, both the loved and the disliked, and if the first-born son is hers that is disliked, 
DEU.21.16	then on the day when he assigns his possessions as an inheritance to his sons, he may not treat the son of the loved as the first-born in preference to the son of the disliked, who is the first-born, 
DEU.21.17	but he shall acknowledge the first-born, the son of the disliked, by giving him a double portion of all that he has, for he is the first issue of his strength; the right of the first-born is his.
DEU.21.19	then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city at the gate of the place where he lives, 
DEU.21.20	and they shall say to the elders of his city, ‘This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard.’

DEU.22.3	And so you shall do with his ass; so you shall do with his garment; so you shall do with any lost thing of your brother's, which he loses and you find; you may not withhold your help. 
DEU.22.4	You shall not see your brother's ass or his ox fallen down by the way, and withhold your help
DEU.22.5	“A woman shall not wear anything that pertains to a man, nor shall a man put on a woman's garment; for whoever does these things is an abomination to the

DEU.22.14	and charges her with shameful conduct, and brings an evil name upon her, saying, ‘I took this woman, and when I came near her, I did not find in her the tokens of virginity,’ 
DEU.22.15	then the father of the young woman and her mother shall take and bring out the tokens of her virginity to the elders of the city in the gate; 
DEU.22.16	and the father of the young woman shall say to the elders, ‘I gave my daughter to this man to wife, and he spurns her; 
DEU.22.17	and lo, he has made shameful charges against her, saying, “I did not find in your daughter the tokens of virginity.” And yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity.’ And they shall spread the garment before the elders of the city. 
DEU.22.18	Then the elders of that city shall take the man and whip him; 
DEU.22.19	and they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver, and give them to the father of the young woman, because he has brought an evil name upon a virgin of Israel; and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days. 
DEU.22.20	But if the thing is true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the young woman, 
DEU.22.21	 then they shall bring out the young woman to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones, because she has wrought folly in Israel by playing the harlot in her father's house; so you shall purge the evil from the midst of you.
DEU.22.23	“If there is a betrothed virgin, and a man meets her in the city and lies with her, 
DEU.22.24	 then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones, the young woman because she did not cry for help though she was in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbor's wife; so you shall purge the evil from the midst of you.
DEU.22.25	“But if in the open country a man meets a young woman who is betrothed, and the man seizes her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her shall die. 
DEU.22.26	But to the young woman you shall do nothing; in the young woman there is no offense punishable by death, for this case is like that of a man attacking and murdering his neighbor; 
DEU.22.27	because he came upon her in the open country, and though the betrothed young woman cried for help there was no one to rescue her.
DEU.22.29	then the man who lay with her shall give to the father of the young woman fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife, because he has violated her; he may not put her away all his days.

DEU.23.25	When you go into your neighbor's standing grain, you may pluck the ears with your hand, but you shall not put a sickle to your neighbor's standing grain.
DEU.24.2	and if she goes and becomes another man's wife, 
DEU.24.3	and the latter husband dislikes her and writes her a bill of divorce and puts it in her hand and sends her out of his house, or if the latter husband dies, who took her to be his wife, 
DEU.24.4	then her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after she has been defiled; for that is an abomination before the 
DEU.24.5	“When a man is newly married, he shall not go out with the army or be charged with any business; he shall be free at home one year, to be happy with his wife whom he has taken.

DEU.27.4	And when you have passed over the Jordan, you shall set up these stones, concerning which I command you this day, on Mount Ebal, and you shall plaster them with plaster. 
DEU.27.5	And there you shall build an altar to the 
DEU.27.6	You shall build an altar to the 
DEU.27.7	and you shall sacrifice peace offerings, and shall eat there; and you shall rejoice before the 
DEU.27.8	And you shall write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly.”
DEU.27.9	And Moses and the Levitical priests said to all Israel, “Keep silence and hear, O Israel: this day you have become the people of the 
DEU.27.10	You shall therefore obey the voice of the 
DEU.27.11	And Moses charged the people the same day, saying, 
DEU.27.12	“When you have passed over the Jordan, these shall stand upon Mount Gerizim to bless the people: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin. 
DEU.27.13	And these shall stand upon Mount Ebal for the curse: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali. 
DEU.27.14	And the Levites shall declare to all the men of Israel with a loud voice:
DEU.27.17	“ ‘Cursed be he who removes his neighbor's landmark.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
DEU.27.24	“ ‘Cursed be he who slays his neighbor in secret.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
DEU.27.25	“ ‘Cursed be he who takes a bribe to slay an innocent person.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
DEU.28.2	And all these blessings shall come upon you and overtake you, if you obey the voice of the 
DEU.28.3	Blessed shall you be in the city, and blessed shall you be in the field. 
DEU.28.4	Blessed shall be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your ground, and the fruit of your beasts, the increase of your cattle, and the young of your flock. 
DEU.28.5	Blessed shall be your basket and your kneading-trough. 
DEU.28.6	Blessed shall you be when you come in, and blessed shall you be when you go out.
DEU.28.7	“The 
DEU.28.8	The 
DEU.28.9	The 
DEU.28.10	And all the peoples of the earth shall see that you are called by the name of the 
DEU.28.11	And the 
DEU.28.12	The 
DEU.28.13	And the 
DEU.28.14	and if you do not turn aside from any of the words which I command you this day, to the right hand or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.
DEU.28.15	“But if you will not obey the voice of the 
DEU.28.16	Cursed shall you be in the city, and cursed shall you be in the field. 
DEU.28.17	Cursed shall be your basket and your kneading-trough. 
DEU.28.18	Cursed shall be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your ground, the increase of your cattle, and the young of your flock. 
DEU.28.19	Cursed shall you be when you come in, and cursed shall you be when you go out.
DEU.28.20	“The 
DEU.28.21	The 
DEU.28.22	The 
DEU.28.23	And the heavens over your head shall be brass, and the earth under you shall be iron. 
DEU.28.24	The 
DEU.28.25	“The 
DEU.28.26	And your dead body shall be food for all birds of the air, and for the beasts of the earth; and there shall be no one to frighten them away. 
DEU.28.27	The 
DEU.28.28	The 
DEU.28.29	and you shall grope at noonday, as the blind grope in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways; and you shall be only oppressed and robbed continually, and there shall be no one to help you. 
DEU.28.30	You shall betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her; you shall build a house, and you shall not dwell in it; you shall plant a vineyard, and you shall not use the fruit of it. 
DEU.28.31	Your ox shall be slain before your eyes, and you shall not eat of it; your ass shall be violently taken away before your face, and shall not be restored to you; your sheep shall be given to your enemies, and there shall be no one to help you. 
DEU.28.32	Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people, while your eyes look on and fail with longing for them all the day; and it shall not be in the power of your hand to prevent it. 
DEU.28.33	A nation which you have not known shall eat up the fruit of your ground and of all your labors; and you shall be only oppressed and crushed continually; 
DEU.28.34	so that you shall be driven mad by the sight which your eyes shall see. 
DEU.28.35	The 
DEU.28.36	“The 
DEU.28.37	And you shall become a horror, a proverb, and a byword, among all the peoples where the 
DEU.28.38	You shall carry much seed into the field, and shall gather little in; for the locust shall consume it. 
DEU.28.39	You shall plant vineyards and dress them, but you shall neither drink of the wine nor gather the grapes; for the worm shall eat them. 
DEU.28.40	You shall have olive trees throughout all your territory, but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil; for your olives shall drop off. 
DEU.28.41	You shall beget sons and daughters, but they shall not be yours; for they shall go into captivity. 
DEU.28.42	All your trees and the fruit of your ground the locust shall possess. 
DEU.28.43	The sojourner who is among you shall mount above you higher and higher; and you shall come down lower and lower. 
DEU.28.44	He shall lend to you, and you shall now lend to him; he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail. 
DEU.28.45	All these curses shall come upon you and pursue you and overtake you, till you are destroyed, because you did not obey the voice of the 
DEU.28.46	They shall be upon you as a sign and a wonder, and upon your descendants for ever.
DEU.28.47	“Because you did not serve the 
DEU.28.48	therefore you shall serve your enemies whom the 
DEU.28.49	 The 
DEU.28.50	a nation of stern countenance, who shall not regard the person of the old or show favor to the young, 
DEU.28.51	and shall eat the offspring of your cattle and the fruit of your ground, until you are destroyed; who also shall not leave you grain, wine, or oil, the increase of your cattle or the young of your flock, until they have caused you to perish. 
DEU.28.52	They shall besiege you in all your towns, until your high and fortified walls, in which you trusted, come down throughout all your land; and they shall besiege you in all your towns throughout all your land, which the 
DEU.28.53	And you shall eat the offspring of your own body, the flesh of your sons and daughters, whom the 
DEU.28.54	The man who is the most tender and delicately bred among you will grudge food to his brother, to the wife of his bosom, and to the last of the children who remain to him; 
DEU.28.55	so that he will not give to any of them any of the flesh of his children whom he is eating, because he has nothing left him, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in all your towns. 
DEU.28.56	The most tender and delicately bred woman among you, who would not venture to set the sole of her foot upon the ground because she is so delicate and tender, will grudge to the husband of her bosom, to her son and to her daughter, 
DEU.28.57	her afterbirth that comes out from between her feet and her children whom she bears, because she will eat them secretly, for want of all things, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in your towns.
DEU.28.58	“If you are not careful to do all the words of this law which are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and awful name, the 
DEU.28.59	then the 
DEU.28.60	And he will bring upon you again all the diseases of Egypt, which you were afraid of; and they shall cleave to you. 
DEU.28.61	Every sickness also, and every affliction which is not recorded in the book of this law, the 
DEU.28.62	Whereas you were as the stars of heaven for multitude, you shall be left few in number; because you did not obey the voice of the 
DEU.28.63	And as the 
DEU.28.64	And the 
DEU.28.65	And among these nations you shall find no ease, and there shall be no rest for the sole of your foot; but the 
DEU.28.66	your life shall hang in doubt before you; night and day you shall be in dread, and have no assurance of your life. 
DEU.28.67	In the morning you shall say, ‘Would it were evening!’ and at evening you shall say, ‘Would it were morning!’ because of the dread which your heart shall fear, and the sights which your eyes shall see. 
DEU.28.68	And the 
DEU.29.3	the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders; 
DEU.29.4	 but to this day the 
DEU.29.5	I have led you forty years in the wilderness; your clothes have not worn out upon you, and your sandals have not worn off your feet; 
DEU.29.6	you have not eaten bread, and you have not drunk wine or strong drink; that you may know that I am the 
DEU.29.7	And when you came to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of Bashan came out against us to battle, but we defeated them; 
DEU.29.8	we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Manassites. 
DEU.29.9	Therefore be careful to do the words of this covenant, that you may prosper
DEU.29.10	“You stand this day all of you before the 
DEU.29.11	your little ones, your wives, and the sojourner who is in your camp, both he who hews your wood and he who draws your water, 
DEU.29.12	that you may enter into the sworn covenant of the 
DEU.29.13	that he may establish you this day as his people, and that he may be your God, as he promised you, and as he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 
DEU.29.14	Nor is it with you only that I make this sworn covenant, 
DEU.29.15	but with him who is not here with us this day as well as with him who stands here with us this day before the 
DEU.29.16	“You know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the midst of the nations through which you passed; 
DEU.29.17	and you have seen their detestable things, their idols of wood and stone, of silver and gold, which were among them. 
DEU.29.18	 Beware lest there be among you a man or woman or family or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from the 
DEU.29.19	one who, when he hears the words of this sworn covenant, blesses himself in his heart, saying, ‘I shall be safe, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart.’ This would lead to the sweeping away of moist and dry alike. 
DEU.29.20	The 
DEU.29.21	And the 
DEU.29.22	And the generation to come, your children who rise up after you, and the foreigner who comes from a far land, would say, when they see the afflictions of that land and the sicknesses with which the 
DEU.29.23	the whole land brimstone and salt, and a burnt-out waste, unsown, and growing nothing, where no grass can sprout, an overthrow like that of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the 
DEU.29.24	yea, all the nations would say, ‘Why has the 
DEU.29.25	Then men would say, ‘It is because they forsook the covenant of the 
DEU.29.26	and went and served other gods and worshiped them, gods whom they had not known and whom he had not allotted to them; 
DEU.29.27	therefore the anger of the 
DEU.29.28	and the 
DEU.29.29	“The secret things belong to the 
DEU.30.1	“And when all these things come upon you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you call them to mind among all the nations where the 
DEU.30.2	and return to the 
DEU.30.3	then the 
DEU.30.4	 If your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of heaven, from there the 
DEU.30.5	and the 
DEU.30.6	And the 
DEU.30.7	And the 
DEU.30.8	And you shall again obey the voice of the 
DEU.30.9	The 
DEU.30.10	if you obey the voice of the 
DEU.30.11	“For this commandment which I command you this day is not too hard for you, neither is it far off. 
DEU.30.12	 It is not in heaven, that you should say, ‘Who will go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?’ 
DEU.30.13	Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, ‘Who will go over the sea for us, and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?’ 
DEU.30.14	 But the word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart, so that you can do it.
DEU.30.15	“See, I have set before you this day life and good, death and evil. 
DEU.30.16	If you obey the commandments of the 
DEU.30.17	But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but are drawn away to worship other gods and serve them, 
DEU.30.18	I declare to you this day, that you shall perish; you shall not live long in the land which you are going over the Jordan to enter and possess. 
DEU.30.19	I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that you and your descendants may live, 
DEU.30.20	loving the 
DEU.31.1	So Moses continued to speak these words to all Israel. 
DEU.31.2	And he said to them, “I am a hundred and twenty years old this day; I am no longer able to go out and come in. The 
DEU.31.3	The 
DEU.31.4	And the 
DEU.31.5	And the 
DEU.31.6	 Be strong and of good courage, do not fear or be in dread of them: for it is the 
DEU.31.7	Then Moses summoned Joshua, and said to him in the sight of all Israel, “Be strong and of good courage; for you shall go with this people into the land which the 
DEU.31.8	It is the 
DEU.31.9	And Moses wrote this law, and gave it to the priests the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the covenant of the 
DEU.31.10	And Moses commanded them, “At the end of every seven years, at the set time of the year of release, at the feast of booths, 
DEU.31.11	when all Israel comes to appear before the 
DEU.31.12	Assemble the people, men, women, and little ones, and the sojourner within your towns, that they may hear and learn to fear the 
DEU.31.13	and that their children, who have not known it, may hear and learn to fear the 
DEU.31.14	And the 
DEU.31.15	And the 
DEU.31.16	And the 
DEU.31.17	Then my anger will be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them and hide my face from them, and they will be devoured; and many evils and troubles will come upon them, so that they will say in that day, ‘Have not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?’ 
DEU.31.18	And I will surely hide my face in that day on account of all the evil which they have done, because they have turned to other gods. 
DEU.31.19	Now therefore write this song, and teach it to the people of Israel; put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the people of Israel. 
DEU.31.20	For when I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, which I swore to give to their fathers, and they have eaten and are full and grown fat, they will turn to other gods and serve them, and despise me and break my covenant. 
DEU.31.21	And when many evils and troubles have come upon them, this song shall confront them as a witness (for it will live unforgotten in the mouths of their descendants); for I know the purposes which they are already forming, before I have brought them into the land that I swore to give.” 
DEU.31.22	So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the people of Israel.
DEU.31.23	And the 
DEU.31.24	When Moses had finished writing the words of this law in a book, to the very end, 
DEU.31.25	Moses commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the 
DEU.31.26	“Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of the 
DEU.31.27	For I know how rebellious and stubborn you are; behold, while I am yet alive with you, today you have been rebellious against the 
DEU.31.28	Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears and call heaven and earth to witness against them. 
DEU.31.29	For I know that after my death you will surely act corruptly, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and in the days to come evil will befall you, because you will do what is evil in the sight of the 
DEU.31.30	Then Moses spoke the words of this song until they were finished, in the ears of all the assembly of Israel:
DEU.32.1	“Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak;
DEU.32.1	and let the earth hear the words of my mouth.
DEU.32.2	May my teaching drop as the rain,
DEU.32.2	my speech distil as the dew,
DEU.32.2	as the gentle rain upon the tender grass,
DEU.32.2	and as the showers upon the herb.
DEU.32.3	For I will proclaim the name of the 
DEU.32.3	Ascribe greatness to our God!
DEU.32.4	“The Rock, his work is perfect;
DEU.32.4	for all his ways are justice.
DEU.32.4	A God of faithfulness and without iniquity,
DEU.32.4	just and right is he.
DEU.32.5	they are no longer his children because of their blemish;
DEU.32.5	they are a perverse and crooked generation.
DEU.32.6	Do you thus requite the 
DEU.32.6	you foolish and senseless people?
DEU.32.6	Is not he your father, who created you,
DEU.32.6	who made you and established you?
DEU.32.7	Remember the days of old,
DEU.32.7	consider the years of many generations;
DEU.32.7	ask your father, and he will show you;
DEU.32.7	your elders, and they will tell you.
DEU.32.8	When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance,
DEU.32.8	when he separated the sons of men,
DEU.32.8	he fixed the bounds of the peoples
DEU.32.8	according to the number of the sons of God.
DEU.32.9	For the 
DEU.32.9	Jacob his allotted heritage.
DEU.32.10	“He found him in a desert land,
DEU.32.10	and in the howling waste of the wilderness;
DEU.32.10	he encircled him, he cared for him,
DEU.32.10	he kept him as the apple of his eye.
DEU.32.11	Like an eagle that stirs up its nest,
DEU.32.11	that flutters over its young,
DEU.32.11	spreading out its wings, catching them,
DEU.32.11	bearing them on its pinions,
DEU.32.12	the 
DEU.32.12	and there was no foreign god with him.
DEU.32.13	He made him ride on the high places of the earth,
DEU.32.13	and he ate the produce of the field;
DEU.32.13	and he made him suck honey out of the rock,
DEU.32.13	and oil out of the flinty rock.
DEU.32.14	Curds from the herd, and milk from the flock,
DEU.32.14	with fat of lambs and rams,
DEU.32.14	herds of Bashan and goats,
DEU.32.14	with the finest of the wheat—
DEU.32.14	and of the blood of the grape you drank wine.
DEU.32.15	“But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked;
DEU.32.15	you waxed fat, you grew thick, you became sleek;
DEU.32.15	then he forsook God who made him,
DEU.32.15	and scoffed at the Rock of his salvation.
DEU.32.16	They stirred him to jealousy with strange gods;
DEU.32.16	with abominable practices they provoked him to anger.
DEU.32.17	to gods they had never known,
DEU.32.17	to new gods that had come in of late,
DEU.32.17	whom your fathers had never dreaded.
DEU.32.18	You were unmindful of the Rock that begot
DEU.32.18	and you forgot the God who gave you birth.
DEU.32.19	“The 
DEU.32.19	because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.
DEU.32.20	And he said, ‘I will hide my face from them,
DEU.32.20	I will see what their end will be,
DEU.32.20	For they are a perverse generation,
DEU.32.20	children in whom is no faithfulness.
DEU.32.21	they have provoked me with their idols.
DEU.32.21	So I will stir them to jealousy with those who are no people;
DEU.32.21	I will provoke them with a foolish nation.
DEU.32.22	For a fire is kindled by my anger,
DEU.32.22	and it burns to the depths of Sheol,
DEU.32.22	devours the earth and its increase,
DEU.32.22	and sets on fire the foundations of the mountains.
DEU.32.23	“ ‘And I will heap evils upon them;
DEU.32.23	I will spend my arrows upon them;
DEU.32.24	they shall be wasted with hunger,
DEU.32.24	and devoured with burning heat
DEU.32.24	and poisonous pestilence;
DEU.32.24	and I will send the teeth of beasts against them,
DEU.32.24	with venom of crawling things of the dust.
DEU.32.25	In the open the sword shall bereave,
DEU.32.25	and in the chambers shall be terror,
DEU.32.25	destroying both young man and virgin,
DEU.32.25	the sucking child with the man of gray hairs.
DEU.32.26	I would have said, “I will scatter them afar,
DEU.32.26	I will make the remembrance of them cease from among men,”
DEU.32.27	had I not feared provocation by the enemy,
DEU.32.27	lest their adversaries should judge amiss,
DEU.32.27	lest they should say, “Our hand is triumphant,
DEU.32.27	the 
DEU.32.28	“For they are a nation void of counsel,
DEU.32.28	and there is no understanding in them.
DEU.32.29	If they were wise, they would understand this,
DEU.32.29	they would discern their latter end!
DEU.32.30	How should one chase a thousand,
DEU.32.30	and two put ten thousand to flight,
DEU.32.30	unless their Rock had sold them,
DEU.32.30	and the 
DEU.32.31	For their rock is not as our Rock,
DEU.32.31	even our enemies themselves being judges.
DEU.32.32	For their vine comes from the vine of Sodom,
DEU.32.32	and from the fields of Gomorrah;
DEU.32.32	their grapes are grapes of poison,
DEU.32.32	their clusters are bitter;
DEU.32.33	their wine is the poison of serpents,
DEU.32.33	and the cruel venom of asps.
DEU.32.34	“Is not this laid up in store with me,
DEU.32.34	sealed up in my treasuries?
DEU.32.35	for the time when their foot shall slip;
DEU.32.35	for the day of their calamity is at hand,
DEU.32.35	and their doom comes swiftly.
DEU.32.36	For the 
DEU.32.36	and have compassion on his servants,
DEU.32.36	when he sees that their power is gone,
DEU.32.36	and there is none remaining, bond or free.
DEU.32.37	Then he will say, ‘Where are their gods,
DEU.32.37	the rock in which they took refuge,
DEU.32.38	who ate the fat of their sacrifices,
DEU.32.38	and drank the wine of their drink offering?
DEU.32.38	Let them rise up and help you,
DEU.32.38	let them be your protection!
DEU.32.39	“ ‘See now that I, even I, am he,
DEU.32.39	and there is no god beside me;
DEU.32.39	I kill and I make alive;
DEU.32.39	I wound and I heal;
DEU.32.39	and there is none that can deliver out of my hand.
DEU.32.40	For I lift up my hand to heaven,
DEU.32.40	and swear, As I live for ever,
DEU.32.41	if I whet my glittering sword,
DEU.32.41	and my hand takes hold on judgment,
DEU.32.41	I will take vengeance on my adversaries,
DEU.32.41	and will requite those who hate me.
DEU.32.42	I will make my arrows drunk with blood,
DEU.32.42	and my sword shall devour flesh—
DEU.32.42	with the blood of the slain and the captives,
DEU.32.42	from the long-haired heads of the enemy.’
DEU.32.43	for he avenges the blood of his servants,
DEU.32.43	and takes vengeance on his adversaries,
DEU.32.43	and makes expiation for the land of his people.”
DEU.32.44	Moses came and recited all the words of this song in the hearing of the people, he and Joshua
DEU.32.45	And when Moses had finished speaking all these words to all Israel, 
DEU.32.46	he said to them, “Lay to heart all the words which I enjoin upon you this day, that you may command them to your children, that they may be careful to do all the words of this law. 
DEU.32.47	For it is no trifle for you, but it is your life, and thereby you shall live long in the land which you are going over the Jordan to possess.”
DEU.32.48	And the 
DEU.32.49	“Ascend this mountain of the Abarim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, opposite Jericho; and view the land of Canaan, which I give to the people of Israel for a possession; 
DEU.32.50	and die on the mountain which you ascend, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died in Mount Hor and was gathered to his people; 
DEU.32.51	because you broke faith with me in the midst of the people of Israel at the waters of Meri-bath-kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you did not revere me as holy in the midst of the people of Israel. 
DEU.32.52	For you shall see the land before you; but you shall not go there, into the land which I give to the people of Israel.”
DEU.33.1	This is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death. 
DEU.33.2	He said,
DEU.33.2	“The 
DEU.33.2	and dawned from Seir upon us;
DEU.33.2	he shone forth from Mount Paran,
DEU.33.2	he came from the ten thousands of holy ones,
DEU.33.2	with flaming fire
DEU.33.3	Yea, he loved his people;
DEU.33.3	all those consecrated to him were in his
DEU.33.3	so they followed
DEU.33.3	receiving direction from thee,
DEU.33.4	when Moses commanded us a law,
DEU.33.4	as a possession for the assembly of Jacob.
DEU.33.5	Thus the 
DEU.33.5	when the heads of the people were gathered,
DEU.33.5	all the tribes of Israel together.
DEU.33.6	“Let Reuben live, and not die,
DEU.33.6	nor let his men be few.”
DEU.33.7	And this he said of Judah:
DEU.33.7	“Hear, O 
DEU.33.7	and bring him in to his people.
DEU.33.7	With thy hands contend
DEU.33.7	and be a help against his adversaries.”
DEU.33.8	And of Levi he said,
DEU.33.8	“Give to Levi
DEU.33.8	and thy Urim to thy godly one,
DEU.33.8	whom thou didst test at Massah,
DEU.33.8	with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;
DEU.33.9	who said of his father and mother,
DEU.33.9	‘I regard them not’;
DEU.33.9	he disowned his brothers,
DEU.33.9	and ignored his children.
DEU.33.9	For they observed thy word,
DEU.33.9	and kept thy covenant.
DEU.33.10	They shall teach Jacob thy ordinances,
DEU.33.10	and Israel thy law;
DEU.33.10	they shall put incense before thee,
DEU.33.10	and whole burnt offering upon thy altar.
DEU.33.11	Bless, O 
DEU.33.11	and accept the work of his hands;
DEU.33.11	crush the loins of his adversaries,
DEU.33.11	of those that hate him, that they rise not again.”
DEU.33.12	Of Benjamin he said,
DEU.33.12	“The beloved of the 
DEU.33.12	he dwells in safety by him;
DEU.33.12	he encompasses him all the day long,
DEU.33.12	and makes his dwelling between his shoulders.”
DEU.33.13	And of Joseph he said,
DEU.33.13	“Blessed by the 
DEU.33.13	with the choicest gifts of heaven above,
DEU.33.13	and of the deep that couches beneath,
DEU.33.14	with the choicest fruits of the sun,
DEU.33.14	and the rich yield of the months,
DEU.33.15	with the finest produce of the ancient mountains,
DEU.33.15	and the abundance of the everlasting hills,
DEU.33.16	with the best gifts of the earth and its fulness,
DEU.33.16	and the favor of him that dwelt in the bush.
DEU.33.16	Let these come upon the head of Joseph,
DEU.33.16	and upon the crown of the head of him that is prince among his brothers.
DEU.33.17	His firstling bull has majesty,
DEU.33.17	and his horns are the horns of a wild ox;
DEU.33.17	with them he shall push the peoples,
DEU.33.17	all of them, to the ends of the earth;
DEU.33.17	such are the ten thousands of Ephraim,
DEU.33.17	and such are the thousands of Manasseh.”
DEU.33.18	And of Zebulun he said,
DEU.33.18	“Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out;
DEU.33.18	and Issachar, in your tents.
DEU.33.19	They shall call peoples to their mountain;
DEU.33.19	there they offer right sacrifices;
DEU.33.19	for they suck the affluence of the seas
DEU.33.19	and the hidden treasures of the sand.”
DEU.33.20	And of Gad he said,
DEU.33.20	“Blessed be he who enlarges Gad!
DEU.33.20	Gad couches like a lion,
DEU.33.20	he tears the arm, and the crown of the head.
DEU.33.21	He chose the best of the land for himself,
DEU.33.21	for there a commander's portion was reserved;
DEU.33.21	and he came to the heads of the people,
DEU.33.21	with Israel he executed the commands
DEU.33.21	and just decrees of the 
DEU.33.22	And of Dan he said,
DEU.33.22	“Dan is a lion's whelp,
DEU.33.22	that leaps forth from Bashan.”
DEU.33.23	And of Naphtali he said,
DEU.33.23	“O Naphtali, satisfied with favor,
DEU.33.23	and full of the blessing of the 
DEU.33.23	possess the lake and the south.”
DEU.33.24	And of Asher he said,
DEU.33.24	“Blessed above sons be Asher;
DEU.33.24	let him be the favorite of his brothers,
DEU.33.24	and let him dip his foot in oil.
DEU.33.25	Your bars shall be iron and bronze;
DEU.33.25	and as your days, so shall your strength be.
DEU.33.26	“There is none like God, O Jeshurun,
DEU.33.26	who rides through the heavens to your help,
DEU.33.26	and in his majesty through the skies.
DEU.33.27	The eternal God is your dwelling place,
DEU.33.27	and underneath are the everlasting arms.
DEU.33.27	And he thrust out the enemy before you,
DEU.33.27	and said, Destroy.
DEU.33.28	So Israel dwelt in safety,
DEU.33.28	the fountain of Jacob alone,
DEU.33.28	in a land of grain and wine;
DEU.33.28	yea, his heavens drop down dew.
DEU.33.29	Happy are you, O Israel! Who is like you,
DEU.33.29	a people saved by the 
DEU.33.29	the shield of your help,
DEU.33.29	and the sword of your triumph!
DEU.33.29	Your enemies shall come fawning to you;
DEU.33.29	and you shall tread upon their high places.”
DEU.34.1	And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho. And the 
DEU.34.2	all Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the western sea, 
DEU.34.3	the Negeb, and the Plain, that is, the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar. 
DEU.34.4	And the 
DEU.34.5	So Moses the servant of the 
DEU.34.6	and he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth-peor; but no man knows the place of his burial to this day. 
DEU.34.7	Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died; his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. 
DEU.34.8	And the people of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.
DEU.34.9	And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands upon him; so the people of Israel obeyed him, and did as the 
DEU.34.10	 And there has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses, whom the 
DEU.34.11	none like him for all the signs and the wonders which the 
DEU.34.12	and for all the mighty power and all the great and terrible deeds which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel.
JOS.1.1	After the death of Moses the servant of the 
JOS.1.2	“Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, into the land which I am giving to them, to the people of Israel. 
JOS.1.3	Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given to you, as I promised to Moses. 
JOS.1.4	From the wilderness and this Lebanon as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your territory. 
JOS.1.5	 No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life; as I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will not fail you or forsake you. 
JOS.1.6	Be strong and of good courage; for you shall cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give them. 
JOS.1.7	Only be strong and very courageous, being careful to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded you; turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may have good success wherever you go. 
JOS.1.8	This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it; for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success. 
JOS.1.9	Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; be not frightened, neither be dismayed; for the 
JOS.1.10	Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, 
JOS.1.11	“Pass through the camp, and command the people, ‘Prepare your provisions; for within three days you are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to take possession of the land which the 
JOS.1.13	“Remember the word which Moses the servant of the 
JOS.1.14	Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan; but all the men of valor among you shall pass over armed before your brethren and shall help them, 
JOS.1.15	until the 
JOS.1.16	And they answered Joshua, “All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. 
JOS.1.17	Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you; only may the 
JOS.1.18	Whoever rebels against your commandment and disobeys your words, whatever you command him, shall be put to death. Only be strong and of good courage.”
JOS.2.1	And Joshua the son of Nun sent two men secretly from Shittim as spies, saying, “Go, view the land, especially Jericho.” And they went, and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lodged there. 
JOS.2.2	And it was told the king of Jericho, “Behold, certain men of Israel have come here tonight to search out the land.” 
JOS.2.3	Then the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, “Bring forth the men that have come to you, who entered your house; for they have come to search out all the land.” 
JOS.2.4	But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them; and she said, “True, men came to me, but I did not know where they came from; 
JOS.2.5	and when the gate was to be closed, at dark, the men went out; where the men went I do not know; pursue them quickly, for you will overtake them.” 
JOS.2.6	But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order on the roof. 
JOS.2.7	So the men pursued after them on the way to the Jordan as far as the fords; and as soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut.
JOS.2.8	Before they lay down, she came up to them on the roof, 
JOS.2.9	and said to the men, “I know that the 
JOS.2.10	For we have heard how the 
JOS.2.11	And as soon as we heard it, our hearts melted, and there was no courage left in any man, because of you; for the 
JOS.2.12	Now then, swear to me by the 
JOS.2.13	and save alive my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and deliver our lives from death.” 
JOS.2.14	And the men said to her, “Our life for yours! If you do not tell this business of ours, then we will deal kindly and faithfully with you when the 
JOS.2.15	Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was built into the city wall, so that she dwelt in the wall. 
JOS.2.16	And she said to them, “Go into the hills, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned; then afterward you may go your way.” 
JOS.2.17	The men said to her, “We will be guiltless with respect to this oath of yours which you have made us swear. 
JOS.2.18	Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down; and you shall gather into your house your father and mother, your brothers, and all your father's household. 
JOS.2.19	If any one goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we shall be guiltless; but if a hand is laid upon any one who is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head. 
JOS.2.20	But if you tell this business of ours, then we shall be guiltless with respect to your oath which you have made us swear.” 
JOS.2.21	And she said, “According to your words, so be it.” Then she sent them away, and they departed; and she bound the scarlet cord in the window.
JOS.2.22	They departed, and went into the hills, and remained there three days, until the pursuers returned; for the pursuers had made search all along the way and found nothing. 
JOS.2.23	Then the two men came down again from the hills, and passed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had befallen them. 
JOS.2.24	And they said to Joshua, “Truly the 
JOS.3.1	Early in the morning Joshua rose and set out from Shittim, with all the people of Israel; and they came to the Jordan, and lodged there before they passed over. 
JOS.3.2	At the end of three days the officers went through the camp 
JOS.3.3	and commanded the people, “When you see the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.3.4	that you may know the way you shall go, for you have not passed this way before. Yet there shall be a space between you and it, a distance of about two thousand cubits; do not come near it.” 
JOS.3.5	And Joshua said to the people, “Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow the 
JOS.3.6	And Joshua said to the priests, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass on before the people.” And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
JOS.3.7	And the 
JOS.3.8	And you shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, ‘When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.’ ” 
JOS.3.9	And Joshua said to the people of Israel, “Come hither, and hear the words of the 
JOS.3.10	And Joshua said, “Hereby you shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites. 
JOS.3.11	Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is to pass over before you into the Jordan. 
JOS.3.12	Now therefore take twelve men from the tribes of Israel, from each tribe a man. 
JOS.3.13	And when the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the 
JOS.3.14	So, when the people set out from their tents, to pass over the Jordan with the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people, 
JOS.3.15	and when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark were dipped in the brink of the water (the Jordan overflows all its banks throughout the time of harvest), 
JOS.3.16	the waters coming down from above stood and rose up in a heap far off, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, and those flowing down toward the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off; and the people passed over opposite Jericho. 
JOS.3.17	And while all Israel were passing over on dry ground, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.4.1	When all the nation had finished passing over the Jordan, the 
JOS.4.2	“Take twelve men from the people, from each tribe a man, 
JOS.4.3	and command them, ‘Take twelve stones from here out of the midst of the Jordan, from the very place where the priests' feet stood, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the place where you lodge tonight.’ ” 
JOS.4.4	Then Joshua called the twelve men from the people of Israel, whom he had appointed, a man from each tribe; 
JOS.4.5	and Joshua said to them, “Pass on before the ark of the 
JOS.4.6	that this may be a sign among you, when your children ask in time to come, ‘What do those stones mean to you?’ 
JOS.4.7	Then you shall tell them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.4.8	And the men of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the people of Israel, as the 
JOS.4.9	And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant had stood; and they are there to this day. 
JOS.4.10	For the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until everything was finished that the 
JOS.4.10	The people passed over in haste; 
JOS.4.11	and when all the people had finished passing over, the ark of the 
JOS.4.12	The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh passed over armed before the people of Israel, as Moses had bidden them; 
JOS.4.13	about forty thousand ready armed for war passed over before the 
JOS.4.14	On that day the 
JOS.4.15	And the 
JOS.4.16	“Command the priests who bear the ark of the testimony to come up out of the Jordan.” 
JOS.4.17	Joshua therefore commanded the priests, “Come up out of the Jordan.” 
JOS.4.18	And when the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.4.19	The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they encamped in Gilgal on the east border of Jericho. 
JOS.4.20	And those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal. 
JOS.4.21	And he said to the people of Israel, “When your children ask their fathers in time to come, ‘What do these stones mean?’ 
JOS.4.22	then you shall let your children know, ‘Israel passed over this Jordan on dry ground.’ 
JOS.4.23	For the 
JOS.4.24	so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the 
JOS.5.1	When all the kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites that were by the sea, heard that the 
JOS.5.2	At that time the 
JOS.5.3	So Joshua made flint knives, and circumcised the people of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth.
JOS.5.4	And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: all the males of the people who came out of Egypt, all the men of war, had died on the way in the wilderness after they had come out of Egypt. 
JOS.5.5	Though all the people who came out had been circumcised, yet all the people that were born on the way in the wilderness after they had come out of Egypt had not been circumcised. 
JOS.5.6	For the people of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the nation, the men of war that came forth out of Egypt, perished, because they did not hearken to the voice of the 
JOS.5.7	So it was their children, whom he raised up in their stead, that Joshua circumcised; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the way.
JOS.5.8	When the circumcising of all the nation was done, they remained in their places in the camp till they were healed. 
JOS.5.9	And the 
JOS.5.10	While the people of Israel were encamped in Gilgal they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho. 
JOS.5.11	And on the morrow after the passover, on that very day, they ate of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain. 
JOS.5.12	And the manna ceased on the morrow, when they ate of the produce of the land; and the people of Israel had manna no more, but ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
JOS.5.13	When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood before him with his drawn sword in his hand; and Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you for us, or for our adversaries?” 
JOS.5.14	And he said, “No; but as commander of the army of the 
JOS.5.15	And the commander of the 
JOS.6.1	Now Jericho was shut up from within and from without because of the people of Israel; none went out, and none came in. 
JOS.6.2	And the 
JOS.6.3	You shall march around the city, all the men of war going around the city once. Thus shall you do for six days. 
JOS.6.4	And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark; and on the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, the priests blowing the trumpets. 
JOS.6.5	And when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, as soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city will fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him.” 
JOS.6.6	So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the 
JOS.6.7	And he said to the people, “Go forward; march around the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of the 
JOS.6.8	And as Joshua had commanded the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the 
JOS.6.9	And the armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while the trumpets blew continually. 
JOS.6.10	But Joshua commanded the people, “You shall not shout or let your voice be heard, neither shall any word go out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then you shall shout.” 
JOS.6.11	So he caused the ark of the 
JOS.6.12	Then Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the 
JOS.6.13	And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the 
JOS.6.14	And the second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp. So they did for six days.
JOS.6.15	On the seventh day they rose early at the dawn of day, and marched around the city in the same manner seven times: it was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times. 
JOS.6.16	And at the seventh time, when the priests had blown the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, “Shout; for the 
JOS.6.17	And the city and all that is within it shall be devoted to the 
JOS.6.18	But you, keep yourselves from the things devoted to destruction, lest when you have devoted them you take any of the devoted things and make the camp of Israel a thing for destruction, and bring trouble upon it. 
JOS.6.19	But all silver and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, are sacred to the 
JOS.6.20	So the people shouted, and the trumpets were blown. As soon as the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people raised a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. 
JOS.6.21	Then they utterly destroyed all in the city, both men and women, young and old, oxen, sheep, and asses, with the edge of the sword.
JOS.6.22	And Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the harlot's house, and bring out from it the woman, and all who belong to her, as you swore to her.” 
JOS.6.23	So the young men who had been spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father and mother and brothers and all who belonged to her; and they brought all her kindred, and set them outside the camp of Israel. 
JOS.6.24	And they burned the city with fire, and all within it; only the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the 
JOS.6.25	But Rahab the harlot, and her father's household, and all who belonged to her, Joshua saved alive; and she dwelt in Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
JOS.6.26	“At the cost of his first-born shall he
JOS.6.26	lay its foundation,
JOS.6.26	and at the cost of his youngest son
JOS.6.26	shall he set up its gates.”
JOS.6.27	So the 
JOS.7.1	But the people of Israel broke faith in regard to the devoted things; for Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things; and the anger of the 
JOS.7.2	Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and said to them, “Go up and spy out the land.” And the men went up and spied out Ai. 
JOS.7.3	And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, “Let not all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai; do not make the whole people toil up there, for they are but few.” 
JOS.7.4	So about three thousand went up there from the people; and they fled before the men of Ai, 
JOS.7.5	and the men of Ai killed about thirty-six men of them, and chased them before the gate as far as Shebarim, and slew them at the descent. And the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.
JOS.7.6	Then Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the 
JOS.7.7	And Joshua said, “Alas, O Lord 
JOS.7.8	O Lord, what can I say, when Israel has turned their backs before their enemies! 
JOS.7.9	For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth; and what wilt thou do for thy great name?”
JOS.7.10	The 
JOS.7.11	Israel has sinned; they have transgressed my covenant which I commanded them; they have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, and lied, and put them among their own stuff. 
JOS.7.12	Therefore the people of Israel cannot stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become a thing for destruction. I will be with you no more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you. 
JOS.7.13	Up, sanctify the people, and say, ‘Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow; for thus says the 
JOS.7.14	In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes; and the tribe which the 
JOS.7.15	And he who is taken with the devoted things shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of the 
JOS.7.16	So Joshua rose early in the morning, and brought Israel near tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was taken; 
JOS.7.17	and he brought near the families of Judah, and the family of the Zerahites was taken; and he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man, and Zabdi was taken; 
JOS.7.18	and he brought near his household man by man, and Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken. 
JOS.7.19	Then Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory to the 
JOS.7.20	And Achan answered Joshua, “Of a truth I have sinned against the 
JOS.7.21	when I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle from Shinar, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, then I coveted them, and took them; and behold, they are hidden in the earth inside my tent, with the silver underneath.”
JOS.7.22	So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and behold, it was hidden in his tent with the silver underneath. 
JOS.7.23	And they took them out of the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the people of Israel; and they laid them down before the 
JOS.7.24	And Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver and the mantle and the bar of gold, and his sons and daughters, and his oxen and asses and sheep, and his tent, and all that he had; and they brought them up to the Valley of Achor. 
JOS.7.25	And Joshua said, “Why did you bring trouble on us? The 
JOS.7.26	And they raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day; then the 
JOS.8.1	And the 
JOS.8.2	and you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king; only its spoil and its cattle you shall take as booty for yourselves; lay an ambush against the city, behind it.”
JOS.8.3	So Joshua arose, and all the fighting men, to go up to Ai; and Joshua chose thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them forth by night. 
JOS.8.4	And he commanded them, “Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind it; do not go very far from the city, but hold yourselves all in readiness; 
JOS.8.5	and I, and all the people who are with me, will approach the city. And when they come out against us, as before, we shall flee before them; 
JOS.8.6	and they will come out after us, till we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, ‘They are fleeing from us, as before.’ So we will flee from them; 
JOS.8.7	then you shall rise up from the ambush, and seize the city; for the 
JOS.8.8	And when you have taken the city, you shall set the city on fire, doing as the 
JOS.8.9	So Joshua sent them forth; and they went to the place of ambush, and lay between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai; but Joshua spent that night among the people.
JOS.8.10	And Joshua arose early in the morning and mustered the people, and went up, with the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai. 
JOS.8.11	And all the fighting men who were with him went up, and drew near before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai, with a ravine between them and Ai. 
JOS.8.12	And he took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city. 
JOS.8.13	So they stationed the forces, the main encampment which was north of the city and its rear guard west of the city. But Joshua spent that night in the valley. 
JOS.8.14	And when the king of Ai saw this he and all his people, the men of the city, made haste and went out early to the descent
JOS.8.15	And Joshua and all Israel made a pretense of being beaten before them, and fled in the direction of the wilderness. 
JOS.8.16	So all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue them, and as they pursued Joshua they were drawn away from the city. 
JOS.8.17	There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, who did not go out after Israel; they left the city open, and pursued Israel.
JOS.8.18	Then the 
JOS.8.19	And the ambush rose quickly out of their place, and as soon as he had stretched out his hand, they ran and entered the city and took it; and they made haste to set the city on fire. 
JOS.8.20	So when the men of Ai looked back, behold, the smoke of the city went up to heaven; and they had no power to flee this way or that, for the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers. 
JOS.8.21	And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city went up, then they turned back and smote the men of Ai. 
JOS.8.22	And the others came forth from the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side; and Israel smote them, until there was left none that survived or escaped. 
JOS.8.23	But the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
JOS.8.24	When Israel had finished slaughtering all the inhabitants of Ai in the open wilderness where they pursued them, and all of them to the very last had fallen by the edge of the sword, all Israel returned to Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword. 
JOS.8.25	And all who fell that day, both men and women, were twelve thousand, all the people of Ai. 
JOS.8.26	For Joshua did not draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. 
JOS.8.27	Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took as their booty, according to the word of the 
JOS.8.28	So Joshua burned Ai, and made it for ever a heap of ruins, as it is to this day. 
JOS.8.29	And he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening; and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised over it a great heap of stones, which stands there to this day.
JOS.8.31	as Moses the servant of the 
JOS.8.32	And there, in the presence of the people of Israel, he wrote upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written. 
JOS.8.33	And all Israel, sojourner as well as homeborn, with their elders and officers and their judges, stood on opposite sides of the ark before the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.8.34	And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law. 
JOS.8.35	There was not a word of all that Moses commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners who lived among them.
JOS.9.1	When all the kings who were beyond the Jordan in the hill country and in the lowland all along the coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, heard of this, 
JOS.9.2	they gathered together with one accord to fight Joshua and Israel.
JOS.9.3	But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai, 
JOS.9.4	they on their part acted with cunning, and went and made ready provisions, and took worn-out sacks upon their asses, and wineskins, worn-out and torn and mended, 
JOS.9.5	with worn-out, patched sandals on their feet, and worn-out clothes; and all their provisions were dry and moldy. 
JOS.9.6	And they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Israel, “We have come from a far country; so now make a covenant with us.” 
JOS.9.7	But the men of Israel said to the Hivites, “Perhaps you live among us; then how can we make a covenant with you?” 
JOS.9.8	They said to Joshua, “We are your servants.” And Joshua said to them, “Who are you? And where do you come from?” 
JOS.9.9	They said to him, “From a very far country your servants have come, because of the name of the 
JOS.9.10	and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth. 
JOS.9.11	And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country said to us, ‘Take provisions in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, “We are your servants; come now, make a covenant with us.” ’ 
JOS.9.12	Here is our bread; it was still warm when we took it from our houses as our food for the journey, on the day we set forth to come to you, but now, behold, it is dry and moldy; 
JOS.9.13	these wineskins were new when we filled them, and behold, they are burst; and these garments and shoes of ours are worn out from the very long journey.” 
JOS.9.14	So the men partook of their provisions, and did not ask direction from the 
JOS.9.15	And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live; and the leaders of the congregation swore to them.
JOS.9.16	At the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelt among them. 
JOS.9.17	And the people of Israel set out and reached their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Be-eroth, and Kiriath-jearim. 
JOS.9.18	But the people of Israel did not kill them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the 
JOS.9.19	But all the leaders said to all the congregation, “We have sworn to them by the 
JOS.9.20	This we will do to them, and let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we swore to them.” 
JOS.9.21	And the leaders said to them, “Let them live.” So they became hewers of wood and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the leaders had said of them.
JOS.9.22	Joshua summoned them, and he said to them, “Why did you deceive us, saying, ‘We are very far from you,’ when you dwell among us? 
JOS.9.23	Now therefore you are cursed, and some of you shall always be slaves, hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.” 
JOS.9.24	They answered Joshua, “Because it was told to your servants for a certainty that the 
JOS.9.25	And now, behold, we are in your hand: do as it seems good and right in your sight to do to us.” 
JOS.9.26	So he did to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the people of Israel; and they did not kill them. 
JOS.9.27	But Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the 
JOS.10.1	When Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it, doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them, 
JOS.10.2	he
JOS.10.3	So Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, to Piram king of Jarmuth, to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying, 
JOS.10.4	“Come up to me, and help me, and let us smite Gibeon; for it has made peace with Joshua and with the people of Israel.” 
JOS.10.5	Then the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered their forces, and went up with all their armies and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it.
JOS.10.6	And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, saying, “Do not relax your hand from your servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill country are gathered against us.” 
JOS.10.7	So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor. 
JOS.10.8	And the 
JOS.10.9	So Joshua came upon them suddenly, having marched up all night from Gilgal. 
JOS.10.10	And the 
JOS.10.11	And as they fled before Israel, while they were going down the ascent of Beth-horon, the 
JOS.10.12	Then spoke Joshua to the 
JOS.10.12	“Sun, stand thou still at Gibeon,
JOS.10.12	and thou Moon in the valley of Aijalon.”
JOS.10.13	And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed,
JOS.10.13	until the nation took vengeance on their enemies.
JOS.10.13	Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? The sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day. 
JOS.10.14	There has been no day like it before or since, when the 
JOS.10.15	Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
JOS.10.16	These five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah. 
JOS.10.17	And it was told Joshua, “The five kings have been found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.” 
JOS.10.18	And Joshua said, “Roll great stones against the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them; 
JOS.10.19	but do not stay there yourselves, pursue your enemies, fall upon their rear, do not let them enter their cities; for the 
JOS.10.20	When Joshua and the men of Israel had finished slaying them with a very great slaughter, until they were wiped out, and when the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities, 
JOS.10.21	all the people returned safe to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah; not a man moved his tongue against any of the people of Israel.
JOS.10.22	Then Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings out to me from the cave.” 
JOS.10.23	And they did so, and brought those five kings out to him from the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon. 
JOS.10.24	And when they brought those kings out to Joshua, Joshua summoned all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, “Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings.” Then they came near, and put their feet on their necks. 
JOS.10.25	And Joshua said to them, “Do not be afraid or dismayed; be strong and of good courage; for thus the 
JOS.10.26	And afterward Joshua smote them and put them to death, and he hung them on five trees. And they hung upon the trees until evening; 
JOS.10.27	but at the time of the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves, and they set great stones against the mouth of the cave, which remain to this very day.
JOS.10.28	And Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and smote it and its king with the edge of the sword; he utterly destroyed every person in it, he left none remaining; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.
JOS.10.29	Then Joshua passed on from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah; 
JOS.10.30	and the 
JOS.10.31	And Joshua passed on from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and laid siege to it, and assaulted it: 
JOS.10.32	and the 
JOS.10.33	Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he left none remaining.
JOS.10.34	And Joshua passed on with all Israel from Lachish to Eglon; and they laid siege to it, and assaulted it; 
JOS.10.35	and they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword; and every person in it he utterly destroyed that day, as he had done to Lachish.
JOS.10.36	Then Joshua went up with all Israel from Eglon to Hebron; and they assaulted it, 
JOS.10.37	and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and its king and its towns, and every person in it; he left none remaining, as he had done to Eglon, and utterly destroyed it with every person in it.
JOS.10.38	Then Joshua, with all Israel, turned back to Debir and assaulted it, 
JOS.10.39	and he took it with its king and all its towns; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed every person in it; he left none remaining; as he had done to Hebron and to Libnah and its king, so he did to Debir and to its king.
JOS.10.40	So Joshua defeated the whole land, the hill country and the Negeb and the lowland and the slopes, and all their kings; he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the 
JOS.10.41	And Joshua defeated them from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, as far as Gibeon. 
JOS.10.42	And Joshua took all these kings and their land at one time, because the 
JOS.10.43	Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
JOS.11.1	When Jabin king of Hazor heard of this, he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph, 
JOS.11.2	and to the kings who were in the northern hill country, and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and in Naphoth-dor on the west, 
JOS.11.3	to the Canaanites in the east and the west, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, and the Jebusites in the hill country, and the Hivites under Hermon in the land of Mizpah. 
JOS.11.4	And they came out, with all their troops, a great host, in number like the sand that is upon the seashore, with very many horses and chariots. 
JOS.11.5	And all these kings joined their forces, and came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.
JOS.11.6	And the 
JOS.11.7	So Joshua came suddenly upon them with all his people of war, by the waters of Merom, and fell upon them. 
JOS.11.8	And the 
JOS.11.9	And Joshua did to them as the 
JOS.11.10	And Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and smote its king with the sword; for Hazor formerly was the head of all those kingdoms. 
JOS.11.11	And they put to the sword all who were in it, utterly destroying them; there was none left that breathed, and he burned Hazor with fire. 
JOS.11.12	And all the cities of those kings, and all their kings, Joshua took, and smote them with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them, as Moses the servant of the 
JOS.11.13	But none of the cities that stood on mounds did Israel burn, except Hazor only; that Joshua burned. 
JOS.11.14	And all the spoil of these cities and the cattle, the people of Israel took for their booty; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, and they did not leave any that breathed. 
JOS.11.15	As the 
JOS.11.16	So Joshua took all that land, the hill country and all the Negeb and all the land of Goshen and the lowland and the Arabah and the hill country of Israel and its lowland 
JOS.11.17	from Mount Halak, that rises toward Seir, as far as Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. And he took all their kings, and smote them, and put them to death. 
JOS.11.18	Joshua made war a long time with all those kings. 
JOS.11.19	There was not a city that made peace with the people of Israel, except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon; they took all in battle. 
JOS.11.20	For it was the 
JOS.11.21	And Joshua came at that time, and wiped out the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel; Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities. 
JOS.11.22	There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the people of Israel; only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, did some remain. 
JOS.11.23	So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the 
JOS.12.1	Now these are the kings of the land, whom the people of Israel defeated, and took possession of their land beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon, with all the Arabah eastward: 
JOS.12.2	Sihon king of the Amorites who dwelt at Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and from the middle of the valley as far as the river Jabbok, the boundary of the Ammonites, that is, half of Gilead, 
JOS.12.3	and the Arabah to the Sea of Chinneroth eastward, and in the direction of Beth-jeshimoth, to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, southward to the foot of the slopes of Pisgah; 
JOS.12.4	and Og
JOS.12.5	and ruled over Mount Hermon and Salecah and all Bashan to the boundary of the Geshurites and the Ma-acathites, and over half of Gilead to the boundary of Sihon king of Heshbon. 
JOS.12.6	Moses, the servant of the 
JOS.12.7	And these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the people of Israel defeated on the west side of the Jordan, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak, that rises toward Seir (and Joshua gave their land to the tribes of Israel as a possession according to their allotments, 
JOS.12.8	in the hill country, in the lowland, in the Arabah, in the slopes, in the wilderness, and in the Negeb, the land of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites): 
JOS.12.9	the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one; 
JOS.12.10	the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; 
JOS.12.11	the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one; 
JOS.12.12	the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one; 
JOS.12.13	the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one; 
JOS.12.14	the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one; 
JOS.12.15	the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one; 
JOS.12.16	the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one; 
JOS.12.17	the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one; 
JOS.12.18	the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one; 
JOS.12.19	the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one; 
JOS.12.20	the king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one; 
JOS.12.21	the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one; 
JOS.12.22	the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokne-am in Carmel, one; 
JOS.12.23	the king of Dor in Naphath-dor, one; the king of Goiim in Galilee,
JOS.12.24	the king of Tirzah, one: in all, thirty-one kings.
JOS.13.1	Now Joshua was old and advanced in years; and the 
JOS.13.2	This is the land that yet remains: all the regions of the Philistines, and all those of the Geshurites 
JOS.13.3	(from the Shihor, which is east of Egypt, northward to the boundry of Ekron, it is reckoned as Canaanite; there are five rulers of the Philistines, those of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron), and those of the Avvim, 
JOS.13.4	in the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah which belongs to the Sidonians, to Aphek, to the boundary of the Amorites, 
JOS.13.5	and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamath, 
JOS.13.6	all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, even all the Sidonians. I will myself drive them out from before the people of Israel; only allot the land to Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded you. 
JOS.13.7	Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and half the tribe of Manasseh.”
JOS.13.8	With the other half of the tribe of Manasseh
JOS.13.9	from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the tableland of Medeba as far as Dibon; 
JOS.13.10	and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, as far as the boundary of the Ammonites; 
JOS.13.11	and Gilead, and the region of the Geshurites and Ma-acathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salecah; 
JOS.13.12	all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edre-i (he alone was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); these Moses had defeated and driven out. 
JOS.13.13	Yet the people of Israel did not drive out the Geshurites or the Ma-acathites; but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day.
JOS.13.14	To the tribe of Levi alone Moses gave no inheritance; the offerings by fire to the 
JOS.13.15	And Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the Reubenites according to their families. 
JOS.13.16	So their territory was from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the tableland by Medeba; 
JOS.13.17	with Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the tableland; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon, 
JOS.13.18	and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mepha-ath, 
JOS.13.19	and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth-shahar on the hill of the valley, 
JOS.13.20	and Beth-peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth, 
JOS.13.21	that is, all the cities of the tableland, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses defeated with the leaders of Midian, Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who dwelt in the land. 
JOS.13.22	Balaam also, the son of Beor, the soothsayer, the people of Israel killed with the sword among the rest of their slain. 
JOS.13.23	And the border of the people of Reuben was the Jordan as a boundary. This was the inheritance of the Reubenites, according to their families with their cities and villages.
JOS.13.24	And Moses gave an inheritance also to the tribe of the Gadites, according to their families. 
JOS.13.25	Their territory was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the Ammonites, to Aroer, which is east of Rabbah, 
JOS.13.26	and from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the territory of Debir,
JOS.13.27	and in the valley Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, having the Jordan as a boundary, to the lower end of the Sea of Chinnereth, eastward beyond the Jordan. 
JOS.13.28	This is the inheritance of the Gadites according to their families, with their cities and villages.
JOS.13.29	And Moses gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh; it was allotted to the half-tribe of the Manassites according to their families. 
JOS.13.30	Their region extended from Mahanaim, through all Bashan, the whole kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities, 
JOS.13.31	and half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edre-i, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan; these were allotted to the people of Machir the son of Manasseh for the half of the Machirites according to their families.
JOS.13.32	These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan east of Jericho. 
JOS.13.33	But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance; the 
JOS.14.1	And these are the inheritances which the people of Israel received in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the people of Israel distributed to them. 
JOS.14.2	Their inheritance was by lot, as the 
JOS.14.3	For Moses had given an inheritance to the two and one-half tribes beyond the Jordan; but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them. 
JOS.14.4	For the people of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim; and no portion was given to the Levites in the land, but only cities to dwell in, with their pasture lands for their cattle and their substance. 
JOS.14.5	The people of Israel did as the 
JOS.14.7	I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the 
JOS.14.8	But my brethren who went up with me made the heart of the people melt; yet I wholly followed the 
JOS.14.9	And Moses swore on that day, saying, ‘Surely the land on which your foot has trodden shall be an inheritance for you and your children for ever, because you have wholly followed the 
JOS.14.10	And now, behold, the 
JOS.14.11	I am still as strong to this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me; my strength now is as my strength was then, for war, and for going and coming. 
JOS.14.12	So now give me this hill country of which the 
JOS.14.13	Then Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance. 
JOS.14.14	So Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he wholly followed the 
JOS.14.15	Now the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba;
JOS.15.1	The lot for the tribe of the people of Judah according to their families reached southward to the boundary of Edom, to the wilderness of Zin at the farthest south. 
JOS.15.2	And their south boundary ran from the end of the Salt Sea, from the bay that faces southward; 
JOS.15.3	it goes out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, passes along to Zin, and goes up south of Kadesh-barnea, along by Hezron, up to Addar, turns about to Karka, 
JOS.15.4	passes along to Azmon, goes out by the Brook of Egypt, and comes to its end at the sea. This shall be your south boundary. 
JOS.15.5	And the east boundary is the Salt Sea, to the mouth of the Jordan. And the boundary on the north side runs from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan; 
JOS.15.6	and the boundary goes up to Beth-hoglah, and passes along north of Beth-arabah; and the boundary goes up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben; 
JOS.15.7	and the boundary goes up to Debir from the Valley of Achor, and so northward, turning toward Gilgal, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the valley; and the boundary passes along to the waters of En-shemesh, and ends at En-rogel; 
JOS.15.8	then the boundary goes up by the valley of the son of Hinnom at the southern shoulder of the Jebusite (that is, Jerusalem); and the boundary goes up to the top of the mountain that lies over against the valley of Hinnom, on the west, at the northern end of the valley of Rephaim; 
JOS.15.9	then the boundary extends from the top of the mountain to the spring of the Waters of Nephtoah, and from there to the cities of Mount Ephron; then the boundary bends round to Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim); 
JOS.15.10	and the boundary circles west of Baalah to Mount Seir, passes along to the northern shoulder of Mount Jearim (that is, Chesalon), and goes down to Beth-shemesh, and passes along by Timnah; 
JOS.15.11	the boundary goes out to the shoulder of the hill north of Ekron, then the boundary bends round to Shikkeron, and passes along to Mount Baalah, and goes out to Jabneel; then the boundary comes to an end at the sea. 
JOS.15.12	And the west boundary was the Great Sea with its coast-line. This is the boundary round about the people of Judah according to their families.
JOS.15.13	According to the commandment of the

JOS.15.15	And he went up from there against the inhabitants of Debir; now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher. 
JOS.15.16	And Caleb said, “Whoever smites Kiriath-sepher, and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife.” 
JOS.15.17	And Othni-el the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife. 
JOS.15.18	When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field; and she alighted from her ass, and Caleb said to her, “What do you wish?” 
JOS.15.19	She said to him, “Give me a present; since you have set me in the land of the Negeb, give me also springs of water.” And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
JOS.15.20	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the people of Judah according to their families.

JOS.16.1	The allotment of the descendants of Joseph went from the Jordan by Jericho, east of the waters of Jericho, into the wilderness, going up from Jericho into the hill country to Bethel; 
JOS.16.2	then going from Bethel to Luz, it passes along to Ataroth, the territory of the Archites; 
JOS.16.3	then it goes down westward to the territory of the Japhletites, as far as the territory of Lower Beth-horon, then to Gezer, and it ends at the sea.
JOS.16.4	The people of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, received their inheritance.
JOS.16.5	The territory of the Ephraimites by their families was as follows: the boundary of their inheritance on the east was Ataroth-addar as far as Upper Beth-horon, 
JOS.16.6	and the boundary goes thence to the sea; on the north is Mich-methath; then on the east the boundary turns round toward Taanath-shiloh, and passes along beyond it on the east to Jan-oah, 
JOS.16.7	then it goes down from Jan-oah to Ataroth and to Naarah, and touches Jericho, ending at the Jordan. 
JOS.16.8	From Tappuah the boundary goes westward to the brook Kanah, and ends at the sea. Such is the inheritance of the tribe of the Ephraimites by their families, 
JOS.16.9	together with the towns which were set apart for the Ephraimites within the inheritance of the Manassites, all those towns with their villages. 
JOS.16.10	 However they did not drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: so the Canaanites have dwelt in the midst of Ephraim to this day but have become slaves to do forced labor.
JOS.17.1	Then allotment was made to the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the first-born of Joseph. To Machir the first-born of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, were allotted Gilead and Bashan, because he was a man of war. 
JOS.17.2	And allotments were made to the rest of the tribe of Manasseh, by their families, Abi-ezer, Helek, Asri-el, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida; these were the male descendants of Manasseh the son of Joseph, by their families.
JOS.17.4	They came before Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the leaders, and said, “The 
JOS.17.5	Thus there fell to Manasseh ten portions, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is on the other side of the Jordan; 
JOS.17.6	because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance along with his sons. The land of Gilead was allotted to the rest of the Manassites.
JOS.17.7	The territory of Manasseh reached from Asher to Mich-methath, which is east of Shechem; then the boundary goes along southward to the inhabitants of En-tappuah. 
JOS.17.8	The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but the town of Tappuah on the boundary of Manasseh belonged to the sons of Ephraim. 
JOS.17.9	Then the boundary went down to the brook Kanah. The cities here, to the south of the brook, among the cities of Manasseh, belong to Ephraim. Then the boundary of Manasseh goes on the north side of the brook and ends at the sea; 
JOS.17.10	the land to the south being Ephraim's and that to the north being Manasseh's, with the sea forming its boundary; on the north Asher is reached, and on the east Issachar. 
JOS.17.11	 Also in Issachar and in Asher Manasseh had Beth-shean and its villages, and Ibleam and its villages, and the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its villages, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its villages, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; the third is Naphath.
JOS.17.12	Yet the sons of Manasseh could not take possession of those cities; but the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in that land. 
JOS.17.13	But when the people of Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, and did not utterly drive them out.
JOS.17.14	And the tribe of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, “Why have you given me but one lot and one portion as an inheritance, although I am a numerous people, since hitherto the 
JOS.17.15	And Joshua said to them, “If you are a numerous people, go up to the forest, and there clear ground for yourselves in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim, since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you.” 
JOS.17.16	The tribe of Joseph said, “The hill country is not enough for us; yet all the Canaanites who dwell in the plain have chariots of iron, both those in Beth-shean and its villages and those in the Valley of Jezreel.” 
JOS.17.17	Then Joshua said to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh, “You are a numerous people, and have great power; you shall not have one lot only, 
JOS.17.18	but the hill country shall be yours, for though it is a forest, you shall clear it and possess it to its farthest borders; for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong.”
JOS.18.1	Then the whole congregation of the people of Israel assembled at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there; the land lay subdued before them.
JOS.18.2	There remained among the people of Israel seven tribes whose inheritance had not yet been apportioned. 
JOS.18.3	So Joshua said to the people of Israel, “How long will you be slack to go in and take possession of the land, which the 
JOS.18.4	Provide three men from each tribe, and I will send them out that they may set out and go up and down the land, writing a description of it with a view to their inheritances, and then come to me. 
JOS.18.5	They shall divide it into seven portions, Judah continuing in his territory on the south, and the house of Joseph in their territory on the north. 
JOS.18.6	And you shall describe the land in seven divisions and bring the description here to me; and I will cast lots for you here before the 
JOS.18.7	The Levites have no portion among you, for the priesthood of the 
JOS.18.8	So the men started on their way; and Joshua charged those who went to write the description of the land, saying, “Go up and down and write a description of the land, and come again to me; and I will cast lots for you here before the 
JOS.18.9	So the men went and passed up and down in the land and set down in a book a description of it by towns in seven divisions; then they came to Joshua in the camp at Shiloh, 
JOS.18.10	and Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the 
JOS.18.11	The lot of the tribe of Benjamin according to its families came up, and the territory allotted to it fell between the tribe of Judah and the tribe of Joseph. 
JOS.18.12	On the north side their boundary began at the Jordan; then the boundary goes up to the shoulder north of Jericho, then up through the hill country westward; and it ends at the wilderness of Beth-aven. 
JOS.18.13	From there the boundary passes along southward in the direction of Luz, to the shoulder of Luz (the same is Bethel), then the boundary goes down to Ataroth-addar, upon the mountain that lies south of Lower Beth-horon. 
JOS.18.14	Then the boundary goes in another direction, turning on the western side southward from the mountain that lies to the south, opposite Beth-horon, and it ends at Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), a city belonging to the tribe of Judah. This forms the western side. 
JOS.18.15	And the southern side begins at the outskirts of Kiriath-jearim; and the boundary goes from there to Ephron,
JOS.18.16	then the boundary goes down to the border of the mountain that overlooks the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is at the north end of the valley of Rephaim; and it then goes down the valley of Hinnom, south of the shoulder of the Jebusites, and downward to En-rogel; 
JOS.18.17	then it bends in a northerly direction going on to En-shemesh, and thence goes to Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim; then it goes down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben; 
JOS.18.18	and passing on to the north of the shoulder of Beth-arabah
JOS.18.19	then the boundary passes on to the north of the shoulder of Beth-hoglah; and the boundary ends at the northern bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan: this is the southern border. 
JOS.18.20	The Jordan forms its boundary on the eastern side. This is the inheritance of the tribe of Benjamin, according to its families, boundary by boundary round about.
JOS.18.21	Now the cities of the tribe of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, Beth-hoglah, Emek-keziz, 
JOS.18.22	Beth-arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel, 
JOS.18.23	Avvim, Parah, Ophrah,

JOS.18.26	Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah, 
JOS.18.27	Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah, 
JOS.18.28	Zela, Ha-eleph, Jebus
JOS.19.1	The second lot came out for Simeon, for the tribe of Simeon, according to its families; and its inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the tribe of Judah. 
JOS.19.2	And it had for its inheritance Beer-sheba, Sheba, Moladah,

JOS.19.7	En-rimmon, Ether, and Ashan—four cities with their villages; 
JOS.19.8	together with all the villages round about these cities as far as Baalath-beer, Ramah of the Negeb. This was the inheritance of the tribe of Simeon according to its families. 
JOS.19.9	The inheritance of the tribe of Simeon formed part of the territory of Judah; because the portion of the tribe of Judah was too large for them, the tribe of Simeon obtained an inheritance in the midst of their inheritance.
JOS.19.10	The third lot came up for the tribe of Zebulun, according to its families. And the territory of its inheritance reached as far as Sarid; 
JOS.19.11	then its boundary goes up westward, and on to Mareal, and touches Dabbesheth, then the brook which is east of Jokne-am; 
JOS.19.12	from Sarid it goes in the other direction eastward toward the sunrise to the boundary of Chisloth-tabor; thence it goes to Daberath, then up to Japhia; 
JOS.19.13	from there it passes along on the east toward the sunrise to Gath-hepher, to Eth-kazin, and going on to Rimmon it bends toward Neah; 
JOS.19.14	then on the north the boundary turns about to Hannathon, and it ends at the valley of Iphtahel; 
JOS.19.15	and Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem—twelve cities with their villages. 
JOS.19.16	This is the inheritance of the tribe of Zebulun, according to its families—these cities with their villages.

JOS.19.22	the boundary also touches Tabor, Shahazumah, and Beth-shemesh, and its boundary ends at the Jordan—sixteen cities with their villages. 
JOS.19.23	This is the inheritance of the tribe of Issachar, according to its families—the cities with their villages.
JOS.19.24	The fifth lot came out for the tribe of Asher according to its families. 
JOS.19.25	Its territory included Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph, 
JOS.19.26	Allammelech, Amad, and Mishal; on the west it touches Carmel and Shihor-libnath, 
JOS.19.27	then it turns eastward, it goes to Beth-dagon, and touches Zebulun and the valley of Iphtahel northward to Beth-emek and Neiel; then it continues in the north to Cabul, 
JOS.19.28	Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, Kanah, as far as Sidon the Great;

JOS.19.33	And its boundary ran from Heleph, from the oak in Za-anannim, and Adami-nekeb, and Jabneel, as far as Lakkum; and it ended at the Jordan; 
JOS.19.34	then the boundary turns westward to Aznoth-tabor, and goes from there to Hukkok, touching Zebulun at the south, and Asher on the west, and Judah on the east at the Jordan. 
JOS.19.35	The fortified cities are Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth,

JOS.19.46	and Me-jarkon and Rakkon with the territory over against Joppa. 
JOS.19.47	 When the territory of the Danites was lost to them, the Danites went up and fought against Leshem, and after capturing it and putting it to the sword they took possession of it and settled in it, calling Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their ancestor. 
JOS.19.48	This is the inheritance of the tribe of Dan, according to their families—these cities with their villages.
JOS.19.49	When they had finished distributing the several territories of the land as inheritances, the people of Israel gave an inheritance among them to Joshua the son of Nun. 
JOS.19.50	By command of the 
JOS.19.51	These are the inheritances which Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the people of Israel distributed by lot at Shiloh before the 
JOS.20.1	Then the 
JOS.20.2	 “Say to the people of Israel, ‘Appoint the cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you through Moses, 
JOS.20.3	that the manslayer who kills any person without intent or unwittingly may flee there; they shall be for you a refuge from the avenger of blood. 
JOS.20.4	He shall flee to one of these cities and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and explain his case to the elders of that city; then they shall take him into the city, and give him a place, and he shall remain with them. 
JOS.20.5	And if the avenger of blood pursues him, they shall not give up the slayer into his hand; because he killed his neighbor unwittingly, having had no enmity against him in times past. 
JOS.20.6	And he shall remain in that city until he has stood before the congregation for judgment, until the death of him who is high priest at the time: then the slayer may go again to his own town and his own home, to the town from which he fled.’ ”
JOS.20.7	So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, and Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah. 
JOS.20.8	And beyond the Jordan east of Jericho, they appointed Bezer in the wilderness on the tableland, from the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead, from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan, from the tribe of Manasseh. 
JOS.20.9	These were the cities designated for all the people of Israel, and for the stranger sojourning among them, that any one who killed a person without intent could flee there, so that he might not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, till he stood before the congregation.
JOS.21.2	and they said to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, “The 
JOS.21.3	So by command of the 
JOS.21.4	The lot came out for the families of the Kohathites. So those Levites who were descendants of Aaron the priest received by lot from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin, thirteen cities.
JOS.21.5	And the rest of the Kohathites received by lot from the families of the tribe of Ephraim, from the tribe of Dan and the half-tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.
JOS.21.6	The Gershonites received by lot from the families of the tribe of Issachar, from the tribe of Asher, from the tribe of Naphtali, and from the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.
JOS.21.7	The Merarites according to their families received from the tribe of Reuben, the tribe of Gad, and the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.
JOS.21.8	These cities and their pasture lands the people of Israel gave by lot to the Levites, as the 
JOS.21.9	Out of the tribe of Judah and the tribe of Simeon they gave the following cities mentioned by name, 
JOS.21.10	which went to the descendants of Aaron, one of the families of the Kohathites who belonged to the Levites; since the lot fell to them first. 
JOS.21.11	They gave them Kiriath-arba (Arba being the father of Anak), that is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, along with the pasture lands round about it. 
JOS.21.12	But the fields of the city and its villages had been given to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as his possession.
JOS.21.13	And to the descendants of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron, the city of refuge for the slayer, with its pasture lands, Libnah with its pasture lands,

JOS.21.20	As to the rest of the Kohathites belonging to the Kohathite families of the Levites, the cities allotted to them were out of the tribe of Ephraim. 
JOS.21.21	To them were given Shechem, the city of refuge for the slayer, with its pasture lands in the hill country of Ephraim, Gezer with its pasture lands,

JOS.21.26	The cities of the families of the rest of the Kohathites were ten in all with their pasture lands.
JOS.21.27	And to the Gershonites, one of the families of the Levites, were given out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Golan in Bashan with its pasture lands, the city of refuge for the slayer, and Be-eshterah with its pasture lands—two cities;

JOS.21.29	Jarmuth with its pasture lands, En-gannim with its pasture lands—four cities; 
JOS.21.30	and out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its pasture lands, Abdon with its pasture lands, 
JOS.21.31	Helkath with its pasture lands, and Rehob with its pasture lands—four cities; 
JOS.21.32	and out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its pasture lands, the city of refuge for the slayer, Hammoth-dor with its pasture lands, and Kartan with its pasture lands—three cities. 
JOS.21.33	The cities of the several families of the Gershonites were in all thirteen cities with their pasture lands.
JOS.21.34	And to the rest of the Levites, the Merarite families, were given out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokne-am with its pasture lands, Kartah with its pasture lands,

JOS.21.41	The cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the people of Israel were in all forty-eight cities with their pasture lands. 
JOS.21.42	These cities had each its pasture lands round about it; so it was with all these cities.
JOS.21.43	Thus the

JOS.22.5	Take good care to observe the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the 
JOS.22.6	So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went to their homes.
JOS.22.7	Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan; but to the other half Joshua had given a possession beside their brethren in the land west of the Jordan. And when Joshua sent them away to their homes and blessed them, 
JOS.22.8	he said to them, “Go back to your homes with much wealth, and with very many cattle, with silver, gold, bronze, and iron, and with much clothing; divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.” 
JOS.22.9	So the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned home, parting from the people of Israel at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, their own land of which they had possessed themselves by command of the 
JOS.22.10	And when they came to the region about the Jordan, that lies in the land of Canaan, the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, an altar of great size. 
JOS.22.11	And the people of Israel heard say, “Behold, the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar at the frontier of the land of Canaan, in the region about the Jordan, on the side that belongs to the people of Israel.” 
JOS.22.12	And when the people of Israel heard of it, the whole assembly of the people of Israel gathered at Shiloh, to make war against them.
JOS.22.13	Then the people of Israel sent to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, 
JOS.22.14	and with him ten chiefs, one from each of the tribal families of Israel, every one of them the head of a family among the clans of Israel. 
JOS.22.15	And they came to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead, and they said to them, 
JOS.22.16	“Thus says the whole congregation of the 
JOS.22.17	Have we not had enough of the sin at Peor from which even yet we have not cleansed ourselves, and for which there came plague upon the congregation of the 
JOS.22.18	that you must turn away this day from following the 
JOS.22.19	But now, if your land is unclean, pass over into the 
JOS.22.20	Did not Achan the son of Zerah break faith in the matter of the devoted things, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? And he did not perish alone for his iniquity.’ ”
JOS.22.21	Then the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh said in answer to the heads of the families of Israel, 
JOS.22.22	“The Mighty One, God, the 
JOS.22.23	for building an altar to turn away from following the 
JOS.22.24	Nay, but we did it from fear that in time to come your children might say to our children, ‘What have you to do with the 
JOS.22.25	For the 
JOS.22.26	Therefore we said, ‘Let us now build an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice, 
JOS.22.27	but to be a witness between us and you, and between the generations after us, that we do perform the service of the 
JOS.22.28	And we thought, If this should be said to us or to our descendants in time to come, we should say, ‘Behold the copy of the altar of the 
JOS.22.29	Far be it from us that we should rebel against the 
JOS.22.30	When Phinehas the priest and the chiefs of the congregation, the heads of the families of Israel who were with him, heard the words that the Reubenites and the Gadites and the Manassites spoke, it pleased them well. 
JOS.22.31	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the Manassites, “Today we know that the 
JOS.22.32	Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the chiefs, returned from the Reubenites and the Gadites in the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the people of Israel, and brought back word to them. 
JOS.22.33	And the report pleased the people of Israel; and the people of Israel blessed God and spoke no more of making war against them, to destroy the land where the Reubenites and the Gadites were settled. 
JOS.22.34	The Reubenites and the Gadites called the altar Witness; “For,” said they, “it is a witness between us that the 
JOS.23.1	A long time afterward, when the 
JOS.23.2	Joshua summoned all Israel, their elders and heads, their judges and officers, and said to them, “I am now old and well advanced in years; 
JOS.23.3	and you have seen all that the 
JOS.23.4	Behold, I have allotted to you as an inheritance for your tribes those nations that remain, along with all the nations that I have already cut off, from the Jordan to the Great Sea in the west. 
JOS.23.5	The 
JOS.23.6	Therefore be very steadfast to keep and do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, turning aside from it neither to the right hand nor to the left, 
JOS.23.7	that you may not be mixed with these nations left here among you, or make mention of the names of their gods, or swear by them, or serve them, or bow down yourselves to them, 
JOS.23.8	but cleave to the 
JOS.23.9	For the 
JOS.23.10	One man of you puts to flight a thousand, since it is the 
JOS.23.11	Take good heed to yourselves, therefore, to love the 
JOS.23.12	For if you turn back, and join the remnant of these nations left here among you, and make marriages with them, so that you marry their women and they yours, 
JOS.23.13	know assuredly that the 
JOS.23.14	“And now I am about to go the way of all the earth, and you know in your hearts and souls, all of you, that not one thing has failed of all the good things which the 
JOS.23.15	But just as all the good things which the 
JOS.23.16	if you transgress the covenant of the 
JOS.24.1	Then Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and summoned the elders, the heads, the judges, and the officers of Israel; and they presented themselves before God. 
JOS.24.2	And Joshua said to all the people, “Thus says the 
JOS.24.3	Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River and led him through all the land of Canaan, and made his offspring many. I gave him Isaac; 
JOS.24.4	and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. And I gave Esau the hill country of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt. 
JOS.24.5	And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with what I did in the midst of it; and afterwards I brought you out. 
JOS.24.6	Then I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea. 
JOS.24.7	And when they cried to the 
JOS.24.8	Then I brought you to the land of the Amorites, who lived on the other side of the Jordan; they fought with you, and I gave them into your hand, and you took possession of their land, and I destroyed them before you. 
JOS.24.9	Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel; and he sent and invited Balaam the son of Beor to curse you, 
JOS.24.10	but I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he blessed you; so I delivered you out of his hand. 
JOS.24.11	And you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho, and the men of Jericho fought against you, and also the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I gave them into your hand. 
JOS.24.12	And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out before you, the two kings of the Amorites; it was not by your sword or by your bow. 
JOS.24.13	I gave you a land on which you had not labored, and cities which you had not built, and you dwell therein; you eat the fruit of vineyards and oliveyards which you did not plant.’
JOS.24.14	“Now therefore fear the 
JOS.24.15	And if you be unwilling to serve the 
JOS.24.16	Then the people answered, “Far be it from us that we should forsake the 
JOS.24.17	for it is the 
JOS.24.18	and the 
JOS.24.19	But Joshua said to the people, “You cannot serve the 
JOS.24.20	If you forsake the 
JOS.24.21	And the people said to Joshua, “Nay; but we will serve the 
JOS.24.22	Then Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the 
JOS.24.23	He said, “Then put away the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart to the 
JOS.24.24	And the people said to Joshua, “The 
JOS.24.25	So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made statutes and ordinances for them at Shechem. 
JOS.24.26	And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak in the sanctuary of the 
JOS.24.27	And Joshua said to all the people, “Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it has heard all the words of the 
JOS.24.28	So Joshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance.
JOS.24.29	After these things Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the 
JOS.24.30	And they buried him in his own inheritance at Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, north of the mountain of Gaash.
JOS.24.31	And Israel served the 
JOS.24.33	And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him at Gibe-ah, the town of Phinehas his son, which had been given him in the hill country of Ephraim.
JDG.1.1	After the death of Joshua the people of Israel inquired of the 
JDG.1.2	The 
JDG.1.3	And Judah said to Simeon his brother, “Come up with me into the territory alloted to me, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into the territory allotted to you.” So Simeon went with him. 
JDG.1.4	Then Judah went up and the 
JDG.1.5	They came upon Adoni-bezek at Bezek, and fought against him, and defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites. 
JDG.1.6	Adoni-bezek fled; but they pursued him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes. 
JDG.1.7	And Adoni-bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and their great toes cut off used to pick up scraps under my table; as I have done, so God has requited me.” And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
JDG.1.8	And the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire. 
JDG.1.9	And afterward the men of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who dwelt in the hill country, in the Negeb, and in the lowland. 
JDG.1.11	From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir. The name of Debir was formerly Kiriath-sepher. 
JDG.1.12	And Caleb said, “He who attacks Kiriath-sepher and takes it, I will give him Achsah my daughter as wife.” 
JDG.1.13	And Othni-el the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife. 
JDG.1.14	When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field; and she alighted from her ass, and Caleb said to her, “What do you wish?” 
JDG.1.15	She said to him, “Give me a present; since you have set me in the land of the Negeb, give me also springs of water.” And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
JDG.1.16	And the descendants of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up with the people of Judah from the city of palms into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the Negeb near Arad; and they went and settled with the people. 
JDG.1.17	And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they defeated the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. So the name of the city was called Hormah. 
JDG.1.18	Judah also took Gaza with its territory, and Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory. 
JDG.1.19	And the 
JDG.1.20	 And Hebron was given to Caleb, as Moses had said; and he drove out from it the three sons of Anak. 
JDG.1.21	 But the people of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who dwelt in Jerusalem; so the Jebusites have dwelt with the people of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
JDG.1.22	The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel; and the 
JDG.1.23	And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel. (Now the name of the city was formerly Luz.) 
JDG.1.24	And the spies saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him, “Pray, show us the way into the city, and we will deal kindly with you.” 
JDG.1.25	And he showed them the way into the city; and they smote the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and all his family go. 
JDG.1.26	And the man went to the land of the Hittites and built a city, and called its name Luz; that is its name to this day.
JDG.1.28	When Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not utterly drive them out.
JDG.1.30	Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, or the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became subject to forced labor.
JDG.1.31	Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Ahlab, or of Achzib, or of Helbah, or of Aphik, or of Rehob; 
JDG.1.32	but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.
JDG.1.33	Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became subject to forced labor for them.
JDG.1.34	The Amorites pressed the Danites back into the hill country, for they did not allow them to come down to the plain; 
JDG.1.35	the Amorites persisted in dwelling in Har-heres, in Aijalon, and in Sha-albim, but the hand of the house of Joseph rested heavily upon them, and they became subject to forced labor. 
JDG.1.36	And the border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and upward.
JDG.2.1	Now the angel of the 
JDG.2.2	and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall break down their altars.’ But you have not obeyed my command. What is this you have done? 
JDG.2.3	So now I say, I will not drive them out before you; but they shall become adversaries
JDG.2.4	When the angel of the 
JDG.2.5	And they called the name of that place Bochim;
JDG.2.7	And the people served the 
JDG.2.8	And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the 
JDG.2.9	And they buried him within the bounds of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of the mountain of Gaash. 
JDG.2.10	And all that generation also were gathered to their fathers; and there arose another generation after them, who did not know the 
JDG.2.11	And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the 
JDG.2.12	and they forsook the 
JDG.2.13	They forsook the 
JDG.2.14	So the anger of the 
JDG.2.15	Whenever they marched out, the hand of the 
JDG.2.16	Then the 
JDG.2.17	And yet they did not listen to their judges; for they played the harlot after other gods and bowed down to them; they soon turned aside from the way in which their fathers had walked, who had obeyed the commandments of the 
JDG.2.18	Whenever the 
JDG.2.19	But whenever the judge died, they turned back and behaved worse than their fathers, going after other gods, serving them and bowing down to them; they did not drop any of their practices or their stubborn ways. 
JDG.2.20	So the anger of the 
JDG.2.21	I will not henceforth drive out before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died, 
JDG.2.22	that by them I may test Israel, whether they will take care to walk in the way of the 
JDG.2.23	So the 
JDG.3.1	Now these are the nations which the 
JDG.3.2	it was only that the generations of the people of Israel might know war, that he might teach war to such at least as had not known it before. 
JDG.3.3	These are the nations: the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites who dwelt on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal-hermon as far as the entrance of Hamath. 
JDG.3.4	They were for the testing of Israel, to know whether Israel would obey the commandments of the 
JDG.3.5	So the people of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; 
JDG.3.6	and they took their daughters to themselves for wives, and their own daughters they gave to their sons; and they served their gods.
JDG.3.7	And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the 
JDG.3.8	Therefore the anger of the 
JDG.3.9	But when the people of Israel cried to the 
JDG.3.10	The Spirit of the 
JDG.3.11	So the land had rest forty years. Then Othni-el the son of Kenaz died.
JDG.3.12	And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the 
JDG.3.13	He gathered to himself the Ammonites and the Amalekites, and went and defeated Israel; and they took possession of the city of palms. 
JDG.3.14	And the people of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
JDG.3.15	But when the people of Israel cried to the 
JDG.3.16	And Ehud made for himself a sword with two edges, a cubit in length; and he girded it on his right thigh under his clothes. 
JDG.3.17	And he presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man. 
JDG.3.18	And when Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people that carried the tribute. 
JDG.3.19	But he himself turned back at the sculptured stones near Gilgal, and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” And he commanded, “Silence.” And all his attendants went out from his presence. 
JDG.3.20	And Ehud came to him, as he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber. And Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you.” And he arose from his seat. 
JDG.3.21	And Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly; 
JDG.3.22	and the hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not draw the sword out of his belly; and the dirt came out. 
JDG.3.23	Then Ehud went out into the vestibule,
JDG.3.24	When he had gone, the servants came; and when they saw that the doors of the roof chamber were locked, they thought, “He is only relieving himself in the closet of the cool chamber.” 
JDG.3.25	And they waited till they were utterly at a loss; but when he still did not open the doors of the roof chamber, they took the key and opened them; and there lay their lord dead on the floor.
JDG.3.26	Ehud escaped while they delayed, and passed beyond the sculptured stones, and escaped to Se-irah. 
JDG.3.27	When he arrived, he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the people of Israel went down with him from the hill country, having him at their head. 
JDG.3.28	And he said to them, “Follow after me; for the 
JDG.3.29	And they killed at that time about ten thousand of the Moabites, all strong, able-bodied men; not a man escaped. 
JDG.3.30	So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest for eighty years.
JDG.3.31	After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who killed six hundred of the Philistines with an oxgoad; and he too delivered Israel.
JDG.4.1	And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the 
JDG.4.2	And the 
JDG.4.3	Then the people of Israel cried to the 
JDG.4.4	Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time. 
JDG.4.5	She used to sit under the palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the people of Israel came up to her for judgment. 
JDG.4.6	She sent and summoned Barak the son of Abino-am from Kedesh in Naphtali, and said to him, “The 
JDG.4.7	And I will draw out Sisera, the general of Jabin's army, to meet you by the river Kishon with his chariots and his troops; and I will give him into your hand.’ ” 
JDG.4.8	Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.” 
JDG.4.9	And she said, “I will surely go with you; nevertheless, the road on which you are going will not lead to your glory, for the 
JDG.4.10	And Barak summoned Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and ten thousand men went up at his heels; and Deborah went up with him.
JDG.4.11	Now Heber the Kenite had separated from the Kenites, the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Za-anannim, which is near Kedesh.
JDG.4.12	When Sisera was told that Barak the son of Abino-am had gone up to Mount Tabor, 
JDG.4.13	Sisera called out all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the men who were with him, from Harosheth-ha-goiim to the river Kishon. 
JDG.4.14	And Deborah said to Barak, “Up! For this is the day in which the 
JDG.4.15	And the 
JDG.4.16	And Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth-ha-goiim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not a man was left.
JDG.4.17	But Sisera fled away on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. 
JDG.4.18	And Jael came out to meet Sisera, and said to him, “Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me; have no fear.” So he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug. 
JDG.4.19	And he said to her, “Pray, give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.” So she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him. 
JDG.4.20	And he said to her, “Stand at the door of the tent, and if any man comes and asks you, ‘Is any one here?’ say, No.” 
JDG.4.21	But Jael the wife of Heber took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple, till it went down into the ground, as he was lying fast asleep from weariness. So he died. 
JDG.4.22	And behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael went out to meet him, and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking.” So he went in to her tent; and there lay Sisera dead, with the tent peg in his temple.
JDG.4.23	So on that day God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the people of Israel. 
JDG.4.24	And the hand of the people of Israel bore harder and harder on Jabin the king of Canaan, until they destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
JDG.5.1	Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abino-am on that day:
JDG.5.2	“That the leaders took the lead in Israel,
JDG.5.2	that the people offered themselves willingly,
JDG.5.2	bless
JDG.5.3	“Hear, O kings; give ear, O princes;
JDG.5.3	to the 
JDG.5.3	I will make melody to the 
JDG.5.4	“
JDG.5.4	when thou didst march from the region of Edom,
JDG.5.4	the earth trembled,
JDG.5.4	and the heavens dropped,
JDG.5.4	yea, the clouds dropped water.
JDG.5.5	The mountains quaked before the 
JDG.5.5	yon Sinai before the 
JDG.5.6	“In the days of Shamgar, son of Anath,
JDG.5.6	in the days of Jael, caravans ceased
JDG.5.6	and travelers kept to the byways.
JDG.5.7	The peasantry ceased in Israel, they ceased
JDG.5.7	until you arose, Deborah,
JDG.5.7	arose as a mother in Israel.
JDG.5.8	When new gods were chosen,
JDG.5.8	then war was in the gates.
JDG.5.8	Was shield or spear to be seen
JDG.5.8	among forty thousand in Israel?
JDG.5.9	My heart goes out to the commanders of Israel
JDG.5.9	who offered themselves willingly among the people.
JDG.5.9	Bless the 
JDG.5.10	“Tell of it, you who ride on tawny asses,
JDG.5.10	you who sit on rich carpets
JDG.5.10	and you who walk by the way.
JDG.5.11	To the sound of musicians
JDG.5.11	there they repeat the triumphs of the 
JDG.5.11	the triumphs of his peasantry in Israel.
JDG.5.11	“Then down to the gates marched the people of the 
JDG.5.12	“Awake, awake, Deborah!
JDG.5.12	Awake, awake, utter a song!
JDG.5.12	Arise, Barak, lead away your captives,
JDG.5.12	O son of Abino-am.
JDG.5.13	Then down marched the remnant of the noble;
JDG.5.13	the people of the 
JDG.5.14	From Ephraim they set out thither
JDG.5.14	following you, Benjamin, with your kinsmen;
JDG.5.14	from Machir marched down the commanders,
JDG.5.14	and from Zebulun those who bear the marshal's staff;
JDG.5.15	the princes of Issachar came with Deborah,
JDG.5.15	and Issachar faithful to Barak;
JDG.5.15	into the valley they rushed forth at his heels.
JDG.5.15	Among the clans of Reuben
JDG.5.15	there were great searchings of heart.
JDG.5.16	Why did you tarry among the sheepfolds,
JDG.5.16	to hear the piping for the flocks?
JDG.5.16	Among the clans of Reuben
JDG.5.16	there were great searchings of heart.
JDG.5.17	Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan;
JDG.5.17	and Dan, why did he abide with the ships?
JDG.5.17	Asher sat still at the coast of the sea,
JDG.5.17	settling down by his landings.
JDG.5.18	Zebulun is a people that jeoparded their lives to the death;
JDG.5.18	Naphtali too, on the heights of the field.
JDG.5.19	“The kings came, they fought;
JDG.5.19	then fought the kings of Canaan,
JDG.5.19	at Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo;
JDG.5.19	they got no spoils of silver.
JDG.5.20	From heaven fought the stars,
JDG.5.20	from their courses they fought against Sisera.
JDG.5.21	The torrent Kishon swept them away,
JDG.5.21	the onrushing torrent, the torrent Kishon.
JDG.5.21	March on, my soul, with might!
JDG.5.22	“Then loud beat the horses' hoofs
JDG.5.22	with the galloping, galloping of his steeds.
JDG.5.23	“Curse Meroz, says the angel of the 
JDG.5.23	curse bitterly its inhabitants,
JDG.5.23	because they came not to the help of the

JDG.5.25	He asked water and she gave him milk,
JDG.5.25	she brought him curds in a lordly bowl.
JDG.5.26	She put her hand to the tent peg
JDG.5.26	and her right hand to the workmen's mallet;
JDG.5.26	she struck Sisera a blow,
JDG.5.26	she crushed his head,
JDG.5.26	she shattered and pierced his temple.
JDG.5.27	He sank, he fell,
JDG.5.27	he lay still at her feet;
JDG.5.27	at her feet he sank, he fell;
JDG.5.27	where he sank, there he fell dead.
JDG.5.28	“Out of the window she peered,
JDG.5.28	the mother of Sisera gazed
JDG.5.28	‘Why is his chariot so long in coming?
JDG.5.28	Why tarry the hoofbeats of his chariots?’
JDG.5.29	Her wisest ladies make answer,
JDG.5.29	nay, she gives answer to herself,
JDG.5.30	‘Are they not finding and dividing the spoil?—
JDG.5.30	A maiden or two for every man;
JDG.5.30	spoil of dyed stuffs for Sisera,
JDG.5.30	spoil of dyed stuffs embroidered,
JDG.5.30	two pieces of dyed work embroidered for my neck as spoil?’
JDG.5.31	But thy friends be like the sun as he rises in his might.”
JDG.5.31	And the land had rest for forty years.
JDG.6.1	The people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the 
JDG.6.2	And the hand of Midian prevailed over Israel; and because of Midian the people of Israel made for themselves the dens which are in the mountains, and the caves and the strongholds. 
JDG.6.3	For whenever the Israelites put in seed the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East would come up and attack them; 
JDG.6.4	they would encamp against them and destroy the produce of the land, as far as the neighborhood of Gaza, and leave no sustenance in Israel, and no sheep or ox or ass. 
JDG.6.5	For they would come up with their cattle and their tents, coming like locusts for number; both they and their camels could not be counted; so that they wasted the land as they came in. 
JDG.6.6	And Israel was brought very low because of Midian; and the people of Israel cried for help to the 
JDG.6.7	When the people of Israel cried to the 
JDG.6.8	the 
JDG.6.9	and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians, and from the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you, and gave you their land; 
JDG.6.10	and I said to you, ‘I am the 
JDG.6.11	Now the angel of the 
JDG.6.12	And the angel of the 
JDG.6.13	And Gideon said to him, “Pray, sir, if the 
JDG.6.14	And the 
JDG.6.15	And he said to him, “Pray, Lord, how can I deliver Israel? Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family.” 
JDG.6.16	And the 
JDG.6.17	And he said to him, “If now I have found favor with thee, then show me a sign that it is thou who speakest with me. 
JDG.6.18	Do not depart from here, I pray thee, until I come to thee, and bring out my present, and set it before thee.” And he said, “I will stay till you return.”
JDG.6.19	So Gideon went into his house and prepared a kid, and unleavened cakes from an ephah of flour; the meat he put in a basket, and the broth he put in a pot, and brought them to him under the oak and presented them. 
JDG.6.20	And the angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and put them on this rock, and pour the broth over them.” And he did so. 
JDG.6.21	Then the angel of the 
JDG.6.22	Then Gideon perceived that he was the angel of the 
JDG.6.23	But the 
JDG.6.24	Then Gideon built an altar there to the 
JDG.6.25	That night the 
JDG.6.26	and build an altar to the 
JDG.6.27	So Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the 
JDG.6.28	When the men of the town rose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered upon the altar which had been built. 
JDG.6.29	And they said to one another, “Who has done this thing?” And after they had made search and inquired, they said, “Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.” 
JDG.6.30	Then the men of the town said to Joash, “Bring out your son, that he may die, for he has pulled down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah beside it.” 
JDG.6.31	But Joash said to all who were arrayed against him, “Will you contend for Baal? Or will you defend his cause? Whoever contends for him shall be put to death by morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because his altar has been pulled down.” 
JDG.6.32	Therefore on that day he was called Jerubbaal, that is to say, “Let Baal contend against him,” because he pulled down his altar.
JDG.6.33	Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East came together, and crossing the Jordan they encamped in the Valley of Jezreel. 
JDG.6.34	But the Spirit of the 
JDG.6.35	And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they too were called out to follow him. And he sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali; and they went up to meet them.
JDG.6.36	Then Gideon said to God, “If thou wilt deliver Israel by my hand, as thou hast said, 
JDG.6.37	behold, I am laying a fleece of wool on the threshing floor; if there is dew on the fleece alone, and it is dry on all the ground, then I shall know that thou wilt deliver Israel by my hand, as thou hast said.” 
JDG.6.38	And it was so. When he rose early next morning and squeezed the fleece, he wrung enough dew from the fleece to fill a bowl with water. 
JDG.6.39	Then Gideon said to God, “Let not thy anger burn against me, let me speak but this once; pray, let me make trial only this once with the fleece; pray, let it be dry only on the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew.” 
JDG.6.40	And God did so that night; for it was dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground there was dew.
JDG.7.1	Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him rose early and encamped beside the spring of Harod; and the camp of Midian was north of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
JDG.7.2	The 
JDG.7.3	Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, ‘Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return home.’ ” And Gideon tested them;
JDG.7.4	And the 
JDG.7.5	So he brought the people down to the water; and the 
JDG.7.6	And the number of those that lapped, putting their hands to their mouths, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people knelt down to drink water. 
JDG.7.7	And the 
JDG.7.8	So he took the jars of the people from their hands,
JDG.7.9	That same night the 
JDG.7.10	But if you fear to go down, go down to the camp with Purah your servant; 
JDG.7.11	and you shall hear what they say, and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp.” Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outposts of the armed men that were in the camp. 
JDG.7.12	And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the people of the East lay along the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is upon the seashore for multitude. 
JDG.7.13	When Gideon came, behold, a man was telling a dream to his comrade; and he said, “Behold, I dreamed a dream; and lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.” 
JDG.7.14	And his comrade answered, “This is no other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel; into his hand God has given Midian and all the host.”
JDG.7.15	When Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, he worshiped; and he returned to the camp of Israel, and said, “Arise; for the 
JDG.7.16	And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and put trumpets into the hands of all of them and empty jars, with torches inside the jars. 
JDG.7.17	And he said to them, “Look at me, and do likewise; when I come to the outskirts of the camp, do as I do. 
JDG.7.18	When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and shout, ‘For the 
JDG.7.19	So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just set the watch; and they blew the trumpets and smashed the jars that were in their hands. 
JDG.7.20	And the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the jars, holding in their left hands the torches, and in their right hands the trumpets to blow; and they cried, “A sword for the 
JDG.7.21	They stood every man in his place round about the camp, and all the army ran; they cried out and fled. 
JDG.7.22	When they blew the three hundred trumpets, the 
JDG.7.23	And the men of Israel were called out from Naphtali and from Asher and from all Manasseh, and they pursued after Midian.
JDG.7.24	And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Come down against the Midianites and seize the waters against them, as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan.” So all the men of Ephraim were called out, and they seized the waters as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan. 
JDG.7.25	And they took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the wine press of Zeeb, as they pursued Midian; and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.
JDG.8.1	And the men of Ephraim said to him, “What is this that you have done to us, not to call us when you went to fight with Midian?” And they upbraided him violently. 
JDG.8.2	And he said to them, “What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abi-ezer? 
JDG.8.3	God has given into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; what have I been able to do in comparison with you?” Then their anger against him was abated, when he had said this.
JDG.8.4	And Gideon came to the Jordan and passed over, he and the three hundred men who were with him, faint yet pursuing. 
JDG.8.5	So he said to the men of Succoth, “Pray, give loaves of bread to the people who follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.” 
JDG.8.6	And the officials of Succoth said, “Are Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?” 
JDG.8.7	And Gideon said, “Well then, when the 
JDG.8.8	And from there he went up to Penuel, and spoke to them in the same way; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered. 
JDG.8.9	And he said to the men of Penuel, “When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.”
JDG.8.10	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their army, about fifteen thousand men, all who were left of all the army of the people of the East; for there had fallen a hundred and twenty thousand men who drew the sword. 
JDG.8.11	And Gideon went up by the caravan route east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and attacked the army; for the army was off its guard. 
JDG.8.12	And Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he pursued them and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and he threw all the army into a panic.
JDG.8.13	Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres. 
JDG.8.14	And he caught a young man of Succoth, and questioned him; and he wrote down for him the officials and elders of Succoth, seventy-seven men. 
JDG.8.15	And he came to the men of Succoth, and said, “Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me, saying, ‘Are Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are faint?’ ” 
JDG.8.16	And he took the elders of the city and he took thorns of the wilderness and briers and with them taught the men of Succoth. 
JDG.8.17	And he broke down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.
JDG.8.18	Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “Where are the men whom you slew at Tabor?” They answered, “As you are, so were they, every one of them; they resembled the sons of a king.” 
JDG.8.19	And he said, “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother; as the 
JDG.8.20	And he said to Jether his first-born, “Rise, and slay them.” But the youth did not draw his sword; for he was afraid, because he was still a youth. 
JDG.8.21	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Rise yourself, and fall upon us; for as the man is, so is his strength.” And Gideon arose and slew Zebah and Zalmunna; and he took the crescents that were on the necks of their camels.
JDG.8.22	Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us, you and your son and your grandson also; for you have delivered us out of the hand of Midian.” 
JDG.8.23	Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; the 
JDG.8.24	And Gideon said to them, “Let me make a request of you; give me every man of you the earrings of his spoil.” (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.) 
JDG.8.25	And they answered, “We will willingly give them.” And they spread a garment, and every man cast in it the earrings of his spoil. 
JDG.8.26	And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was one thousand seven hundred shekels of gold; besides the crescents and the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian, and besides the collars that were about the necks of their camels. 
JDG.8.27	And Gideon made an ephod of it and put it in his city, in Ophrah; and all Israel played the harlot after it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and to his family. 
JDG.8.28	So Midian was subdued before the people of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.
JDG.8.29	Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house. 
JDG.8.30	Now Gideon had seventy sons, his own offspring, for he had many wives. 
JDG.8.31	And his concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, and he called his name Abimelech. 
JDG.8.32	And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, at Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
JDG.8.33	As soon as Gideon died, the people of Israel turned again and played the harlot after the Baals, and made Baal-berith their god. 
JDG.8.34	And the people of Israel did not remember the 
JDG.8.35	and they did not show kindness to the family of Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) in return for all the good that he had done to Israel.
JDG.9.1	Now Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother's kinsmen and said to them and to the whole clan of his mother's family, 
JDG.9.2	“Say in the ears of all the citizens of Shechem, ‘Which is better for you, that all seventy of the sons of Jerubbaal rule over you, or that one rule over you?’ Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.” 
JDG.9.3	And his mother's kinsmen spoke all these words on his behalf in the ears of all the men of Shechem; and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, “He is our brother.” 
JDG.9.4	And they gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless fellows, who followed him. 
JDG.9.5	And he went to his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men, upon one stone; but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, for he hid himself. 
JDG.9.6	And all the citizens of Shechem came together, and all Beth-millo, and they went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar at Shechem.
JDG.9.7	When it was told to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim, and cried aloud and said to them, “Listen to me, you men of Shechem, that God may listen to you. 
JDG.9.8	The trees once went forth to anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive tree, ‘Reign over us.’ 
JDG.9.9	But the olive tree said to them, ‘Shall I leave my fatness, by which gods and men are honored, and go to sway over the trees?’ 
JDG.9.10	And the trees said to the fig tree, ‘Come you, and reign over us.’ 
JDG.9.11	But the fig tree said to them, ‘Shall I leave my sweetness and my good fruit, and go to sway over the trees?’ 
JDG.9.12	And the trees said to the vine, ‘Come you, and reign over us.’ 
JDG.9.13	But the vine said to them, ‘Shall I leave my wine which cheers gods and men, and go to sway over the trees?’ 
JDG.9.14	Then all the trees said to the bramble, ‘Come you, and reign over us.’ 
JDG.9.15	And the bramble said to the trees, ‘If in good faith you are anointing me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon.’
JDG.9.16	“Now therefore, if you acted in good faith and honor when you made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him as his deeds deserved— 
JDG.9.17	for my father fought for you, and risked his life, and rescued you from the hand of Midian; 
JDG.9.18	and you have risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, seventy men on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the citizens of Shechem, because he is your kinsman— 
JDG.9.19	if you then have acted in good faith and honor with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you; 
JDG.9.20	but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the citizens of Shechem, and Beth-millo; and let fire come out from the citizens of Shechem, and from Beth-millo, and devour Abimelech.” 
JDG.9.21	And Jotham ran away and fled, and went to Beer and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.
JDG.9.22	Abimelech ruled over Israel three years. 
JDG.9.23	And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech; 
JDG.9.24	that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, who slew them, and upon the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to slay his brothers. 
JDG.9.25	And the men of Shechem put men in ambush against him on the mountain tops, and they robbed all who passed by them along that way; and it was told Abimelech.
JDG.9.26	And Gaal the son of Ebed moved into Shechem with his kinsmen; and the men of Shechem put confidence in him. 
JDG.9.27	And they went out into the field, and gathered the grapes from their vineyards and trod them, and held festival, and went into the house of their god, and ate and drank and reviled Abimelech. 
JDG.9.28	And Gaal the son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelech, and who are we of Shechem, that we should serve him? Did not the son of Jerubbaal and Zebul his officer serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem? Why then should we serve him? 
JDG.9.29	Would that this people were under my hand! then I would remove Abimelech. I would say
JDG.9.30	When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled. 
JDG.9.31	And he sent messengers to Abimelech at Arumah,
JDG.9.32	Now therefore, go by night, you and the men that are with you, and lie in wait in the fields. 
JDG.9.33	Then in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, rise early and rush upon the city; and when he and the men that are with him come out against you, you may do to them as occasion offers.”
JDG.9.34	And Abimelech and all the men that were with him rose up by night, and laid wait against Shechem in four companies. 
JDG.9.35	And Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city; and Abimelech and the men that were with him rose from the ambush. 
JDG.9.36	And when Gaal saw the men, he said to Zebul, “Look, men are coming down from the mountain tops!” And Zebul said to him, “You see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.” 
JDG.9.37	Gaal spoke again and said, “Look, men are coming down from the center of the land, and one company is coming from the direction of the Diviners' Oak.” 
JDG.9.38	Then Zebul said to him, “Where is your mouth now, you who said, ‘Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?’ Are not these the men whom you despised? Go out now and fight with them.” 
JDG.9.39	And Gaal went out at the head of the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech. 
JDG.9.40	And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him; and many fell wounded, up to the entrance of the gate. 
JDG.9.41	And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah; and Zebul drove out Gaal and his kinsmen, so that they could not live on at Shechem.
JDG.9.42	On the following day the men went out into the fields. And Abimelech was told. 
JDG.9.43	He took his men and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the fields; and he looked and saw the men coming out of the city, and he rose against them and slew them. 
JDG.9.44	Abimelech and the company
JDG.9.45	And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; he took the city, and killed the people that were in it; and he razed the city and sowed it with salt.
JDG.9.46	When all the people of the Tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered the stronghold of the house of El-berith. 
JDG.9.47	Abimelech was told that all the people of the Tower of Shechem were gathered together. 
JDG.9.48	And Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the men that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bundle of brushwood, and took it up and laid it on his shoulder. And he said to the men that were with him, “What you have seen me do, make haste to do, as I have done.” 
JDG.9.49	So every one of the people cut down his bundle and following Abimelech put it against the stronghold, and they set the stronghold on fire over them, so that all the people of the Tower of Shechem also died, about a thousand men and women.
JDG.9.50	Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it. 
JDG.9.51	But there was a strong tower within the city, and all the people of the city fled to it, all the men and women, and shut themselves in; and they went to the roof of the tower. 
JDG.9.52	And Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire. 
JDG.9.53	And a certain woman threw an upper millstone upon Abimelech's head, and crushed his skull. 
JDG.9.54	Then he called hastily to the young man his armor-bearer, and said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me, lest men say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’ ” And his young man thrust him through, and he died. 
JDG.9.55	And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man to his home. 
JDG.9.56	Thus God requited the crime of Abimelech, which he committed against his father in killing his seventy brothers; 
JDG.9.57	and God also made all the wickedness of the men of Shechem fall back upon their heads, and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.
JDG.10.1	After Abimelech there arose to deliver Israel Tola the son of Puah, son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he lived at Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim. 
JDG.10.2	And he judged Israel twenty-three years. Then he died, and was buried at Shamir.
JDG.10.3	After him arose Jair the Gileadite, who judged Israel twenty-two years. 
JDG.10.4	And he had thirty sons who rode on thirty asses; and they had thirty cities, called Havvoth-jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead. 
JDG.10.5	And Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.
JDG.10.6	And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the 
JDG.10.7	And the anger of the 
JDG.10.8	and they crushed and oppressed the children of Israel that year. For eighteen years they oppressed all the people of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead. 
JDG.10.9	And the Ammonites crossed the Jordan to fight also against Judah and against Benjamin and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sorely distressed.
JDG.10.10	And the people of Israel cried to the 
JDG.10.11	And the 
JDG.10.12	The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, oppressed you; and you cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand. 
JDG.10.13	Yet you have forsaken me and served other gods; therefore I will deliver you no more. 
JDG.10.14	Go and cry to the gods whom you have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your distress.” 
JDG.10.15	And the people of Israel said to the 
JDG.10.16	So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the 
JDG.10.17	Then the Ammonites were called to arms, and they encamped in Gilead; and the people of Israel came together, and they encamped at Mizpah. 
JDG.10.18	And the people, the leaders of Gilead, said one to another, “Who is the man that will begin to fight against the Ammonites? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”
JDG.11.1	Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior, but he was the son of a harlot. Gilead was the father of Jephthah. 
JDG.11.2	And Gilead's wife also bore him sons; and when his wife's sons grew up, they thrust Jephthah out, and said to him, “You shall not inherit in our father's house; for you are the son of another woman.” 
JDG.11.3	Then Jephthah fled from his brothers, and dwelt in the land of Tob; and worthless fellows collected round Jephthah, and went raiding with him.
JDG.11.4	After a time the Ammonites made war against Israel. 
JDG.11.5	And when the Ammonites made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah from the land of Tob; 
JDG.11.6	and they said to Jephthah, “Come and be our leader, that we may fight with the Ammonites.” 
JDG.11.7	But Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “Did you not hate me, and drive me out of my father's house? Why have you come to me now when you are in trouble?” 
JDG.11.8	And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “That is why we have turned to you now, that you may go with us and fight with the Ammonites, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.” 
JDG.11.9	Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “If you bring me home again to fight with the Ammonites, and the 
JDG.11.10	And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “The 
JDG.11.11	So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and leader over them; and Jephthah spoke all his words before the 
JDG.11.12	Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites and said, “What have you against me, that you have come to me to fight against my land?” 
JDG.11.13	And the king of the Ammonites answered the messengers of Jephthah, “Because Israel on coming from Egypt took away my land, from the Arnon to the Jabbok and to the Jordan; now therefore restore it peaceably.” 
JDG.11.14	And Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the Ammonites 
JDG.11.15	and said to him, “Thus says Jephthah: Israel did not take away the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites, 
JDG.11.16	but when they came up from Egypt, Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh. 
JDG.11.17	Israel then sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, ‘Let us pass, we pray, through your land’; but the king of Edom would not listen. And they sent also to the king of Moab, but he would not consent. So Israel remained at Kadesh. 
JDG.11.18	Then they journeyed through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom and the land of Moab, and arrived on the east side of the land of Moab, and camped on the other side of the Arnon; but they did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was the boundary of Moab. 
JDG.11.19	Israel then sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, ‘Let us pass, we pray, through your land to our country.’ 
JDG.11.20	But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory; so Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped at Jahaz, and fought with Israel. 
JDG.11.21	And the 
JDG.11.22	And they took possession of all the territory of the Amorites from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan. 
JDG.11.23	So then the 
JDG.11.24	Will you not possess what Chemosh your god gives you to possess? And all that the 
JDG.11.25	Now are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever go to war with them? 
JDG.11.26	While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities that are on the banks of the Arnon, three hundred years, why did you not recover them within that time? 
JDG.11.27	I therefore have not sinned against you, and you do me wrong by making war on me; the 
JDG.11.28	But the king of the Ammonites did not heed the message of Jephthah which he sent to him.
JDG.11.29	Then the Spirit of the 
JDG.11.30	And Jephthah made a vow to the 
JDG.11.31	then whoever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me, when I return victorious from the Ammonites, shall be the 
JDG.11.32	So Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites to fight against them; and the 
JDG.11.33	And he smote them from Aroer to the neighborhood of Minnith, twenty cities, and as far as Abel-keramim, with a very great slaughter. So the Ammonites were subdued before the people of Israel.
JDG.11.34	Then Jephthah came to his home at Mizpah; and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances; she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter. 
JDG.11.35	And when he saw her, he rent his clothes, and said, “Alas, my daughter! you have brought me very low, and you have become the cause of great trouble to me; for I have opened my mouth to the 
JDG.11.36	And she said to him, “My father, if you have opened your mouth to the 
JDG.11.37	And she said to her father, “Let this thing be done for me; let me alone two months, that I may go and wander
JDG.11.38	And he said, “Go.” And he sent her away for two months; and she departed, she and her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains. 
JDG.11.39	And at the end of two months, she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had made. She had never known a man. And it became a custom in Israel 
JDG.11.40	that the daughters of Israel went year by year to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year.
JDG.12.1	The men of Ephraim were called to arms, and they crossed to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, “Why did you cross over to fight against the Ammonites, and did not call us to go with you? We will burn your house over you with fire.” 
JDG.12.2	And Jephthah said to them, “I and my people had a great feud with the Ammonites; and when I called you, you did not deliver me from their hand. 
JDG.12.3	And when I saw that you would not deliver me, I took my life in my hand, and crossed over against the Ammonites, and the 
JDG.12.4	Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, “You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim and Manasseh.” 
JDG.12.5	And the Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. And when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said, “Let me go over,” the men of Gilead said to him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” When he said, “No,” 
JDG.12.6	they said to him, “Then say Shibboleth,” and he said, “Sibboleth,” for he could not pronounce it right; then they seized him and slew him at the fords of the Jordan. And there fell at that time forty-two thousand of the Ephraimites.
JDG.12.7	Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died, and was buried in his city in Gilead.
JDG.12.8	After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. 
JDG.12.9	He had thirty sons; and thirty daughters he gave in marriage outside his clan, and thirty daughters he brought in from outside for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years. 
JDG.12.10	Then Ibzan died, and was buried at Bethlehem.
JDG.12.11	After him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years. 
JDG.12.12	Then Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried at Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
JDG.12.13	After him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel. 
JDG.12.14	He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy asses; and he judged Israel eight years. 
JDG.12.15	Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried at Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
JDG.13.1	And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the 
JDG.13.2	And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the tribe of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren and had no children. 
JDG.13.3	And the angel of the 
JDG.13.4	 Therefore beware, and drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean, 
JDG.13.5	for lo, you shall conceive and bear a son. No razor shall come upon his head, for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from birth; and he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines.” 
JDG.13.6	Then the woman came and told her husband, “A man of God came to me, and his countenance was like the countenance of the angel of God, very terrible; I did not ask him whence he was, and he did not tell me his name; 
JDG.13.7	but he said to me, ‘Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son; so then drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean, for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from birth to the day of his death.’ ”
JDG.13.8	Then Manoah entreated the 
JDG.13.9	And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field; but Manoah her husband was not with her. 
JDG.13.10	And the woman ran in haste and told her husband, “Behold, the man who came to me the other day has appeared to me.” 
JDG.13.11	And Manoah arose and went after his wife, and came to the man and said to him, “Are you the man who spoke to this woman?” And he said, “I am.” 
JDG.13.12	And Manoah said, “Now when your words come true, what is to be the boy's manner of life, and what is he to do?” 
JDG.13.13	And the angel of the 
JDG.13.14	She may not eat of anything that comes from the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.”
JDG.13.15	Manoah said to the angel of the 
JDG.13.16	And the angel of the 
JDG.13.17	And Manoah said to the angel of the 
JDG.13.18	And the angel of the 
JDG.13.19	So Manoah took the kid with the cereal offering, and offered it upon the rock to the 
JDG.13.20	And when the flame went up toward heaven from the altar, the angel of the 
JDG.13.21	The angel of the 
JDG.13.22	And Manoah said to his wife, “We shall surely die, for we have seen God.” 
JDG.13.23	But his wife said to him, “If the 
JDG.13.24	 And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson; and the boy grew, and the 
JDG.13.25	And the Spirit of the 
JDG.14.1	Samson went down to Timnah, and at Timnah he saw one of the daughters of the Philistines. 
JDG.14.2	Then he came up, and told his father and mother, “I saw one of the daughters of the Philistines at Timnah; now get her for me as my wife.” 
JDG.14.3	But his father and mother said to him, “Is there not a woman among the daughters of your kinsmen, or among all our people, that you must go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?” But Samson said to his father, “Get her for me; for she pleases me well.”
JDG.14.4	His father and mother did not know that it was from the 
JDG.14.5	Then Samson went down with his father and mother to Timnah, and he came to the vineyards of Timnah. And behold, a young lion roared against him; 
JDG.14.6	and the Spirit of the 
JDG.14.7	Then he went down and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well. 
JDG.14.8	And after a while he returned to take her; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion, and behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey. 
JDG.14.9	He scraped it out into his hands, and went on, eating as he went; and he came to his father and mother, and gave some to them, and they ate. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the carcass of the lion.
JDG.14.10	And his father went down to the woman, and Samson made a feast there; for so the young men used to do. 
JDG.14.11	And when the people saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him. 
JDG.14.12	And Samson said to them, “Let me now put a riddle to you; if you can tell me what it is, within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty festal garments; 
JDG.14.13	but if you cannot tell me what it is, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty festal garments.” And they said to him, “Put your riddle, that we may hear it.” 
JDG.14.14	And he said to them,
JDG.14.14	“Out of the eater came something to eat.
JDG.14.14	Out of the strong came something sweet.”
JDG.14.14	And they could not in three days tell what the riddle was.
JDG.14.15	On the fourth
JDG.14.16	And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, “You only hate me, you do not love me; you have put a riddle to my countrymen, and you have not told me what it is.” And he said to her, “Behold, I have not told my father nor my mother, and shall I tell you?” 
JDG.14.17	She wept before him the seven days that their feast lasted; and on the seventh day he told her, because she pressed him hard. Then she told the riddle to her countrymen. 
JDG.14.18	And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down,
JDG.14.18	“What is sweeter than honey?
JDG.14.18	What is stronger than a lion?”
JDG.14.18	And he said to them,
JDG.14.18	“If you had not plowed with my heifer,
JDG.14.18	you would not have found out my riddle.”
JDG.14.19	And the Spirit of the 
JDG.14.20	And Samson's wife was given to his companion, who had been his best man.
JDG.15.1	After a while, at the time of wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife with a kid; and he said, “I will go in to my wife in the chamber.” But her father would not allow him to go in. 
JDG.15.2	And her father said, “I really thought that you utterly hated her; so I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister fairer than she? Pray take her instead.” 
JDG.15.3	And Samson said to them, “This time I shall be blameless in regard to the Philistines, when I do them mischief.” 
JDG.15.4	So Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches; and he turned them tail to tail, and put a torch between each pair of tails. 
JDG.15.5	And when he had set fire to the torches, he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burned up the shocks and the standing grain, as well as the olive orchards. 
JDG.15.6	Then the Philistines said, “Who has done this?” And they said, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion.” And the Philistines came up, and burned her and her father with fire. 
JDG.15.7	And Samson said to them, “If this is what you do, I swear I will be avenged upon you, and after that I will quit.” 
JDG.15.8	And he smote them hip and thigh with great slaughter; and he went down and stayed in the cleft of the rock of Etam.
JDG.15.9	Then the Philistines came up and encamped in Judah, and made a raid on Lehi. 
JDG.15.10	And the men of Judah said, “Why have you come up against us?” They said, “We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he did to us.” 
JDG.15.11	Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, “Do you not know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?” And he said to them, “As they did to me, so have I done to them.” 
JDG.15.12	And they said to him, “We have come down to bind you, that we may give you into the hands of the Philistines.” And Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you will not fall upon me yourselves.” 
JDG.15.13	They said to him, “No; we will only bind you and give you into their hands; we will not kill you.” So they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.
JDG.15.14	When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him; and the Spirit of the 
JDG.15.15	And he found a fresh jawbone of an ass, and put out his hand and seized it, and with it he slew a thousand men. 
JDG.15.16	And Samson said,
JDG.15.16	“With the jawbone of an ass,
JDG.15.16	heaps upon heaps,
JDG.15.16	with the jawbone of an ass
JDG.15.16	have I slain a thousand men.”
JDG.15.17	When he had finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was called Ramath-lehi.
JDG.15.18	And he was very thirsty, and he called on the 
JDG.15.19	And God split open the hollow place that is at Lehi, and there came water from it; and when he drank, his spirit returned, and he revived. Therefore the name of it was called En-hakkore;
JDG.15.20	And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
JDG.16.1	Samson went to Gaza, and there he saw a harlot, and he went in to her. 
JDG.16.2	The Gazites were told, “Samson has come here,” and they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the gate of the city. They kept quiet all night, saying, “Let us wait till the light of the morning; then we will kill him.” 
JDG.16.3	But Samson lay till midnight, and at midnight he arose and took hold of the doors of the gate of the city and the two posts, and pulled them up, bar and all, and put them on his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that is before Hebron.
JDG.16.4	After this he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. 
JDG.16.5	And the lords of the Philistines came to her and said to her, “Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lies, and by what means we may overpower him, that we may bind him to subdue him; and we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.” 
JDG.16.6	And Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me wherein your great strength lies, and how you might be bound, that one could subdue you.” 
JDG.16.7	And Samson said to her, “If they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings which have not been dried, then I shall become weak, and be like any other man.” 
JDG.16.8	Then the lords of the Philistines brought her seven fresh bowstrings which had not been dried, and she bound him with them. 
JDG.16.9	Now she had men lying in wait in an inner chamber. And she said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” But he snapped the bowstrings, as a string of tow snaps when it touches the fire. So the secret of his strength was not known.
JDG.16.10	And Delilah said to Samson, “Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies; please tell me how you might be bound.” 
JDG.16.11	And he said to her, “If they bind me with new ropes that have not been used, then I shall become weak, and be like any other man.” 
JDG.16.12	So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them, and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” And the men lying in wait were in an inner chamber. But he snapped the ropes off his arms like a thread.
JDG.16.13	And Delilah said to Samson, “Until now you have mocked me, and told me lies; tell me how you might be bound.” And he said to her, “If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web and make it tight with the pin, then I shall become weak, and be like any other man.” 
JDG.16.14	So while he slept, Delilah took the seven locks of his head and wove them into the web.
JDG.16.15	And she said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and you have not told me wherein your great strength lies.” 
JDG.16.16	And when she pressed him hard with her words day after day, and urged him, his soul was vexed to death. 
JDG.16.17	And he told her all his mind, and said to her, “A razor has never come upon my head; for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother's womb. If I be shaved, then my strength will leave me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.”
JDG.16.18	When Delilah saw that he had told her all his mind, she sent and called the lords of the Philistines, saying, “Come up this once, for he has told me all his mind.” Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and brought the money in their hands. 
JDG.16.19	She made him sleep upon her knees; and she called a man, and had him shave off the seven locks of his head. Then she began to torment him, and his strength left him. 
JDG.16.20	And she said, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” And he awoke from his sleep, and said, “I will go out as at other times, and shake myself free.” And he did not know that the 
JDG.16.21	And the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with bronze fetters; and he ground at the mill in the prison. 
JDG.16.22	But the hair of his head began to grow again after it had been shaved.
JDG.16.23	Now the lords of the Philistines gathered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice; for they said, “Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hand.” 
JDG.16.24	And when the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said, “Our god has given our enemy into our hand, the ravager of our country, who has slain many of us.” 
JDG.16.25	And when their hearts were merry, they said, “Call Samson, that he may make sport for us.” So they called Samson out of the prison, and he made sport before them. They made him stand between the pillars; 
JDG.16.26	and Samson said to the lad who held him by the hand, “Let me feel the pillars on which the house rests, that I may lean against them.” 
JDG.16.27	Now the house was full of men and women; all the lords of the Philistines were there, and on the roof there were about three thousand men and women, who looked on while Samson made sport.
JDG.16.28	Then Samson called to the 
JDG.16.29	And Samson grasped the two middle pillars upon which the house rested, and he leaned his weight upon them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other. 
JDG.16.30	And Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines.” Then he bowed with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people that were in it. So the dead whom he slew at his death were more than those whom he had slain during his life. 
JDG.16.31	Then his brothers and all his family came down and took him and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshta-ol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had judged Israel twenty years.
JDG.17.1	There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah. 
JDG.17.2	And he said to his mother, “The eleven hundred pieces of silver which were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.” And his mother said, “Blessed be my son by the 
JDG.17.3	And he restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother; and his mother said, “I consecrate the silver to the 
JDG.17.4	So when he restored the money to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave it to the silversmith, who made it into a graven image and a molten image; and it was in the house of Micah. 
JDG.17.5	And the man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and teraphim, and installed one of his sons, who became his priest. 
JDG.17.6	In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.
JDG.17.7	Now there was a young man of Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he sojourned there. 
JDG.17.8	And the man departed from the town of Bethlehem in Judah, to live where he could find a place; and as he journeyed, he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah. 
JDG.17.9	And Micah said to him, “From where do you come?” And he said to him, “I am a Levite of Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to sojourn where I may find a place.” 
JDG.17.10	And Micah said to him, “Stay with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year, and a suit of apparel, and your living.”
JDG.17.11	And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man became to him like one of his sons. 
JDG.17.12	And Micah installed the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. 
JDG.17.13	Then Micah said, “Now I know that the 
JDG.18.1	In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking for itself an inheritance to dwell in; for until then no inheritance among the tribes of Israel had fallen to them. 
JDG.18.2	So the Danites sent five able men from the whole number of their tribe, from Zorah and from Eshta-ol, to spy out the land and to explore it; and they said to them, “Go and explore the land.” And they came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there. 
JDG.18.3	When they were by the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young Levite; and they turned aside and said to him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What is your business here?” 
JDG.18.4	And he said to them, “Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me: he has hired me, and I have become his priest.” 
JDG.18.5	And they said to him, “Inquire of God, we pray thee, that we may know whether the journey on which we are setting out will succeed.” 
JDG.18.6	And the priest said to them, “Go in peace. The journey on which you go is under the eye of the 
JDG.18.8	And when they came to their brethren at Zorah and Eshta-ol, their brethren said to them, “What do you report?” 
JDG.18.9	They said, “Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very fertile. And will you do nothing? Do not be slow to go, and enter in and possess the land. 
JDG.18.10	When you go, you will come to an unsuspecting people. The land is broad; yea, God has given it into your hands, a place where there is no lack of anything that is in the earth.”
JDG.18.11	And six hundred men of the tribe of Dan, armed with weapons of war, set forth from Zorah and Eshta-ol, 
JDG.18.12	and went up and encamped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. On this account that place is called Mahaneh-dan
JDG.18.13	And they passed on from there to the hill country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.
JDG.18.14	Then the five men who had gone to spy out the country of Laish said to their brethren, “Do you know that in these houses there are an ephod, teraphim, a graven image, and a molten image? Now therefore consider what you will do.” 
JDG.18.15	And they turned aside thither, and came to the house of the young Levite, at the home of Micah, and asked him of his welfare. 
JDG.18.16	Now the six hundred men of the Danites, armed with their weapons of war, stood by the entrance of the gate; 
JDG.18.17	and the five men who had gone to spy out the land went up, and entered and took the graven image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image, while the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war. 
JDG.18.18	And when these went into Micah's house and took the graven image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?” 
JDG.18.19	And they said to him, “Keep quiet, put your hand upon your mouth, and come with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and family in Israel?” 
JDG.18.20	And the priest's heart was glad; he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.
JDG.18.21	So they turned and departed, putting the little ones and the cattle and the goods in front of them. 
JDG.18.22	When they were a good way from the home of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah's house were called out, and they overtook the Danites. 
JDG.18.23	And they shouted to the Danites, who turned round and said to Micah, “What ails you that you come with such a company?” 
JDG.18.24	And he said, “You take my gods which I made, and the priest, and go away, and what have I left? How then do you ask me, ‘What ails you?’ ” 
JDG.18.25	And the Danites said to him, “Do not let your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and you lose your life with the lives of your household.” 
JDG.18.26	Then the Danites went their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his home.
JDG.18.27	And taking what Micah had made, and the priest who belonged to him, the Danites came to Laish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and burned the city with fire. 
JDG.18.28	And there was no deliverer because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with any one. It was in the valley which belongs to Beth-rehob. And they rebuilt the city, and dwelt in it. 
JDG.18.29	And they named the city Dan, after the name of Dan their ancestor, who was born to Israel; but the name of the city was Laish at the first. 
JDG.18.30	And the Danites set up the graven image for themselves; and Jonathan the son of Gershom, son of Moses,
JDG.18.31	So they set up Micah's graven image which he made, as long as the house of God was at Shiloh.
JDG.19.1	In those days, when there was no king in Israel, a certain Levite was sojourning in the remote parts of the hill country of Ephraim, who took to himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah. 
JDG.19.2	And his concubine became angry with
JDG.19.3	Then her husband arose and went after her, to speak kindly to her and bring her back. He had with him his servant and a couple of asses. And he came
JDG.19.4	And his father-in-law, the girl's father, made him stay, and he remained with him three days; so they ate and drank, and lodged there. 
JDG.19.5	And on the fourth day they arose early in the morning, and he prepared to go; but the girl's father said to his son-in-law, “Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and after that you may go.” 
JDG.19.6	So the two men sat and ate and drank together; and the girl's father said to the man, “Be pleased to spend the night, and let your heart be merry.” 
JDG.19.7	And when the man rose up to go, his father-in-law urged him, till he lodged there again. 
JDG.19.8	And on the fifth day he arose early in the morning to depart; and the girl's father said, “Strengthen your heart, and tarry until the day declines.” So they ate, both of them. 
JDG.19.9	And when the man and his concubine and his servant rose up to depart, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said to him, “Behold, now the day has waned toward evening; pray tarry all night. Behold, the day draws to its close; lodge here and let your heart be merry; and tomorrow you shall arise early in the morning for your journey, and go home.”
JDG.19.10	But the man would not spend the night; he rose up and departed, and arrived opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). He had with him a couple of saddled asses, and his concubine was with him. 
JDG.19.11	When they were near Jebus, the day was far spent, and the servant said to his master, “Come now, let us turn aside to this city of the Jebusites, and spend the night in it.” 
JDG.19.12	And his master said to him, “We will not turn aside into the city of foreigners, who do not belong to the people of Israel; but we will pass on to Gibe-ah.” 
JDG.19.13	And he said to his servant, “Come and let us draw near to one of these places, and spend the night at Gibe-ah or at Ramah.” 
JDG.19.14	So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down on them near Gibe-ah, which belongs to Benjamin, 
JDG.19.15	and they turned aside there, to go in and spend the night at Gibe-ah. And he went in and sat down in the open square of the city; for no man took them into his house to spend the night.
JDG.19.16	And behold, an old man was coming from his work in the field at evening; the man was from the hill country of Ephraim, and he was sojourning in Gibe-ah; the men of the place were Benjaminites. 
JDG.19.17	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfarer in the open square of the city; and the old man said, “Where are you going? and whence do you come?” 
JDG.19.18	And he said to him, “We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote parts of the hill country of Ephraim, from which I come. I went to Bethlehem in Judah; and I am going to my home;
JDG.19.19	We have straw and provender for our asses, with bread and wine for me and your maidservant and the young man with your servants; there is no lack of anything.” 
JDG.19.20	And the old man said, “Peace be to you; I will care for all your wants; only, do not spend the night in the square.” 
JDG.19.21	So he brought him into his house, and gave the asses provender; and they washed their feet, and ate and drank.
JDG.19.22	As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, base fellows, beset the house round about, beating on the door; and they said to the old man, the master of the house, “Bring out the man who came into your house, that we may know him.” 
JDG.19.23	And the man, the master of the house, went out to them and said to them, “No, my brethren, do not act so wickedly; seeing that this man has come into my house, do not do this vile thing. 
JDG.19.24	Behold, here are my virgin daughter and his concubine; let me bring them out now. Ravish them and do with them what seems good to you; but against this man do not do so vile a thing.” 
JDG.19.25	But the men would not listen to him. So the man seized his concubine, and put her out to them; and they knew her, and abused her all night until the morning. And as the dawn began to break, they let her go. 
JDG.19.26	And as morning appeared, the woman came and fell down at the door of the man's house where her master was, till it was light.
JDG.19.27	And her master rose up in the morning, and when he opened the doors of the house and went out to go on his way, behold, there was his concubine lying at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold. 
JDG.19.28	He said to her, “Get up, let us be going.” But there was no answer. Then he put her upon the ass; and the man rose up and went away to his home. 
JDG.19.29	And when he entered his house, he took a knife, and laying hold of his concubine he divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel. 
JDG.19.30	And all who saw it said, “Such a thing has never happened or been seen from the day that the people of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt until this day; consider it, take counsel, and speak.”
JDG.20.1	Then all the people of Israel came out, from Dan to Beer-sheba, including the land of Gilead, and the congregation assembled as one man to the 
JDG.20.2	And the chiefs of all the people, of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand men on foot that drew the sword. 
JDG.20.3	(Now the Benjaminites heard that the people of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) And the people of Israel said, “Tell us, how was this wickedness brought to pass?” 
JDG.20.4	And the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said, “I came to Gibe-ah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to spend the night. 
JDG.20.5	And the men of Gibe-ah rose against me, and beset the house round about me by night; they meant to kill me, and they ravished my concubine, and she is dead. 
JDG.20.6	And I took my concubine and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed abomination and wantonness in Israel. 
JDG.20.7	Behold, you people of Israel, all of you, give your advice and counsel here.”
JDG.20.8	And all the people arose as one man, saying, “We will not any of us go to his tent, and none of us will return to his house. 
JDG.20.9	But now this is what we will do to Gibe-ah: we will go up against it by lot, 
JDG.20.10	and we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand of ten thousand, to bring provisions for the people, that when they come they may requite Gibe-ah of Benjamin, for all the wanton crime which they have committed in Israel.” 
JDG.20.11	So all the men of Israel gathered against the city, united as one man.
JDG.20.12	And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What wickedness is this that has taken place among you? 
JDG.20.13	Now therefore give up the men, the base fellows in Gibe-ah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel.” But the Benjaminites would not listen to the voice of their brethren, the people of Israel. 
JDG.20.14	And the Benjaminites came together out of the cities to Gibe-ah, to go out to battle against the people of Israel. 
JDG.20.15	And the Benjaminites mustered out of their cities on that day twenty-six thousand men that drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibe-ah, who mustered seven hundred picked men. 
JDG.20.16	Among all these were seven hundred picked men who were left-handed; every one could sling a stone at a hair, and not miss. 
JDG.20.17	And the men of Israel, apart from Benjamin, mustered four hundred thousand men that drew sword; all these were men of war.
JDG.20.18	The people of Israel arose and went up to Bethel, and inquired of God, “Which of us shall go up first to battle against the Benjaminites?” And the 
JDG.20.19	Then the people of Israel rose in the morning, and encamped against Gibe-ah. 
JDG.20.20	And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel drew up the battle line against them at Gibe-ah. 
JDG.20.21	The Benjaminites came out of Gibe-ah, and felled to the ground on that day twenty-two thousand men of the Israelites. 
JDG.20.22	But the people, the men of Israel, took courage, and again formed the battle line in the same place where they had formed it on the first day. 
JDG.20.23	And the people of Israel went up and wept before the 
JDG.20.24	So the people of Israel came near against the Benjamnites the second day. 
JDG.20.25	And Benjamin went against them out of Gibe-ah the second day, and felled to the ground eighteen thousand men of the people of Israel; all these were men who drew the sword. 
JDG.20.26	Then all the people of Israel, the whole army, went up and came to Bethel and wept; they sat there before the 
JDG.20.27	And the people of Israel inquired of the 
JDG.20.28	and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, ministered before it in those days), saying, “Shall we yet again go out to battle against our brethren the Benjaminites, or shall we cease?” And the 
JDG.20.29	So Israel set men in ambush round about Gibe-ah. 
JDG.20.30	And the people of Israel went up against the Benjaminites on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibe-ah, as at other times. 
JDG.20.31	And the Benjaminites went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and as at other times they began to smite and kill some of the people, in the highways, one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibe-ah, and in the open country, about thirty men of Israel. 
JDG.20.32	And the Benjaminites said, “They are routed before us, as at the first.” But the men of Israel said, “Let us flee, and draw them away from the city to the highways.” 
JDG.20.33	And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal-tamar; and the men of Israel who were in ambush rushed out of their place west
JDG.20.34	And there came against Gibe-ah ten thousand picked men out of all Israel, and the battle was hard; but the Benjaminites did not know that disaster was close upon them. 
JDG.20.35	And the 
JDG.20.36	So the Benjaminites saw that they were defeated.
JDG.20.36	The men of Israel gave ground to Benjamin, because they trusted to the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibe-ah. 
JDG.20.37	And the men in ambush made haste and rushed upon Gibe-ah; the men in ambush moved out and smote all the city with the edge of the sword. 
JDG.20.38	Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in ambush was that when they made a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city 
JDG.20.39	the men of Israel should turn in battle. Now Benjamin had begun to smite and kill about thirty men of Israel; they said, “Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.” 
JDG.20.40	But when the signal began to rise out of the city in a column of smoke, the Benjaminites looked behind them; and behold, the whole of the city went up in smoke to heaven. 
JDG.20.41	Then the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed, for they saw that disaster was close upon them. 
JDG.20.42	Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel in the direction of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them, and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst of them. 
JDG.20.43	Cutting down
JDG.20.44	Eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell, all of them men of valor. 
JDG.20.45	And they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon; five thousand men of them were cut down in the highways, and they were pursued hard to Gidom, and two thousand men of them were slain. 
JDG.20.46	So all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men that drew the sword, all of them men of valor. 
JDG.20.47	But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and abode at the rock of Rimmon four months. 
JDG.20.48	And the men of Israel turned back against the Benjaminites, and smote them with the edge of the sword, men and beasts and all that they found. And all the towns which they found they set on fire.
JDG.21.1	Now the men of Israel had sworn at Mizpah, “No one of us shall give his daughter in marriage to Benjamin.” 
JDG.21.2	And the people came to Bethel, and sat there till evening before God, and they lifted up their voices and wept bitterly. 
JDG.21.3	And they said, “O 
JDG.21.4	And on the morrow the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. 
JDG.21.5	And the people of Israel said, “Which of all the tribes of Israel did not come up in the assembly to the 
JDG.21.6	And the people of Israel had compassion for Benjamin their brother, and said, “One tribe is cut off from Israel this day. 
JDG.21.7	What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since we have sworn by the 
JDG.21.8	And they said, “What one is there of the tribes of Israel that did not come up to the 
JDG.21.9	For when the people were mustered, behold, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead was there. 
JDG.21.10	So the congregation sent thither twelve thousand of their bravest men, and commanded them, “Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword; also the women and the little ones. 
JDG.21.11	This is what you shall do; every male and every woman that has lain with a male you shall utterly destroy.” 
JDG.21.12	And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
JDG.21.13	Then the whole congregation sent word to the Benjaminites who were at the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them. 
JDG.21.14	And Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead; but they did not suffice for them. 
JDG.21.15	And the people had compassion on Benjamin because the 
JDG.21.16	Then the elders of the congregation said, “What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?” 
JDG.21.17	And they said, “There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, that a tribe be not blotted out from Israel. 
JDG.21.18	Yet we cannot give them wives of our daughters.” For the people of Israel had sworn, “Cursed be he who gives a wife to Benjamin.” 
JDG.21.19	So they said, “Behold, there is the yearly feast of the 
JDG.21.20	And they commanded the Benjaminites, saying, “Go and lie in wait in the vineyards, 
JDG.21.21	and watch; if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come out of the vineyards and seize each man his wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin. 
JDG.21.22	And when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, we will say to them, ‘Grant them graciously to us; because we did not take for each man of them his wife in battle, neither did you give them to them, else you would now be guilty.’ ” 
JDG.21.23	And the Benjaminites did so, and took their wives, according to their number, from the dancers whom they carried off; then they went and returned to their inheritance, and rebuilt the towns, and dwelt in them. 
JDG.21.24	And the people of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family, and they went out from there every man to his inheritance.
JDG.21.25	In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.
RUT.1.1	In the days when the judges ruled there was a famine in the land, and a certain man of Bethlehem in Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons. 
RUT.1.2	The name of the man was Elimelech and the name of his wife Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion; they were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They went into the country of Moab and remained there. 
RUT.1.3	But Elimelech, the husband of Naomi, died, and she was left with her two sons. 
RUT.1.4	These took Moabite wives; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth. They lived there about ten years; 
RUT.1.5	and both Mahlon and Chilion died, so that the woman was bereft of her two sons and her husband.
RUT.1.6	Then she started with her daughters-in-law to return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that the 
RUT.1.7	So she set out from the place where she was, with her two daughters-in-law, and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah. 
RUT.1.8	But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go, return each of you to her mother's house. May the 
RUT.1.9	The 
RUT.1.10	And they said to her, “No, we will return with you to your people.” 
RUT.1.11	But Naomi said, “Turn back, my daughters, why will you go with me? Have I yet sons in my womb that they may become your husbands? 
RUT.1.12	Turn back, my daughters, go your way, for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say I have hope, even if I should have a husband this night and should bear sons, 
RUT.1.13	would you therefore wait till they were grown? Would you therefore refrain from marrying? No, my daughters, for it is exceedingly bitter to me for your sake that the hand of the 
RUT.1.14	Then they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.
RUT.1.15	And she said, “See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law.” 
RUT.1.16	But Ruth said, “Entreat me not to leave you or to return from following you; for where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God; 
RUT.1.17	where you die I will die, and there will I be buried. May the 
RUT.1.18	And when Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more.
RUT.1.19	So the two of them went on until they came to Bethlehem. And when they came to Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them; and the women said, “Is this Naomi?” 
RUT.1.20	She said to them, “Do not call me Naomi,
RUT.1.21	I went away full, and the 
RUT.1.22	So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the country of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest.
RUT.2.1	Now Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz. 
RUT.2.2	And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Let me go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor.” And she said to her, “Go, my daughter.” 
RUT.2.3	So she set forth and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. 
RUT.2.4	And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem; and he said to the reapers, “The 
RUT.2.5	Then Boaz said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers, “Whose maiden is this?” 
RUT.2.6	And the servant who was in charge of the reapers answered, “It is the Moabite maiden, who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab. 
RUT.2.7	She said, ‘Pray, let me glean and gather among the sheaves after the reapers.’ So she came, and she has continued from early morning until now, without resting even for a moment.”
RUT.2.8	Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Now, listen, my daughter, do not go to glean in another field or leave this one, but keep close to my maidens. 
RUT.2.9	Let your eyes be upon the field which they are reaping, and go after them. Have I not charged the young men not to molest you? And when you are thirsty, go to the vessels and drink what the young men have drawn.” 
RUT.2.10	Then she fell on her face, bowing to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, when I am a foreigner?” 
RUT.2.11	But Boaz answered her, “All that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband has been fully told me, and how you left your father and mother and your native land and came to a people that you did not know before. 
RUT.2.12	The 
RUT.2.13	Then she said, “You are most gracious to me, my lord, for you have comforted me and spoken kindly to your maidservant, though I am not one of your maidservants.”
RUT.2.14	And at mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come here, and eat some bread, and dip your morsel in the wine.” So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed to her parched grain; and she ate until she was satisfied, and she had some left over. 
RUT.2.15	When she rose to glean, Boaz instructed his young men, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not reproach her. 
RUT.2.16	And also pull out some from the bundles for her, and leave it for her to glean, and do not rebuke her.”
RUT.2.17	So she gleaned in the field until evening; then she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley. 
RUT.2.18	And she took it up and went into the city; she showed her mother-in-law what she had gleaned, and she also brought out and gave her what food she had left over after being satisfied. 
RUT.2.19	And her mother-in-law said to her, “Where did you glean today? And where have you worked? Blessed be the man who took notice of you.” So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, “The man's name with whom I worked today is Boaz.” 
RUT.2.20	And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “Blessed be he by the 
RUT.2.21	And Ruth the Moabitess said, “Besides, he said to me, ‘You shall keep close by my servants, till they have finished all my harvest.’ ” 
RUT.2.22	And Naomi said to Ruth, her daughter-in-law, “It is well, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, lest in another field you be molested.” 
RUT.2.23	So she kept close to the maidens of Boaz, gleaning until the end of the barley and wheat harvests; and she lived with her mother-in-law.
RUT.3.1	Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, “My daughter, should I not seek a home for you, that it may be well with you? 
RUT.3.2	Now is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens you were? See, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor. 
RUT.3.3	Wash therefore and anoint yourself, and put on your best clothes and go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking. 
RUT.3.4	But when he lies down, observe the place where he lies; then, go and uncover his feet and lie down; and he will tell you what to do.” 
RUT.3.5	And she replied, “All that you say I will do.”
RUT.3.6	So she went down to the threshing floor and did just as her mother-in-law had told her. 
RUT.3.7	And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and lay down. 
RUT.3.8	At midnight the man was startled, and turned over, and behold, a woman lay at his feet! 
RUT.3.9	He said, “Who are you?” And she answered, “I am Ruth, your maidservant; spread your skirt over your maidservant, for you are next of kin.” 
RUT.3.10	And he said, “May you be blessed by the 
RUT.3.11	And now, my daughter, do not fear, I will do for you all that you ask, for all my fellow townsmen know that you are a woman of worth. 
RUT.3.12	And now it is true that I am a near kinsman, yet there is a kinsman nearer than I. 
RUT.3.13	Remain this night, and in the morning, if he will do the part of the next of kin for you, well; let him do it; but if he is not willing to do the part of the next of kin for you, then, as the 
RUT.3.14	So she lay at his feet until the morning, but arose before one could recognize another; and he said, “Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.” 
RUT.3.15	And he said, “Bring the mantle you are wearing and hold it out.” So she held it, and he measured out six measures of barley, and laid it upon her; then she went into the city. 
RUT.3.16	And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, “How did you fare, my daughter?” Then she told her all that the man had done for her, 
RUT.3.17	saying, “These six measures of barley he gave to me, for he said, ‘You must not go back empty-handed to your mother-in-law.’ ” 
RUT.3.18	She replied, “Wait, my daughter, until you learn how the matter turns out, for the man will not rest, but will settle the matter today.”
RUT.4.1	And Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there; and behold, the next of kin, of whom Boaz had spoken, came by. So Boaz said, “Turn aside, friend; sit down here”; and he turned aside and sat down. 
RUT.4.2	And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, “Sit down here”; so they sat down. 
RUT.4.3	Then he said to the next of kin, “Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land which belonged to our kinsman Elimelech. 
RUT.4.4	So I thought I would tell you of it, and say, Buy it in the presence of those sitting here, and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not, tell me, that I may know, for there is no one besides you to redeem it, and I come after you.” And he said, “I will redeem it.” 
RUT.4.5	Then Boaz said, “The day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you are also buying Ruth
RUT.4.6	Then the next of kin said, “I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I impair my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption yourself, for I cannot redeem it.”
RUT.4.8	So when the next of kin said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself,” he drew off his sandal. 
RUT.4.9	Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You are witnesses this day that I have bought from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and to Mahlon. 
RUT.4.10	Also Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, I have bought to be my wife, to perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brethren and from the gate of his native place; you are witnesses this day.” 
RUT.4.11	Then all the people who were at the gate, and the elders, said, “We are witnesses. May the 
RUT.4.12	and may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the children that the 
RUT.4.13	So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and the 
RUT.4.14	Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the 
RUT.4.15	He shall be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age; for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is more to you than seven sons, has borne him.” 
RUT.4.16	Then Naomi took the child and laid him in her bosom, and became his nurse. 
RUT.4.17	And the women of the neighborhood gave him a name, saying, “A son has been born to Naomi.” They named him Obed; he was the father of Jesse, the father of David.
RUT.4.18	Now these are the descendants of Perez: Perez was the father of Hezron, 
RUT.4.19	Hezron of Ram, Ram of Amminadab, 
RUT.4.20	Amminadab of Nahshon, Nahshon of Salmon, 
RUT.4.21	Salmon of Boaz, Boaz of Obed, 
RUT.4.22	Obed of Jesse, and Jesse of David.
1SA.1.1	There was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. 
1SA.1.2	He had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
1SA.1.3	Now this man used to go up year by year from his city to worship and to sacrifice to the 
1SA.1.4	On the day when Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters; 
1SA.1.5	and, although
1SA.1.6	And her rival used to provoke her sorely, to irritate her, because the 
1SA.1.7	So it went on year by year; as often as she went up to the house of the 
1SA.1.8	And Elkanah, her husband, said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? And why do you not eat? And why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?”
1SA.1.9	After they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh, Hannah rose. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of the temple of the 
1SA.1.10	She was deeply distressed and prayed to the 
1SA.1.11	And she vowed a vow and said, “O 
1SA.1.12	As she continued praying before the 
1SA.1.13	Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, and her voice was not heard; therefore Eli took her to be a drunken woman. 
1SA.1.14	And Eli said to her, “How long will you be drunken? Put away your wine from you.” 
1SA.1.15	But Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a woman sorely troubled; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the 
1SA.1.16	Do not regard your maidservant as a base woman, for all along I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation.” 
1SA.1.17	Then Eli answered, “Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition which you have made to him.” 
1SA.1.18	And she said, “Let your maidservant find favor in your eyes.” Then the woman went her way and ate, and her countenance was no longer sad.
1SA.1.19	They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the 
1SA.1.20	and in due time Hannah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Samuel, for she said, “I have asked him of the 
1SA.1.21	And the man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the 
1SA.1.22	But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, “As soon as the child is weaned, I will bring him, that he may appear in the presence of the 
1SA.1.23	Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems best to you, wait until you have weaned him; only, may the 
1SA.1.24	And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull,
1SA.1.25	Then they slew the bull, and they brought the child to Eli. 
1SA.1.26	And she said, “Oh, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who was standing here in your presence, praying to the 
1SA.1.27	For this child I prayed; and the 
1SA.1.28	Therefore I have lent him to the 
1SA.1.28	And they
1SA.2.1	“My heart exults in the 
1SA.2.1	my strength is exalted in the 
1SA.2.1	My mouth derides my enemies,
1SA.2.1	because I rejoice in thy salvation.
1SA.2.2	“There is none holy like the 
1SA.2.2	there is none besides thee;
1SA.2.2	there is no rock like our God.
1SA.2.3	Talk no more so very proudly,
1SA.2.3	let not arrogance come from your mouth;
1SA.2.3	for the 
1SA.2.3	and by him actions are weighed.
1SA.2.4	The bows of the mighty are broken,
1SA.2.4	but the feeble gird on strength.
1SA.2.5	Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread,
1SA.2.5	but those who were hungry have ceased to hunger.
1SA.2.5	The barren has borne seven,
1SA.2.5	but she who has many children is forlorn.
1SA.2.6	The 
1SA.2.6	he brings down to Sheol and raises up.
1SA.2.7	The 
1SA.2.7	he brings low, he also exalts.
1SA.2.8	He raises up the poor from the dust;
1SA.2.8	he lifts the needy from the ash heap,
1SA.2.8	to make them sit with princes
1SA.2.8	and inherit a seat of honor.
1SA.2.8	For the pillars of the earth are the 
1SA.2.8	and on them he has set the world.
1SA.2.9	“He will guard the feet of his faithful ones;
1SA.2.9	but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness;
1SA.2.9	for not by might shall a man prevail.
1SA.2.10	The adversaries of the 
1SA.2.10	against them he will thunder in heaven.
1SA.2.10	The 
1SA.2.10	he will give strength to his king,
1SA.2.10	and exalt the power of his anointed.”
1SA.2.11	Then Elkanah went home to Ramah. And the boy ministered to the 
1SA.2.12	Now the sons of Eli were worthless men; they had no regard for the 
1SA.2.13	The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand, 
1SA.2.14	and he would thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself.
1SA.2.15	Moreover, before the fat was burned, the priest's servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, “Give meat for the priest to roast; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but raw.” 
1SA.2.16	And if the man said to him, “Let them burn the fat first, and then take as much as you wish,” he would say, “No, you must give it now; and if not, I will take it by force.” 
1SA.2.17	Thus the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of the 
1SA.2.18	Samuel was ministering before the 
1SA.2.19	And his mother used to make for him a little robe and take it to him each year, when she went up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. 
1SA.2.20	Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say, “The 
1SA.2.21	And the 
1SA.2.22	Now Eli was very old, and he heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting. 
1SA.2.23	And he said to them, “Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all the people. 
1SA.2.24	No, my sons; it is no good report that I hear the people of the 
1SA.2.25	If a man sins against a man, God will mediate for him; but if a man sins against the 
1SA.2.27	And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, “Thus the 
1SA.2.28	And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me; and I gave to the house of your father all my offerings by fire from the people of Israel. 
1SA.2.29	Why then look with greedy eye at
1SA.2.30	Therefore the 
1SA.2.31	Behold, the days are coming, when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father's house, so that there will not be an old man in your house. 
1SA.2.32	Then in distress you will look with envious eye on all the prosperity which shall be bestowed upon Israel; and there shall not be an old man in your house for ever. 
1SA.2.33	The man of you whom I shall not cut off from my altar shall be spared to weep out his
1SA.2.34	And this which shall befall your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, shall be the sign to you: both of them shall die on the same day. 
1SA.2.35	And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who shall do according to what is in my heart and in my mind; and I will build him a sure house, and he shall go in and out before my anointed for ever. 
1SA.2.36	And every one who is left in your house shall come to implore him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread, and shall say, “Put me, I pray you, in one of the priest's places, that I may eat a morsel of bread.” ’ ”
1SA.3.1	Now the boy Samuel was ministering to the 
1SA.3.2	At that time Eli, whose eyesight had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see, was lying down in his own place; 
1SA.3.3	the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down within the temple of the 
1SA.3.4	Then the 
1SA.3.5	and ran to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call; lie down again.” So he went and lay down. 
1SA.3.6	And the 
1SA.3.7	Now Samuel did not yet know the 
1SA.3.8	And the 
1SA.3.9	Therefore Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down; and if he calls you, you shall say, ‘Speak, 
1SA.3.10	And the 
1SA.3.11	Then the 
1SA.3.12	On that day I will fulfil against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end. 
1SA.3.13	And I tell him that I am about to punish his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons were blaspheming God,
1SA.3.14	Therefore I swear to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be expiated by sacrifice or offering for ever.”
1SA.3.15	Samuel lay until morning; then he opened the doors of the house of the 
1SA.3.16	But Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son.” And he said, “Here I am.” 
1SA.3.17	And Eli said, “What was it that he told you? Do not hide it from me. May God do so to you and more also, if you hide anything from me of all that he told you.” 
1SA.3.18	So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. And he said, “It is the 
1SA.3.19	And Samuel grew, and the 
1SA.3.20	And all Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established as a prophet of the 
1SA.3.21	And the 
1SA.4.1	And the word of Samuel came to all Israel.
1SA.4.1	Now Israel went out to battle against the Philistines; they encamped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines encamped at Aphek. 
1SA.4.2	The Philistines drew up in line against Israel, and when the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who slew about four thousand men on the field of battle. 
1SA.4.3	And when the troops came to the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has the 
1SA.4.4	So the people sent to Shiloh, and brought from there the ark of the covenant of the 
1SA.4.5	When the ark of the covenant of the 
1SA.4.6	And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, “What does this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews mean?” And when they learned that the ark of the 
1SA.4.7	the Philistines were afraid; for they said, “A god has come into the camp.” And they said, “Woe to us! For nothing like this has happened before. 
1SA.4.8	Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the power of these mighty gods? These are the gods who smote the Egyptians with every sort of plague in the wilderness. 
1SA.4.9	Take courage, and acquit yourselves like men, O Philistines, lest you become slaves to the Hebrews as they have been to you; acquit yourselves like men and fight.”
1SA.4.10	So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and they fled, every man to his home; and there was a very great slaughter, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers. 
1SA.4.11	And the ark of God was captured; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
1SA.4.12	A man of Benjamin ran from the battle line, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes rent and with earth upon his head. 
1SA.4.13	When he arrived, Eli was sitting upon his seat by the road watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city and told the news, all the city cried out. 
1SA.4.14	When Eli heard the sound of the outcry, he said, “What is this uproar?” Then the man hastened and came and told Eli. 
1SA.4.15	Now Eli was ninety-eight years old and his eyes were set, so that he could not see. 
1SA.4.16	And the man said to Eli, “I am he who has come from the battle; I fled from the battle today.” And he said, “How did it go, my son?” 
1SA.4.17	He who brought the tidings answered and said, “Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has also been a great slaughter among the people; your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.” 
1SA.4.18	When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell over backward from his seat by the side of the gate; and his neck was broken and he died, for he was an old man, and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.
1SA.4.19	Now his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was with child, about to give birth. And when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was captured, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed and gave birth; for her pains came upon her. 
1SA.4.20	And about the time of her death the women attending her said to her, “Fear not, for you have borne a son.” But she did not answer or give heed. 
1SA.4.21	And she named the child Ichabod, saying, “The glory has departed from Israel!” because the ark of God had been captured and because of her father-in-law and her husband. 
1SA.4.22	And she said, “The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured.”
1SA.5.1	When the Philistines captured the ark of God, they carried it from Ebenezer to Ashdod; 
1SA.5.2	then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it into the house of Dagon and set it up beside Dagon. 
1SA.5.3	And when the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, behold, Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground before the ark of the 
1SA.5.4	But when they rose early on the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground before the ark of the 
1SA.5.5	This is why the priests of Dagon and all who enter the house of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.
1SA.5.6	The hand of the 
1SA.5.7	And when the men of Ashdod saw how things were, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us; for his hand is heavy upon us and upon Dagon our god.” 
1SA.5.8	So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” They answered, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath.” So they brought the ark of the God of Israel there. 
1SA.5.9	But after they had brought it around, the hand of the 
1SA.5.10	So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But when the ark of God came to Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, “They have brought around to us the ark of the God of Israel to slay us and our people.” 
1SA.5.11	They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it return to its own place, that it may not slay us and our people.” For there was a deathly panic throughout the whole city. The hand of God was very heavy there; 
1SA.5.12	the men who did not die were stricken with tumors, and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
1SA.6.1	The ark of the 
1SA.6.2	And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the 
1SA.6.3	They said, “If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty, but by all means return him a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why his hand does not turn away from you.” 
1SA.6.4	And they said, “What is the guilt offering that we shall return to him?” They answered, “Five golden tumors and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines; for the same plague was upon all of you and upon your lords. 
1SA.6.5	So you must make images of your tumors and images of your mice that ravage the land, and give glory to the God of Israel; perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you and your gods and your land. 
1SA.6.6	Why should you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? After he had made sport of them, did not they let the people go, and they departed? 
1SA.6.7	Now then, take and prepare a new cart and two milch cows upon which there has never come a yoke, and yoke the cows to the cart, but take their calves home, away from them. 
1SA.6.8	And take the ark of the 
1SA.6.9	And watch; if it goes up on the way to its own land, to Beth-shemesh, then it is he who has done us this great harm; but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that struck us, it happened to us by chance.”
1SA.6.10	The men did so, and took two milch cows and yoked them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home. 
1SA.6.11	And they put the ark of the 
1SA.6.12	And the cows went straight in the direction of Beth-shemesh along one highway, lowing as they went; they turned neither to the right nor to the left, and the lords of the Philistines went after them as far as the border of Beth-shemesh. 
1SA.6.13	Now the people of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and when they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, they rejoiced to see it. 
1SA.6.14	The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh, and stopped there. A great stone was there; and they split up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the 
1SA.6.15	And the Levites took down the ark of the 
1SA.6.16	And when the five lords of the Philistines saw it, they returned that day to Ekron.
1SA.6.17	These are the golden tumors, which the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to the 
1SA.6.18	also the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both fortified cities and unwalled villages. The great stone, beside which they set down the ark of the 
1SA.6.19	And he slew some of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they looked into the ark of the 
1SA.6.20	Then the men of Beth-shemesh said, “Who is able to stand before the 
1SA.6.21	So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, “The Philistines have returned the ark of the 
1SA.7.1	And the men of Kiriath-jearim came and took up the ark of the 
1SA.7.2	From the day that the ark was lodged at Kiriath-jearim, a long time passed, some twenty years, and all the house of Israel lamented after the 
1SA.7.3	Then Samuel said to all the house of Israel, “If you are returning to the 
1SA.7.4	So Israel put away the Baals and the Ashtaroth, and they served the 
1SA.7.5	Then Samuel said, “Gather all Israel at Mizpah, and I will pray to the 
1SA.7.6	So they gathered at Mizpah, and drew water and poured it out before the 
1SA.7.7	Now when the Philistines heard that the people of Israel had gathered at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the people of Israel heard of it they were afraid of the Philistines. 
1SA.7.8	And the people of Israel said to Samuel, “Do not cease to cry to the 
1SA.7.9	So Samuel took a sucking lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the 
1SA.7.10	As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to attack Israel; but the 
1SA.7.11	And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, as far as below Beth-car.
1SA.7.12	Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Jeshanah,
1SA.7.13	So the Philistines were subdued and did not again enter the territory of Israel. And the hand of the 
1SA.7.14	The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath; and Israel rescued their territory from the hand of the Philistines. There was peace also between Israel and the Amorites.
1SA.7.15	Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 
1SA.7.16	And he went on a circuit year by year to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all these places. 
1SA.7.17	Then he would come back to Ramah, for his home was there, and there also he administered justice to Israel. And he built there an altar to the 
1SA.8.1	When Samuel became old, he made his sons judges over Israel. 
1SA.8.2	The name of his first-born son was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judges in Beer-sheba. 
1SA.8.3	Yet his sons did not walk in his ways, but turned aside after gain; they took bribes and perverted justice.
1SA.8.4	Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah, 
1SA.8.5	and said to him, “Behold, you are old and your sons do not walk in your ways; now appoint for us a king to govern us like all the nations.” 
1SA.8.6	But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, “Give us a king to govern us.” And Samuel prayed to the 
1SA.8.7	And the 
1SA.8.8	According to all the deeds which they have done to me,
1SA.8.9	Now then, hearken to their voice; only, you shall solemnly warn them, and show them the ways of the king who shall reign over them.”
1SA.8.10	So Samuel told all the words of the 
1SA.8.11	He said, “These will be the ways of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and to be his horsemen, and to run before his chariots; 
1SA.8.12	and he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest, and to make his implements of war and the equipment of his chariots. 
1SA.8.13	He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers. 
1SA.8.14	He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive orchards and give them to his servants. 
1SA.8.15	He will take the tenth of your grain and of your vineyards and give it to his officers and to his servants. 
1SA.8.16	He will take your menservants and maidservants, and the best of your cattle
1SA.8.17	He will take the tenth of your flocks, and you shall be his slaves. 
1SA.8.18	And in that day you will cry out because of your king, whom you have chosen for yourselves; but the 
1SA.8.19	But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel; and they said, “No! but we will have a king over us, 
1SA.8.20	that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may govern us and go out before us and fight our battles.” 
1SA.8.21	And when Samuel had heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the ears of the 
1SA.8.22	And the 
1SA.9.1	There was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Becorath, son of Aphiah, a Benjaminite, a man of wealth; 
1SA.9.2	and he had a son whose name was Saul, a handsome young man. There was not a man among the people of Israel more handsome than he; from his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people.
1SA.9.3	Now the asses of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. So Kish said to Saul his son, “Take one of the servants with you, and arise, go and look for the asses.” 
1SA.9.4	And they
1SA.9.5	When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, let us go back, lest my father cease to care about the asses and become anxious about us.” 
1SA.9.6	But he said to him, “Behold, there is a man of God in this city, and he is a man that is held in honor; all that he says comes true. Let us go there; perhaps he can tell us about the journey on which we have set out.” 
1SA.9.7	Then Saul said to his servant, “But if we go, what can we bring the man? For the bread in our sacks is gone, and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What have we?” 
1SA.9.8	The servant answered Saul again, “Here, I have with me the fourth part of a shekel of silver, and I will give it to the man of God, to tell us our way.” 
1SA.9.9	(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he said, “Come, let us go to the seer”; for he who is now called a prophet was formerly called a seer.) 
1SA.9.10	And Saul said to his servant, “Well said; come, let us go.” So they went to the city where the man of God was.
1SA.9.11	As they went up the hill to the city, they met young maidens coming out to draw water, and said to them, “Is the seer here?” 
1SA.9.12	They answered, “He is; behold, he is just ahead of you. Make haste; he has come just now to the city, because the people have a sacrifice today on the high place. 
1SA.9.13	As soon as you enter the city, you will find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat till he comes, since he must bless the sacrifice; afterward those eat who are invited. Now go up, for you will meet him immediately.” 
1SA.9.14	So they went up to the city. As they were entering the city, they saw Samuel coming out toward them on his way up to the high place.
1SA.9.15	Now the day before Saul came, the 
1SA.9.16	“Tomorrow about this time I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel. He shall save my people from the hand of Philistines; for I have seen the affliction of
1SA.9.17	When Samuel saw Saul, the 
1SA.9.18	Then Saul approached Samuel in the gate, and said, “Tell me where is the house of the seer?” 
1SA.9.19	Samuel answered Saul, “I am the seer; go up before me to the high place, for today you shall eat with me, and in the morning I will let you go and will tell you all that is on your mind. 
1SA.9.20	As for your asses that were lost three days ago, do not set your mind on them, for they have been found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you and for all your father's house?” 
1SA.9.21	Saul answered, “Am I not a Benjaminite, from the least of the tribes of Israel? And is not my family the humblest of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then have you spoken to me in this way?”
1SA.9.22	Then Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall and gave them a place at the head of those who had been invited, who were about thirty persons. 
1SA.9.23	And Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the portion I gave you, of which I said to you, ‘Put it aside.’ ” 
1SA.9.24	So the cook took up the leg and the upper portion
1SA.9.24	So Saul ate with Samuel that day. 
1SA.9.25	And when they came down from the high place into the city, a bed was spread for Saul
1SA.9.26	Then at the break of dawn
1SA.9.27	As they were going down to the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to pass on before us, and when he has passed on stop here yourself for a while, that I may make known to you the word of God.”
1SA.10.1	Then Samuel took a vial of oil and poured it on his head, and kissed him and said, “Has not the 
1SA.10.2	When you depart from me today you will meet two men by Rachel's tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah, and they will say to you, ‘The asses which you went to seek are found, and now your father has ceased to care about the asses and is anxious about you, saying, “What shall I do about my son?” ’ 
1SA.10.3	Then you shall go on from there further and come to the oak of Tabor; three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there, one carrying three kids, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine. 
1SA.10.4	And they will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall accept from their hand. 
1SA.10.5	After that you shall come to Gibeath-elohim,
1SA.10.6	Then the spirit of the 
1SA.10.7	Now when these signs meet you, do whatever your hand finds to do, for God is with you. 
1SA.10.8	And you shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I am coming to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice peace offerings. Seven days you shall wait, until I come to you and show you what you shall do.”
1SA.10.9	When he turned his back to leave Samuel, God gave him another heart; and all these signs came to pass that day. 
1SA.10.10	When they came to Gibe-ah,
1SA.10.11	 And when all who knew him before saw how he prophesied with the prophets, the people said to one another, “What has come over the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?” 
1SA.10.12	And a man of the place answered, “And who is their father?” Therefore it became a proverb, “Is Saul also among the prophets?” 
1SA.10.13	When he had finished prophesying, he came to the high place.
1SA.10.14	Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, “Where did you go?” And he said, “To seek the asses; and when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.” 
1SA.10.15	And Saul's uncle said, “Pray, tell me what Samuel said to you.” 
1SA.10.16	And Saul said to his uncle, “He told us plainly that the asses had been found.” But about the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel had spoken, he did not tell him anything.
1SA.10.17	Now Samuel called the people together to the 
1SA.10.18	and he said to the people of Israel, “Thus says the 
1SA.10.19	But you have this day rejected your God, who saves you from all your calamities and your distresses; and you have said, ‘No! but set a king over us.’ Now therefore present yourselves before the 
1SA.10.20	Then Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot. 
1SA.10.21	He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by its families, and the family of the Matrites was taken by lot; finally he brought the family of the Matrites near man by man,
1SA.10.22	So they inquired again of the 
1SA.10.23	Then they ran and fetched him from there; and when he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward. 
1SA.10.24	And Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see him whom the 
1SA.10.25	Then Samuel told the people the rights and duties of the kingship; and he wrote them in a book and laid it up before the 
1SA.10.26	Saul also went to his home at Gibe-ah, and with him went men of valor whose hearts God had touched. 
1SA.10.27	But some worthless fellows said, “How can this man save us?” And they despised him, and brought him no present. But he held his peace.
1SA.11.1	Then Nahash the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh-gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a treaty with us, and we will serve you.” 
1SA.11.2	But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, “On this condition I will make a treaty with you, that I gouge out all your right eyes, and thus put disgrace upon all Israel.” 
1SA.11.3	The elders of Jabesh said to him, “Give us seven days respite that we may send messengers through all the territory of Israel. Then, if there is no one to save us, we will give ourselves up to you.” 
1SA.11.4	When the messengers came to Gibe-ah of Saul, they reported the matter in the ears of the people; and all the people wept aloud.
1SA.11.5	Now Saul was coming from the field behind the oxen; and Saul said, “What ails the people, that they are weeping?” So they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh. 
1SA.11.6	And the spirit of God came mightily upon Saul when he heard these words, and his anger was greatly kindled. 
1SA.11.7	He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, “Whoever does not come out after Saul and Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen!” Then the dread of the 
1SA.11.8	When he mustered them at Bezek, the men of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand. 
1SA.11.9	And they said to the messengers who had come, “Thus shall you say to the men of Jabesh-gilead: ‘Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have deliverance.’ ” When the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh, they were glad. 
1SA.11.10	Therefore the men of Jabesh said, “Tomorrow we will give ourselves up to you, and you may do to us whatever seems good to you.” 
1SA.11.11	And on the morrow Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and cut down the Ammonites until the heat of the day; and those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.
1SA.11.12	Then the people said to Samuel, “Who is it that said, ‘Shall Saul reign over us?’ Bring the men, that we may put them to death.” 
1SA.11.13	But Saul said, “Not a man shall be put to death this day, for today the 
1SA.11.14	Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go to Gilgal and there renew the kingdom.” 
1SA.11.15	So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the 
1SA.12.1	And Samuel said to all Israel, “Behold, I have hearkened to your voice in all that you have said to me, and have made a king over you. 
1SA.12.2	And now, behold, the king walks before you; and I am old and gray, and behold, my sons are with you; and I have walked before you from my youth until this day. 
1SA.12.3	Here I am; testify against me before the 
1SA.12.4	They said, “You have not defrauded us or oppressed us or taken anything from any man's hand.” 
1SA.12.5	And he said to them, “The 
1SA.12.6	And Samuel said to the people, “The 
1SA.12.7	Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before the 
1SA.12.8	When Jacob went into Egypt and the Egyptians oppressed them,
1SA.12.9	But they forgot the 
1SA.12.10	And they cried to the 
1SA.12.11	And the 
1SA.12.12	And when you saw that Nahash the king of the Ammonites came against you, you said to me, ‘No, but a king shall reign over us,’ when the 
1SA.12.13	And now behold the king whom you have chosen, for whom you have asked; behold, the 
1SA.12.14	If you will fear the 
1SA.12.15	but if you will not hearken to the voice of the 
1SA.12.16	Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which the 
1SA.12.17	Is it not wheat harvest today? I will call upon the 
1SA.12.18	So Samuel called upon the 
1SA.12.19	And all the people said to Samuel, “Pray for your servants to the 
1SA.12.20	And Samuel said to the people, “Fear not; you have done all this evil, yet do not turn aside from following the 
1SA.12.21	and do not turn aside after
1SA.12.22	For the 
1SA.12.23	Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the 
1SA.12.24	Only fear the 
1SA.12.25	But if you still do wickedly, you shall be swept away, both you and your king.”
1SA.13.1	Saul was …
1SA.13.2	Saul chose three thousand men of Israel; two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibe-ah of Benjamin; the rest of the people he sent home, every man to his tent. 
1SA.13.3	Jonathan defeated the garrison of the Philistines which was at Geba; and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear.” 
1SA.13.4	And all Israel heard it said that Saul had defeated the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel had become odious to the Philistines. And the people were called out to join Saul at Gilgal.
1SA.13.5	And the Philistines mustered to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and troops like the sand on the seashore in multitude; they came up and encamped in Michmash, to the east of Beth-aven. 
1SA.13.6	When the men of Israel saw that they were in straits (for the people were hard pressed), the people hid themselves in caves and in holes and in rocks and in tombs and in cisterns, 
1SA.13.7	or crossed the fords of the Jordan
1SA.13.8	He waited seven days, the time appointed by Samuel; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people were scattering from him. 
1SA.13.9	So Saul said, “Bring the burnt offering here to me, and the peace offerings.” And he offered the burnt offering. 
1SA.13.10	As soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him and salute him. 
1SA.13.11	Samuel said, “What have you done?” And Saul said, “When I saw that the people were scattering from me, and that you did not come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines had mustered at Michmash, 
1SA.13.12	I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down upon me at Gilgal, and I have not entreated the favor of the 
1SA.13.13	And Samuel said to Saul, “You have done foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of the 
1SA.13.14	 But now your kingdom shall not continue; the 
1SA.13.15	And Samuel arose, and went up from Gilgal to Gibe-ah of Benjamin.
1SA.13.15	And Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men. 
1SA.13.16	And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people who were present with them, stayed in Geba of Benjamin; but the Philistines encamped in Michmash. 
1SA.13.17	And raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies; one company turned toward Ophrah, to the land of Shual, 
1SA.13.18	another company turned toward Beth-horon, and another company turned toward the border that looks down upon the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
1SA.13.19	Now there was no smith to be found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, “Lest the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears”; 
1SA.13.20	but every one of the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen his plowshare, his mattock, his axe, or his sickle;
1SA.13.21	and the charge was a pim for the plowshares and for the mattocks, and a third of a shekel for sharpening the axes and for setting the goads.
1SA.13.22	So on the day of the battle there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan; but Saul and Jonathan his son had them. 
1SA.13.23	And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.
1SA.14.1	One day Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come, let us go over to the Philistine garrison on yonder side.” But he did not tell his father. 
1SA.14.2	Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gibe-ah under the pomegranate tree which is at Migron; the people who were with him were about six hundred men, 
1SA.14.3	and Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, son of Phinehas, son of Eli, the priest of the 
1SA.14.4	In the pass,
1SA.14.5	The one crag rose on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.
1SA.14.6	And Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised; it may be that the 
1SA.14.7	And his armor-bearer said to him, “Do all that your mind inclines to;
1SA.14.8	Then said Jonathan, “Behold, we will cross over to the men, and we will show ourselves to them. 
1SA.14.9	If they say to us, ‘Wait until we come to you,’ then we will stand still in our place, and we will not go up to them. 
1SA.14.10	But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up; for the 
1SA.14.11	So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines; and the Philistines said, “Look, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hid themselves.” 
1SA.14.12	And the men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor-bearer, and said, “Come up to us, and we will show you a thing.” And Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, “Come up after me; for the 
1SA.14.13	Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer after him. And they fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer killed them after him; 
1SA.14.14	and that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made, was of about twenty men within as it were half a furrow's length in an acre
1SA.14.15	And there was a panic in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison and even the raiders trembled; the earth quaked; and it became a very great panic.
1SA.14.16	And the watchmen of Saul in Gibe-ah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude was surging hither and thither.
1SA.14.17	Then Saul said to the people who were with him, “Number and see who has gone from us.” And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there. 
1SA.14.18	And Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring hither the ark of God.” For the ark of God went at that time with the people of Israel. 
1SA.14.19	And while Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines increased more and more; and Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.” 
1SA.14.20	Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and went into the battle; and behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was very great confusion. 
1SA.14.21	Now the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines before that time and who had gone up with them into the camp, even they also turned to be with
1SA.14.22	Likewise, when all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they too followed hard after them in the battle. 
1SA.14.23	So the 
1SA.14.24	And the men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul laid an oath on the people, saying, “Cursed be the man who eats food until it is evening and I am avenged on my enemies.” So none of the people tasted food. 
1SA.14.25	And all the people
1SA.14.26	And when the people entered the forest, behold, the honey was dropping, but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath. 
1SA.14.27	But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath; so he put forth the tip of the staff that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes became bright. 
1SA.14.28	Then one of the people said, “Your father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, ‘Cursed be the man who eats food this day.’ ” And the people were faint. 
1SA.14.29	Then Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land; see how my eyes have become bright, because I tasted a little of this honey. 
1SA.14.30	How much better if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found; for now the slaughter among the Philistines has not been great.”
1SA.14.31	They struck down the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very faint; 
1SA.14.32	the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep and oxen and calves, and slew them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood. 
1SA.14.33	Then they told Saul, “Behold, the people are sinning against the 
1SA.14.34	And Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, ‘Let every man bring his ox or his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and do not sin against the 
1SA.14.35	And Saul built an altar to the 
1SA.14.36	Then Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night and despoil them until the morning light; let us not leave a man of them.” And they said, “Do whatever seems good to you.” But the priest said, “Let us draw near hither to God.” 
1SA.14.37	And Saul inquired of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Wilt thou give them into the hand of Israel?” But he did not answer him that day. 
1SA.14.38	And Saul said, “Come hither, all you leaders of the people; and know and see how this sin has arisen today. 
1SA.14.39	For as the 
1SA.14.40	Then he said to all Israel, “You shall be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.” And the people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.” 
1SA.14.41	Therefore Saul said, “O 
1SA.14.42	Then Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan.” And Jonathan was taken.
1SA.14.43	Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” And Jonathan told him, “I tasted a little honey with the tip of the staff that was in my hand; here I am, I will die.” 
1SA.14.44	And Saul said, “God do so to me and more also; you shall surely die, Jonathan.” 
1SA.14.45	Then the people said to Saul, “Shall Jonathan die, who has wrought this great victory in Israel? Far from it! As the 
1SA.14.46	Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.
1SA.14.47	When Saul had taken the kingship over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, against the Ammonites, against Edom, against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines; wherever he turned he put them to the worse. 
1SA.14.48	And he did valiantly, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.
1SA.14.50	and the name of Saul's wife was Ahino-am the daughter of Ahima-az. And the name of the commander of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul's uncle; 
1SA.14.51	Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
1SA.14.52	There was hard fighting against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he attached him to himself.
1SA.15.1	And Samuel said to Saul, “The 
1SA.15.2	Thus says the 
1SA.15.3	Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have; do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.’ ”
1SA.15.4	So Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand men on foot, and ten thousand men of Judah. 
1SA.15.5	And Saul came to the city of Amalek, and lay in wait in the valley. 
1SA.15.6	And Saul said to the Kenites, “Go, depart, go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the people of Israel when they came up out of Egypt.” So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. 
1SA.15.7	And Saul defeated the Amalekites, from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt. 
1SA.15.8	And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. 
1SA.15.9	But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them; all that was despised and worthless they utterly destroyed.
1SA.15.10	The word of the 
1SA.15.11	“I repent that I have made Saul king; for he has turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments.” And Samuel was angry; and he cried to the 
1SA.15.12	And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, “Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal.” 
1SA.15.13	And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, “Blessed be you to the 
1SA.15.14	And Samuel said, “What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?” 
1SA.15.15	Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice to the 
1SA.15.16	Then Samuel said to Saul, “Stop! I will tell you what the 
1SA.15.17	And Samuel said, “Though you are little in your own eyes, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? The 
1SA.15.18	And the 
1SA.15.19	Why then did you not obey the voice of the 
1SA.15.20	And Saul said to Samuel, “I have obeyed the voice of the 
1SA.15.21	But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the best of the things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to the 
1SA.15.22	 And Samuel said,
1SA.15.22	“Has the 
1SA.15.22	as in obeying the voice of the 
1SA.15.22	Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice,
1SA.15.22	and to hearken than the fat of rams.
1SA.15.23	For rebellion is as the sin of divination,
1SA.15.23	and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.
1SA.15.23	Because you have rejected the word of the 
1SA.15.23	he has also rejected you from being king.”
1SA.15.24	And Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of the 
1SA.15.25	Now therefore, I pray, pardon my sin, and return with me, that I may worship the 
1SA.15.26	And Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of the 
1SA.15.27	As Samuel turned to go away, Saul laid hold upon the skirt of his robe, and it tore. 
1SA.15.28	And Samuel said to him, “The 
1SA.15.29	And also the Glory of Israel will not lie or repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent.” 
1SA.15.30	Then he said, “I have sinned; yet honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me, that I may worship the 
1SA.15.31	So Samuel turned back after Saul; and Saul worshiped the 
1SA.15.32	Then Samuel said, “Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites.” And Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.” 
1SA.15.33	And Samuel said, “As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.” And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the 
1SA.15.34	Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house in Gibe-ah of Saul. 
1SA.15.35	And Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, but Samuel grieved over Saul. And the 
1SA.16.1	The 
1SA.16.2	And Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.” And the 
1SA.16.3	And invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do; and you shall anoint for me him whom I name to you.” 
1SA.16.4	Samuel did what the 
1SA.16.5	And he said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the 
1SA.16.6	When they came, he looked on Eliab and thought, “Surely the 
1SA.16.7	But the 
1SA.16.8	Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, “Neither has the 
1SA.16.9	Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, “Neither has the 
1SA.16.10	And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, “The 
1SA.16.11	And Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all your sons here?” And he said, “There remains yet the youngest, but behold, he is keeping the sheep.” And Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he comes here.” 
1SA.16.12	And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and had beautiful eyes, and was handsome. And the 
1SA.16.13	Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the 
1SA.16.14	Now the Spirit of the 
1SA.16.15	And Saul's servants said to him, “Behold now, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you. 
1SA.16.16	Let our lord now command your servants, who are before you, to seek out a man who is skilful in playing the lyre; and when the evil spirit from God is upon you, he will play it, and you will be well.” 
1SA.16.17	So Saul said to his servants, “Provide for me a man who can play well, and bring him to me.” 
1SA.16.18	One of the young men answered, “Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skilful in playing, a man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a man of good presence; and the 
1SA.16.19	Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, “Send me David your son, who is with the sheep.” 
1SA.16.20	And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a skin of wine and a kid, and sent them by David his son to Saul. 
1SA.16.21	And David came to Saul, and entered his service. And Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armor-bearer. 
1SA.16.22	And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, “Let David remain in my service, for he has found favor in my sight.” 
1SA.16.23	And whenever the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, David took the lyre and played it with his hand; so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
1SA.17.1	Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle; and they were gathered at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim. 
1SA.17.2	And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered, and encamped in the valley of Elah, and drew up in line of battle against the Philistines. 
1SA.17.3	And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side, with a valley between them. 
1SA.17.4	And there came out from the camp of the Philistines a champion named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span. 
1SA.17.5	He had a helmet of bronze on his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail, and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bronze. 
1SA.17.6	And he had greaves of bronze upon his legs, and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders. 
1SA.17.7	And the shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron; and his shield-bearer went before him. 
1SA.17.8	He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, “Why have you come out to draw up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me. 
1SA.17.9	If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us.” 
1SA.17.10	And the Philistine said, “I defy the ranks of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.” 
1SA.17.11	When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.
1SA.17.12	Now David was the son of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, named Jesse, who had eight sons. In the days of Saul the man was already old and advanced in years.
1SA.17.13	The three eldest sons of Jesse had followed Saul to the battle; and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the first-born, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah. 
1SA.17.14	David was the youngest; the three eldest followed Saul, 
1SA.17.15	but David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem. 
1SA.17.16	For forty days the Philistine came forward and took his stand, morning and evening.
1SA.17.17	And Jesse said to David his son, “Take for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers; 
1SA.17.18	also take these ten cheeses to the commander of their thousand. See how your brothers fare, and bring some token from them.”
1SA.17.19	Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines. 
1SA.17.20	And David rose early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took the provisions, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the encampment as the host was going forth to the battle line, shouting the war cry. 
1SA.17.21	And Israel and the Philistines drew up for battle, army against army. 
1SA.17.22	And David left the things in charge of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the ranks, and went and greeted his brothers. 
1SA.17.23	As he talked with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spoke the same words as before. And David heard him.
1SA.17.24	All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were much afraid. 
1SA.17.25	And the men of Israel said, “Have you seen this man who has come up? Surely he has come up to defy Israel; and the man who kills him, the king will enrich with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.” 
1SA.17.26	And David said to the men who stood by him, “What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?” 
1SA.17.27	And the people answered him in the same way, “So shall it be done to the man who kills him.”
1SA.17.28	Now Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, “Why have you come down? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your presumption, and the evil of your heart; for you have come down to see the battle.” 
1SA.17.29	And David said, “What have I done now? Was it not but a word?” 
1SA.17.30	And he turned away from him toward another, and spoke in the same way; and the people answered him again as before.
1SA.17.31	When the words which David spoke were heard, they repeated them before Saul; and he sent for him. 
1SA.17.32	And David said to Saul, “Let no man's heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.” 
1SA.17.33	And Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are but a youth, and he has been a man of war from his youth.” 
1SA.17.34	But David said to Saul, “Your servant used to keep sheep for his father; and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb from the flock, 
1SA.17.35	I went after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth; and if he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him and killed him. 
1SA.17.36	Your servant has killed both lions and bears; and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.” 
1SA.17.37	And David said, “The 
1SA.17.38	Then Saul clothed David with his armor; he put a helmet of bronze on his head, and clothed him with a coat of mail. 
1SA.17.39	And David girded his sword over his armor, and he tried in vain to go, for he was not used to them. Then David said to Saul, “I cannot go with these; for I am not used to them.” And David put them off. 
1SA.17.40	Then he took his staff in his hand, and chose five smooth stones from the brook, and put them in his shepherd's bag or wallet; his sling was in his hand, and he drew near to the Philistine.
1SA.17.41	And the Philistine came on and drew near to David, with his shield-bearer in front of him. 
1SA.17.42	And when the Philistine looked, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, ruddy and comely in appearance. 
1SA.17.43	And the Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. 
1SA.17.44	The Philistine said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and to the beasts of the field.” 
1SA.17.45	Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin; but I come to you in the name of the 
1SA.17.46	This day the 
1SA.17.47	and that all this assembly may know that the 
1SA.17.48	When the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine. 
1SA.17.49	And David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone, and slung it, and struck the Philistine on his forehead; the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground.
1SA.17.50	So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine, and killed him; there was no sword in the hand of David. 
1SA.17.51	Then David ran and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath, and killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. 
1SA.17.52	And the men of Israel and Judah rose with a shout and pursued the Philistines as far as Gath
1SA.17.53	And the Israelites came back from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their camp. 
1SA.17.54	And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.
1SA.17.55	When Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is this youth?” And Abner said, “As your soul lives, O king, I cannot tell.” 
1SA.17.56	And the king said, “Inquire whose son the stripling is.” 
1SA.17.57	And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. 
1SA.17.58	And Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, young man?” And David answered, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.”
1SA.18.1	When he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. 
1SA.18.2	And Saul took him that day, and would not let him return to his father's house. 
1SA.18.3	Then Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his own soul. 
1SA.18.4	And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his armor, and even his sword and his bow and his girdle. 
1SA.18.5	And David went out and was successful wherever Saul sent him; so that Saul set him over the men of war. And this was good in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
1SA.18.6	As they were coming home, when David returned from slaying the Philistine, the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with timbrels, with songs of joy, and with instruments
1SA.18.7	 And the women sang to one another as they made merry,
1SA.18.7	“Saul has slain his thousands,
1SA.18.7	and David his ten thousands.”
1SA.18.8	And Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him; he said, “They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed thousands; and what more can he have but the kingdom?” 
1SA.18.9	And Saul eyed David from that day on.
1SA.18.10	And on the morrow an evil spirit from God rushed upon Saul, and he raved within his house, while David was playing the lyre, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand; 
1SA.18.11	and Saul cast the spear, for he thought, “I will pin David to the wall.” But David evaded him twice.
1SA.18.12	Saul was afraid of David, because the 
1SA.18.13	So Saul removed him from his presence, and made him a commander of a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people. 
1SA.18.14	And David had success in all his undertakings; for the 
1SA.18.15	And when Saul saw that he had great success, he stood in awe of him. 
1SA.18.16	But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in before them.
1SA.18.17	Then Saul said to David, “Here is my elder daughter Merab; I will give her to you for a wife; only be valiant for me and fight the 
1SA.18.18	And David said to Saul, “Who am I, and who are my kinsfolk, my father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?” 
1SA.18.19	But at the time when Merab, Saul's daughter, should have been given to David, she was given to Adriel the Meholathite for a wife.
1SA.18.20	Now Saul's daughter Michal loved David; and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him. 
1SA.18.21	Saul thought, “Let me give her to him, that she may be a snare for him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” Therefore Saul said to David a second time,
1SA.18.22	And Saul commanded his servants, “Speak to David in private and say, ‘Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you; now then become the king's son-in-law.’ ” 
1SA.18.23	And Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, “Does it seem to you a little thing to become the king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man and of no repute?” 
1SA.18.24	And the servants of Saul told him, “Thus and so did David speak.” 
1SA.18.25	Then Saul said, “Thus shall you say to David, ‘The king desires no marriage present except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, that he may be avenged of the king's enemies.’ ” Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. 
1SA.18.26	And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son-in-law. Before the time had expired, 
1SA.18.27	David arose and went, along with his men, and killed two hundred of the Philistines; and David brought their foreskins, which were given in full number to the king, that he might become the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him his daughter Michal for a wife. 
1SA.18.28	But when Saul saw and knew that the 
1SA.18.29	Saul was still more afraid of David. So Saul was David's enemy continually.
1SA.18.30	Then the princes of the Philistines came out to battle, and as often as they came out David had more success than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was highly esteemed.
1SA.19.1	And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants, that they should kill David. But Jonathan, Saul's son, delighted much in David. 
1SA.19.2	And Jonathan told David, “Saul my father seeks to kill you; therefore take heed to yourself in the morning, stay in a secret place and hide yourself; 
1SA.19.3	and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak to my father about you; and if I learn anything I will tell you.” 
1SA.19.4	And Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father, and said to him, “Let not the king sin against his servant David; because he has not sinned against you, and because his deeds have been of good service to you; 
1SA.19.5	for he took his life in his hand and he slew the Philistine, and the 
1SA.19.6	And Saul hearkened to the voice of Jonathan; Saul swore, “As the 
1SA.19.7	And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all these things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as before.
1SA.19.8	And there was war again; and David went out and fought with the Philistines, and made a great slaughter among them, so that they fled before him. 
1SA.19.9	Then an evil spirit from the 
1SA.19.10	And Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear; but he eluded Saul, so that he struck the spear into the wall. And David fled, and escaped.
1SA.19.11	That night Saul
1SA.19.12	So Michal let David down through the window; and he fled away and escaped. 
1SA.19.13	Michal took an image
1SA.19.14	And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, “He is sick.” 
1SA.19.15	Then Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him.” 
1SA.19.16	And when the messengers came in, behold, the image
1SA.19.17	Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me thus, and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?” And Michal answered Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go; why should I kill you?’ ”
1SA.19.18	Now David fled and escaped, and he came to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt at Naioth. 
1SA.19.19	And it was told Saul, “Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.” 
1SA.19.20	Then Saul sent messengers to take David; and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied. 
1SA.19.21	When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied. 
1SA.19.22	Then he himself went to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu; and he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?” And one said, “Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.” 
1SA.19.23	 And he went from
1SA.19.24	And he too stripped off his clothes, and he too prophesied before Samuel, and lay naked all that day and all that night. Hence it is said, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”
1SA.20.1	Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, “What have I done? What is my guilt? And what is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?” 
1SA.20.2	And he said to him, “Far from it! You shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small without disclosing it to me; and why should my father hide this from me? It is not so.” 
1SA.20.3	But David replied,
1SA.20.4	Then said Jonathan to David, “Whatever you say, I will do for you.” 
1SA.20.5	David said to Jonathan, “Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit at table with the king; but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field till the third day at evening. 
1SA.20.6	If your father misses me at all, then say, ‘David earnestly asked leave of me to run to Bethlehem his city; for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.’ 
1SA.20.7	If he says, ‘Good!’ it will be well with your servant; but if he is angry, then know that evil is determined by him. 
1SA.20.8	Therefore deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a sacred covenant
1SA.20.9	And Jonathan said, “Far be it from you! If I knew that it was determined by my father that evil should come upon you, would I not tell you?” 
1SA.20.10	Then said David to Jonathan, “Who will tell me if your father answers you roughly?” 
1SA.20.11	And Jonathan said to David, “Come, let us go out into the field.” So they both went out into the field.
1SA.20.12	And Jonathan said to David, “The 
1SA.20.13	But should it please my father to do you harm, the 
1SA.20.14	If I am still alive, show me the loyal love of the 
1SA.20.15	and do not cut off your loyalty from my house for ever. When the 
1SA.20.16	let not the name of Jonathan be cut off from the house of David.
1SA.20.17	And Jonathan made David swear again by his love for him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
1SA.20.18	Then Jonathan said to him, “Tomorrow is the new moon; and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty. 
1SA.20.19	And on the third day you will be greatly missed;
1SA.20.20	And I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I shot at a mark. 
1SA.20.21	And behold, I will send the lad, saying, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I say to the lad, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you, take them,’ then you are to come, for, as the 
1SA.20.22	But if I say to the youth, ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you,’ then go; for the 
1SA.20.23	And as for the matter of which you and I have spoken, behold, the 
1SA.20.24	So David hid himself in the field; and when the new moon came, the king sat down to eat food. 
1SA.20.25	The king sat upon his seat, as at other times, upon the seat by the wall; Jonathan sat opposite,
1SA.20.26	Yet Saul did not say anything that day; for he thought, “Something has befallen him; he is not clean, surely he is not clean.” 
1SA.20.27	But on the second day, the morrow after the new moon, David's place was empty. And Saul said to Jonathan his son, “Why has not the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?” 
1SA.20.28	Jonathan answered Saul, “David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem; 
1SA.20.29	he said, ‘Let me go; for our family holds a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to be there. So now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away, and see my brothers.’ For this reason he has not come to the king's table.”
1SA.20.30	Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverse, rebellious woman, do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother's nakedness? 
1SA.20.31	For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon the earth, neither you nor your kingdom shall be established. Therefore send and fetch him to me, for he shall surely die.” 
1SA.20.32	Then Jonathan answered Saul his father, “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?” 
1SA.20.33	But Saul cast his spear at him to smite him; so Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death. 
1SA.20.34	And Jonathan rose from the table in fierce anger and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David, because his father had disgraced him.
1SA.20.35	In the morning Jonathan went out into the field to the appointment with David, and with him a little lad. 
1SA.20.36	And he said to his lad, “Run and find the arrows which I shoot.” As the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. 
1SA.20.37	And when the lad came to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called after the lad and said, “Is not the arrow beyond you?” 
1SA.20.38	And Jonathan called after the lad, “Hurry, make haste, stay not.” So Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master. 
1SA.20.39	But the lad knew nothing; only Jonathan and David knew the matter. 
1SA.20.40	And Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad, and said to him, “Go and carry them to the city.” 
1SA.20.41	And as soon as the lad had gone, David rose from beside the stone heap
1SA.20.42	Then Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the 
1SA.21.2	And David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has charged me with a matter, and said to me, ‘Let no one know anything of the matter about which I send you, and with which I have charged you.’ I have made an appointment with the young men for such and such a place. 
1SA.21.3	Now then, what have you at hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever is here.” 
1SA.21.4	And the priest answered David, “I have no common bread at hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.” 
1SA.21.5	And David answered the priest, “Of a truth women have been kept from us as always when I go on an expedition; the vessels of the young men are holy, even when it is a common journey; how much more today will their vessels be holy?” 
1SA.21.6	So the priest gave him the holy bread; for there was no bread there but the bread of the Presence, which is removed from before the 
1SA.21.7	Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the 
1SA.21.8	And David said to Ahimelech, “And have you not here a spear or a sword at hand? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.” 
1SA.21.9	And the priest said, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod; if you will take that, take it, for there is none but that here.” And David said, “There is none like that; give it to me.”
1SA.21.10	And David rose and fled that day from Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. 
1SA.21.11	 And the servants of Achish said to him, “Is not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing to one another of him in dances,
1SA.21.11	‘Saul has slain his thousands,
1SA.21.11	and David his ten thousands’?”
1SA.21.12	And David took these words to heart, and was much afraid of Achish the king of Gath. 
1SA.21.13	So he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and made marks on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle run down his beard. 
1SA.21.14	Then said Achish to his servants, “Lo, you see the man is mad; why then have you brought him to me? 
1SA.21.15	Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?”
1SA.22.1	David departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam; and when his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down there to him. 
1SA.22.2	And every one who was in distress, and every one who was in debt, and every one who was discontented, gathered to him; and he became captain over them. And there were with him about four hundred men.
1SA.22.3	And David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab; and he said to the king of Moab, “Pray let my father and my mother stay
1SA.22.4	And he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him all the time that David was in the stronghold. 
1SA.22.5	Then the prophet Gad said to David, “Do not remain in the stronghold; depart, and go into the land of Judah.” So David departed, and went into the forest of Hereth.
1SA.22.6	Now Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men who were with him. Saul was sitting at Gibe-ah, under the tamarisk tree on the height, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him. 
1SA.22.7	And Saul said to his servants who stood about him, “Hear now, you Benjaminites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, 
1SA.22.8	that all of you have conspired against me? No one discloses to me when my son makes a league with the son of Jesse, none of you is sorry for me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day.” 
1SA.22.9	Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, “I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, 
1SA.22.10	and he inquired of the 
1SA.22.11	Then the king sent to summon Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests who were at Nob; and all of them came to the king. 
1SA.22.12	And Saul said, “Hear now, son of Ahitub.” And he answered, “Here I am, my lord.” 
1SA.22.13	And Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, so that he has risen against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?” 
1SA.22.14	Then Ahimelech answered the king, “And who among all your servants is so faithful as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and captain over
1SA.22.15	Is today the first time that I have inquired of God for him? No! Let not the king impute anything to his servant or to all the house of my father; for your servant has known nothing of all this, much or little.” 
1SA.22.16	And the king said, “You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father's house.” 
1SA.22.17	And the king said to the guard who stood about him, “Turn and kill the priests of the 
1SA.22.18	Then the king said to Doeg, “You turn and fall upon the priests.” And Doeg the Edomite turned and fell upon the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five persons who wore the linen ephod. 
1SA.22.19	And Nob, the city of the priests, he put to the sword; both men and women, children and sucklings, oxen, asses and sheep, he put to the sword.
1SA.22.20	But one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after David. 
1SA.22.21	And Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the 
1SA.22.22	And David said to Abiathar, “I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I have occasioned the death of all the persons of your father's house. 
1SA.22.23	Stay with me, fear not; for he that seeks my life seeks your life; with me you shall be in safekeeping.”
1SA.23.1	Now they told David, “Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and are robbing the threshing floors.” 
1SA.23.2	Therefore David inquired of the 
1SA.23.3	But David's men said to him, “Behold, we are afraid here in Judah; how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?” 
1SA.23.4	Then David inquired of the 
1SA.23.5	And David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and made a great slaughter among them. So David delivered the inhabitants of Keilah.
1SA.23.6	When Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, he came down with an ephod in his hand. 
1SA.23.7	Now it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, “God has given him into my hand; for he has shut himself in by entering a town that has gates and bars.” 
1SA.23.8	And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men. 
1SA.23.9	David knew that Saul was plotting evil against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod here.” 
1SA.23.10	Then said David, “O 
1SA.23.11	Will the men of Keilah surrender me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as thy servant has heard? O 
1SA.23.12	Then said David, “Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul?” And the 
1SA.23.13	Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah, and they went wherever they could go. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up the expedition. 
1SA.23.14	And David remained in the strongholds in the wilderness, in the hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God did not give him into his hand.
1SA.23.15	And David was afraid because
1SA.23.16	And Jonathan, Saul's son, rose, and went to David at Horesh, and strengthened his hand in God. 
1SA.23.17	And he said to him, “Fear not; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you; you shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you; Saul my father also knows this.” 
1SA.23.18	And the two of them made a covenant before the 
1SA.23.19	Then the Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibe-ah, saying, “Does not David hide among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah, which is south of Jeshimon? 
1SA.23.20	Now come down, O king, according to all your heart's desire to come down; and our part shall be to surrender him into the king's hand.” 
1SA.23.21	And Saul said, “May you be blessed by the 
1SA.23.22	Go, make yet more sure; know and see the place where his haunt is, and who has seen him there; for it is told me that he is very cunning. 
1SA.23.23	See therefore, and take note of all the lurking places where he hides, and come back to me with sure information. Then I will go with you; and if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.” 
1SA.23.24	And they arose, and went to Ziph ahead of Saul.
1SA.23.24	Now David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon. 
1SA.23.25	And Saul and his men went to seek him. And David was told; therefore he went down to the rock which is
1SA.23.26	Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain; and David was making haste to get away from Saul, as Saul and his men were closing in upon David and his men to capture them, 
1SA.23.27	when a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Make haste and come; for the Philistines have made a raid upon the land.” 
1SA.23.28	So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines; therefore that place was called the Rock of Escape. 
1SA.23.29	 And David went up from there, and dwelt in the strongholds of En-gedi.
1SA.24.2	Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men in front of the Wildgoats' Rocks. 
1SA.24.3	And he came to the sheepfolds by the way, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the innermost parts of the cave. 
1SA.24.4	And the men of David said to him, “Here is the day of which the 
1SA.24.5	And afterward David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt. 
1SA.24.6	He said to his men, “The 
1SA.24.7	So David persuaded his men with these words, and did not permit them to attack Saul. And Saul rose up and left the cave, and went upon his way.
1SA.24.8	Afterward David also arose, and went out of the cave, and called after Saul, “My lord the king!” And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and did obeisance. 
1SA.24.9	And David said to Saul, “Why do you listen to the words of men who say, ‘Behold, David seeks your hurt’? 
1SA.24.10	Lo, this day your eyes have seen how the 
1SA.24.11	See, my father, see the skirt of your robe in my hand; for by the fact that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and did not kill you, you may know and see that there is no wrong or treason in my hands. I have not sinned against you, though you hunt my life to take it. 
1SA.24.12	May the 
1SA.24.13	As the proverb of the ancients says, ‘Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness’; but my hand shall not be against you. 
1SA.24.14	After whom has the king of Israel come out? After whom do you pursue? After a dead dog! After a flea! 
1SA.24.15	May the 
1SA.24.16	When David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” And Saul lifted up his voice and wept. 
1SA.24.17	He said to David, “You are more righteous than I; for you have repaid me good, whereas I have repaid you evil. 
1SA.24.18	And you have declared this day how you have dealt well with me, in that you did not kill me when the 
1SA.24.19	For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away safe? So may the 
1SA.24.20	And now, behold, I know that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand. 
1SA.24.21	Swear to me therefore by the 
1SA.24.22	And David swore this to Saul. Then Saul went home; but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
1SA.25.1	Now Samuel died; and all Israel assembled and mourned for him, and they buried him in his house at Ramah.
1SA.25.1	Then David rose and went down to the wilderness of Paran. 
1SA.25.2	And there was a man in Maon, whose business was in Carmel. The man was very rich; he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. He was shearing his sheep in Carmel. 
1SA.25.3	Now the name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife Abigail. The woman was of good understanding and beautiful, but the man was churlish and ill-behaved; he was a Calebite. 
1SA.25.4	David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep. 
1SA.25.5	So David sent ten young men; and David said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name. 
1SA.25.6	And thus you shall salute him: ‘Peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have. 
1SA.25.7	I hear that you have shearers; now your shepherds have been with us, and we did them no harm, and they missed nothing, all the time they were in Carmel. 
1SA.25.8	Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let my young men find favor in your eyes; for we come on a feast day. Pray, give whatever you have at hand to your servants and to your son David.’ ”
1SA.25.9	When David's young men came, they said all this to Nabal in the name of David; and then they waited. 
1SA.25.10	And Nabal answered David's servants, “Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants nowadays who are breaking away from their masters. 
1SA.25.11	Shall I take my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men who come from I do not know where?” 
1SA.25.12	So David's young men turned away, and came back and told him all this. 
1SA.25.13	And David said to his men, “Every man gird on his sword!” And every man of them girded on his sword; David also girded on his sword; and about four hundred men went up after David, while two hundred remained with the baggage.
1SA.25.14	But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, “Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed at them. 
1SA.25.15	Yet the men were very good to us, and we suffered no harm, and we did not miss anything when we were in the fields, as long as we went with them; 
1SA.25.16	they were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep. 
1SA.25.17	Now therefore know this and consider what you should do; for evil is determined against our master and against all his house, and he is so ill-natured that one cannot speak to him.”
1SA.25.18	Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two skins of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched grain, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses. 
1SA.25.19	And she said to her young men, “Go on before me; behold, I come after you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal. 
1SA.25.20	And as she rode on the ass, and came down under cover of the mountain, behold, David and his men came down toward her; and she met them. 
1SA.25.21	Now David had said, “Surely in vain have I guarded all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him; and he has returned me evil for good. 
1SA.25.22	God do so to David
1SA.25.23	When Abigail saw David, she made haste, and alighted from the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed to the ground. 
1SA.25.24	She fell at his feet and said, “Upon me alone, my lord, be the guilt; pray let your handmaid speak in your ears, and hear the words of your handmaid. 
1SA.25.25	Let not my lord regard this ill-natured fellow, Nabal; for as his name is, so is he; Nabal
1SA.25.26	Now then, my lord, as the 
1SA.25.27	And now let this present which your servant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who follow my lord. 
1SA.25.28	Pray forgive the trespass of your handmaid; for the 
1SA.25.29	If men rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living in the care of the 
1SA.25.30	And when the 
1SA.25.31	my lord shall have no cause of grief, or pangs of conscience, for having shed blood without cause or for my lord taking vengeance himself. And when the 
1SA.25.32	And David said to Abigail, “Blessed be the 
1SA.25.33	Blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you, who have kept me this day from bloodguilt and from avenging myself with my own hand! 
1SA.25.34	For as surely as the 
1SA.25.35	Then David received from her hand what she had brought him; and he said to her, “Go up in peace to your house; see, I have hearkened to your voice, and I have granted your petition.”
1SA.25.36	And Abigail came to Nabal; and lo, he was holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk; so she told him nothing at all until the morning light. 
1SA.25.37	And in the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone. 
1SA.25.38	And about ten days later the 
1SA.25.39	When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed be the 
1SA.25.40	And when the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel, they said to her, “David has sent us to you to take you to him as his wife.” 
1SA.25.41	And she rose and bowed with her face to the ground, and said, “Behold, your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.” 
1SA.25.42	And Abigail made haste and rose and mounted on an ass, and her five maidens attended her; she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.
1SA.25.43	David also took Ahino-am of Jezreel; and both of them became his wives. 
1SA.25.44	Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.
1SA.26.2	So Saul arose and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, with three thousand chosen men of Israel, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph. 
1SA.26.3	And Saul encamped on the hill of Hachilah, which is beside the road on the east of Jeshimon. But David remained in the wilderness; and when he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness, 
1SA.26.4	David sent out spies, and learned of a certainty that Saul had come. 
1SA.26.5	Then David rose and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David saw the place where Saul lay, with Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army; Saul was lying within the encampment, while the army was encamped around him.
1SA.26.6	Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Joab's brother Abishai the son of Zeruiah, “Who will go down with me into the camp to Saul?” And Abishai said, “I will go down with you.” 
1SA.26.7	So David and Abishai went to the army by night; and there lay Saul sleeping within the encampment, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the army lay around him. 
1SA.26.8	Then said Abishai to David, “God has given your enemy into your hand this day; now therefore let me pin him to the earth with one stroke of the spear, and I will not strike him twice.” 
1SA.26.9	But David said to Abishai, “Do not destroy him; for who can put forth his hand against the 
1SA.26.10	And David said, “As the 
1SA.26.11	The 
1SA.26.12	So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul's head; and they went away. No man saw it, or knew it, nor did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the 
1SA.26.13	Then David went over to the other side, and stood afar off on the top of the mountain, with a great space between them; 
1SA.26.14	and David called to the army, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, “Will you not answer, Abner?” Then Abner answered, “Who are you that calls to the king?” 
1SA.26.15	And David said to Abner, “Are you not a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept watch over your lord the king? For one of the people came in to destroy the king your lord. 
1SA.26.16	This thing that you have done is not good. As the 
1SA.26.17	Saul recognized David's voice, and said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” And David said, “It is my voice, my lord, O king.” 
1SA.26.18	And he said, “Why does my lord pursue after his servant? For what have I done? What guilt is on my hands? 
1SA.26.19	Now therefore let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it is the 
1SA.26.20	Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of the 
1SA.26.21	Then Saul said, “I have done wrong; return, my son David, for I will no more do you harm, because my life was precious in your eyes this day; behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.” 
1SA.26.22	And David made answer, “Here is the spear, O king! Let one of the young men come over and fetch it. 
1SA.26.23	The 
1SA.26.24	Behold, as your life was precious this day in my sight, so may my life be precious in the sight of the 
1SA.26.25	Then Saul said to David, “Blessed be you, my son David! You will do many things and will succeed in them.” So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.
1SA.27.1	And David said in his heart, “I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul; there is nothing better for me than that I should escape to the land of the Philistines; then Saul will despair of seeking me any longer within the borders of Israel, and I shall escape out of his hand.” 
1SA.27.2	So David arose and went over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath. 
1SA.27.3	And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, and David with his two wives, Ahino-am of Jezreel, and Abigail of Carmel, Nabal's widow. 
1SA.27.4	And when it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath, he sought for him no more.
1SA.27.5	Then David said to Achish, “If I have found favor in your eyes, let a place be given me in one of the country towns, that I may dwell there; for why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?” 
1SA.27.6	So that day Achish gave him Ziklag; therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day. 
1SA.27.7	And the number of the days that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a year and four months.
1SA.27.8	Now David and his men went up, and made raids upon the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for these were the inhabitants of the land from of old, as far as Shur, to the land of Egypt. 
1SA.27.9	And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, but took away the sheep, the oxen, the asses, the camels, and the garments, and came back to Achish. 
1SA.27.10	When Achish asked, “Against whom
1SA.27.11	And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to Gath, thinking, “Lest they should tell about us, and say, ‘So David has done.’ ” Such was his custom all the while he dwelt in the country of the Philistines. 
1SA.27.12	And Achish trusted David, thinking, “He has made himself utterly abhorred by his people Israel; therefore he shall be my servant always.”
1SA.28.1	In those days the Philistines gathered their forces for war, to fight against Israel. And Achish said to David, “Understand that you and your men are to go out with me in the army.” 
1SA.28.2	David said to Achish, “Very well, you shall know what your servant can do.” And Achish said to David, “Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life.”
1SA.28.3	Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had put the mediums and the wizards out of the land. 
1SA.28.4	The Philistines assembled, and came and encamped at Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel, and they encamped at Gilboa. 
1SA.28.5	When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly. 
1SA.28.6	And when Saul inquired of the 
1SA.28.7	Then Saul said to his servants, “Seek out for me a woman who is a medium, that I may go to her and inquire of her.” And his servants said to him, “Behold, there is a medium at Endor.”
1SA.28.8	So Saul disguised himself and put on other garments, and went, he and two men with him; and they came to the woman by night. And he said, “Divine for me by a spirit, and bring up for me whomever I shall name to you.” 
1SA.28.9	The woman said to him, “Surely you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off the mediums and the wizards from the land. Why then are you laying a snare for my life to bring about my death?” 
1SA.28.10	But Saul swore to her by the 
1SA.28.11	Then the woman said, “Whom shall I bring up for you?” He said, “Bring up Samuel for me.” 
1SA.28.12	When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice; and the woman said to Saul, “Why have you deceived me? You are Saul.” 
1SA.28.13	The king said to her, “Have no fear; what do you see?” And the woman said to Saul, “I see a god coming up out of the earth.” 
1SA.28.14	He said to her, “What is his appearance?” And she said, “An old man is coming up; and he is wrapped in a robe.” And Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance.
1SA.28.15	Then Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” Saul answered, “I am in great distress; for the Philistines are warring against me, and God has turned away from me and answers me no more, either by prophets or by dreams; therefore I have summoned you to tell me what I shall do.” 
1SA.28.16	And Samuel said, “Why then do you ask me, since the 
1SA.28.17	The 
1SA.28.18	Because you did not obey the voice of the 
1SA.28.19	Moreover the 
1SA.28.20	Then Saul fell at once full length upon the ground, filled with fear because of the words of Samuel; and there was no strength in him, for he had eaten nothing all day and all night. 
1SA.28.21	And the woman came to Saul, and when she saw that he was terrified, she said to him, “Behold, your handmaid has hearkened to you; I have taken my life in my hand, and have hearkened to what you have said to me. 
1SA.28.22	Now therefore, you also hearken to your handmaid; let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength when you go on your way.” 
1SA.28.23	He refused, and said, “I will not eat.” But his servants, together with the woman, urged him; and he hearkened to their words. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed. 
1SA.28.24	Now the woman had a fatted calf in the house, and she quickly killed it, and she took flour, and kneaded it and baked unleavened bread of it, 
1SA.28.25	and she put it before Saul and his servants; and they ate. Then they rose and went away that night.
1SA.29.1	Now the Philistines gathered all their forces at Aphek; and the Israelites were encamped by the fountain which is in Jezreel. 
1SA.29.2	As the lords of the Philistines were passing on by hundreds and by thousands, and David and his men were passing on in the rear with Achish, 
1SA.29.3	the commanders of the Philistines said, “What are these Hebrews doing here?” And Achish said to the commanders of the Philistines, “Is not this David, the servant of Saul, king of Israel, who has been with me now for days and years, and since he deserted to me I have found no fault in him to this day.” 
1SA.29.4	But the commanders of the Philistines were angry with him; and the commanders of the Philistines said to him, “Send the man back, that he may return to the place to which you have assigned him; he shall not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us. For how could this fellow reconcile himself to his lord? Would it not be with the heads of the men here? 
1SA.29.5	 Is not this David, of whom they sing to one another in dances,
1SA.29.5	‘Saul has slain his thousands,
1SA.29.5	and David his ten thousands’?”
1SA.29.6	Then Achish called David and said to him, “As the 
1SA.29.7	So go back now; and go peaceably, that you may not displease the lords of the Philistines.” 
1SA.29.8	And David said to Achish, “But what have I done? What have you found in your servant from the day I entered your service until now, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?” 
1SA.29.9	And Achish made answer to David, “I know that you are as blameless in my sight as an angel of God; nevertheless the commanders of the Philistines have said, ‘He shall not go up with us to the battle.’ 
1SA.29.10	Now then rise early in the morning with the servants of your lord who came with you; and start early in the morning, and depart as soon as you have light.” 
1SA.29.11	So David set out with his men early in the morning, to return to the land of the Philistines. But the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
1SA.30.1	Now when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had made a raid upon the Negeb and upon Ziklag. They had overcome Ziklag, and burned it with fire, 
1SA.30.2	and taken captive the women and all
1SA.30.3	And when David and his men came to the city, they found it burned with fire, and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive. 
1SA.30.4	Then David and the people who were with him raised their voices and wept, until they had no more strength to weep. 
1SA.30.5	David's two wives also had been taken captive, Ahino-am of Jezreel, and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel. 
1SA.30.6	And David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because all the people were bitter in soul, each for his sons and daughters. But David strengthened himself in the 
1SA.30.7	And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Bring me the ephod.” So Abiathar brought the ephod to David. 
1SA.30.8	And David inquired of the 
1SA.30.9	So David set out, and the six hundred men who were with him, and they came to the brook Besor, where those stayed who were left behind. 
1SA.30.10	But David went on with the pursuit, he and four hundred men; two hundred stayed behind, who were too exhausted to cross the brook Besor.
1SA.30.11	They found an Egyptian in the open country, and brought him to David; and they gave him bread and he ate, they gave him water to drink, 
1SA.30.12	and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins. And when he had eaten, his spirit revived; for he had not eaten bread or drunk water for three days and three nights. 
1SA.30.13	And David said to him, “To whom do you belong? And where are you from?” He said, “I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me behind because I fell sick three days ago. 
1SA.30.14	We had made a raid upon the Negeb of the Cherethites and upon that which belongs to Judah and upon the Negeb of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.” 
1SA.30.15	And David said to him, “Will you take me down to this band?” And he said, “Swear to me by God, that you will not kill me, or deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will take you down to this band.”
1SA.30.16	And when he had taken him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing, because of all the great spoil they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah. 
1SA.30.17	And David smote them from twilight until the evening of the next day; and not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men, who mounted camels and fled. 
1SA.30.18	David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives. 
1SA.30.19	Nothing was missing, whether small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything that had been taken; David brought back all. 
1SA.30.20	David also captured all the flocks and herds; and the people drove those cattle before him,
1SA.30.21	Then David came to the two hundred men, who had been too exhausted to follow David, and who had been left at the brook Besor; and they went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him; and when David drew near to the people he saluted them. 
1SA.30.22	Then all the wicked and base fellows among the men who had gone with David said, “Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoil which we have recovered, except that each man may lead away his wife and children, and depart.” 
1SA.30.23	But David said, “You shall not do so, my brothers, with what the 
1SA.30.24	Who would listen to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down into the battle, so shall his share be who stays by the baggage; they shall share alike.” 
1SA.30.25	And from that day forward he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.
1SA.30.26	When David came to Ziklag, he sent part of the spoil to his friends, the elders of Judah, saying, “Here is a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the 
1SA.30.27	it was for those in Bethel, in Ramoth of the Negeb, in Jattir, 
1SA.30.28	in Aroer, in Siphmoth, in Eshtemoa, 
1SA.30.29	in Racal, in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, in the cities of the Kenites, 
1SA.30.30	in Hormah, in Borashan, in Athach, 
1SA.30.31	in Hebron, for all the places where David and his men had roamed.
1SA.31.2	And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchishua, the sons of Saul. 
1SA.31.3	The battle pressed hard upon Saul, and the archers found him; and he was badly wounded by the archers. 
1SA.31.4	Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and make sport of me.” But his armor-bearer would not; for he feared greatly. Therefore Saul took his own sword, and fell upon it. 
1SA.31.5	And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword, and died with him. 
1SA.31.6	Thus Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor-bearer, and all his men, on the same day together. 
1SA.31.7	And when the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley and those beyond the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
1SA.31.8	On the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.9	And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines, to carry the good news to their idols
1SA.31.10	They put his armor in the temple of Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan. 
1SA.31.11	But when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, 
1SA.31.12	all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan; and they came to Jabesh and burnt them there. 
1SA.31.13	And they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
2SA.1.1	After the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, David remained two days in Ziklag; 
2SA.1.2	and on the third day, behold, a man came from Saul's camp, with his clothes rent and earth upon his head. And when he came to David, he fell to the ground and did obeisance. 
2SA.1.3	David said to him, “Where do you come from?” And he said to him, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.” 
2SA.1.4	And David said to him, “How did it go? Tell me.” And he answered, “The people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen and are dead; and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.” 
2SA.1.5	Then David said to the young man who told him, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?” 
2SA.1.6	 And the young man who told him said, “By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa; and there was Saul leaning upon his spear; and lo, the chariots and the horsemen were close upon him. 
2SA.1.7	And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, ‘Here I am.’ 
2SA.1.8	And he said to me, ‘Who are you?’ I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’ 
2SA.1.9	And he said to me, ‘Stand beside me and slay me; for anguish has seized me, and yet my life still lingers.’ 
2SA.1.10	So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen; and I took the crown which was on his head and the armlet which was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.”
2SA.1.11	Then David took hold of his clothes, and rent them; and so did all the men who were with him; 
2SA.1.12	and they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of the 
2SA.1.13	And David said to the young man who told him, “Where do you come from?” And he answered, “I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite.” 
2SA.1.14	David said to him, “How is it you were not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy the 
2SA.1.15	Then David called one of the young men and said, “Go, fall upon him.” And he smote him so that he died. 
2SA.1.16	And David said to him, “Your blood be upon your head; for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I have slain the 
2SA.1.17	And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and Jonathan his son, 
2SA.1.18	and he said it
2SA.1.19	“Thy glory, O Israel, is slain upon thy high places!
2SA.1.19	How are the mighty fallen!
2SA.1.20	Tell it not in Gath,
2SA.1.20	publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon;
2SA.1.20	lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,
2SA.1.20	lest the daughters of the uncircumcised exult.
2SA.1.21	“Ye mountains of Gilboa,
2SA.1.21	let there be no dew or rain upon you,
2SA.1.21	nor upsurging of the deep!
2SA.1.21	For there the shield of the mighty was defiled,
2SA.1.21	the shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.
2SA.1.22	“From the blood of the slain,
2SA.1.22	from the fat of the mighty,
2SA.1.22	the bow of Jonathan turned not back,
2SA.1.22	and the sword of Saul returned not empty.
2SA.1.23	“Saul and Jonathan, beloved and lovely!
2SA.1.23	In life and in death they were not divided;
2SA.1.23	they were swifter than eagles,
2SA.1.23	they were stronger than lions.
2SA.1.24	“Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,
2SA.1.24	who clothed you daintily in scarlet,
2SA.1.24	who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
2SA.1.25	“How are the mighty fallen
2SA.1.25	in the midst of the battle!
2SA.1.25	“Jonathan lies slain upon thy high places.
2SA.1.26	I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan;
2SA.1.26	very pleasant have you been to me;
2SA.1.26	your love to me was wonderful,
2SA.1.26	passing the love of women.
2SA.1.27	“How are the mighty fallen,
2SA.1.27	and the weapons of war perished!”
2SA.2.1	After this David inquired of the 
2SA.2.2	So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahino-am of Jezreel, and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel. 
2SA.2.3	And David brought up his men who were with him, every one with his household; and they dwelt in the towns of Hebron. 
2SA.2.4	And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah.
2SA.2.4	When they told David, “It was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul,” 
2SA.2.5	David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said to them, “May you be blessed by the 
2SA.2.6	Now may the 
2SA.2.7	Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.”
2SA.2.8	Now Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul's army, had taken Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim; 
2SA.2.9	and he made him king over Gilead and the Ashurites and Jezreel and Ephraim and Benjamin and all Israel. 
2SA.2.10	Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David. 
2SA.2.11	And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
2SA.2.12	Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. 
2SA.2.13	And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool. 
2SA.2.14	And Abner said to Joab, “Let the young men arise and play before us.” And Joab said, “Let them arise.” 
2SA.2.15	Then they arose and passed over by number, twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David. 
2SA.2.16	And each caught his opponent by the head, and thrust his sword in his opponent's side; so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim,
2SA.2.17	And the battle was very fierce that day; and Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David.
2SA.2.18	And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Now Asahel was as swift of foot as a wild gazelle; 
2SA.2.19	and Asahel pursued Abner, and as he went he turned neither to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner. 
2SA.2.20	Then Abner looked behind him and said, “Is it you, Asahel?” And he answered, “It is I.” 
2SA.2.21	Abner said to him, “Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and seize one of the young men, and take his spoil.” But Asahel would not turn aside from following him. 
2SA.2.22	And Abner said again to Asahel, “Turn aside from following me; why should I smite you to the ground? How then could I lift up my face to your brother Joab?” 
2SA.2.23	But he refused to turn aside; therefore Abner smote him in the belly with the butt of his spear, so that the spear came out at his back; and he fell there, and died where he was. And all who came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died, stood still.
2SA.2.24	But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner; and as the sun was going down they came to the hill of Ammah, which lies before Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon. 
2SA.2.25	And the Benjaminites gathered themselves together behind Abner, and became one band, and took their stand on the top of a hill. 
2SA.2.26	Then Abner called to Joab, “Shall the sword devour for ever? Do you not know that the end will be bitter? How long will it be before you bid your people turn from the pursuit of their brethren?” 
2SA.2.27	And Joab said, “As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely the men would have given up the pursuit of their brethren in the morning.” 
2SA.2.28	So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the men stopped, and pursued Israel no more, nor did they fight any more.
2SA.2.29	And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; they crossed the Jordan, and marching the whole forenoon they came to Mahanaim. 
2SA.2.30	Joab returned from the pursuit of Abner; and when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing of David's servants nineteen men besides Asahel. 
2SA.2.31	But the servants of David had slain of Benjamin three hundred and sixty of Abner's men. 
2SA.2.32	And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was at Bethlehem. And Joab and his men marched all night, and the day broke upon them at Hebron.
2SA.3.1	There was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David; and David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul became weaker and weaker.
2SA.3.3	and his second, Chile-ab, of Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; 
2SA.3.4	and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; 
2SA.3.5	and the sixth, Ithre-am, of Eglah, David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
2SA.3.6	While there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner was making himself strong in the house of Saul. 
2SA.3.7	Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah; and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, “Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?” 
2SA.3.8	Then Abner was very angry over the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, “Am I a dog's head of Judah? This day I keep showing loyalty to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not given you into the hand of David; and yet you charge me today with a fault concerning a woman. 
2SA.3.9	God do so to Abner and more also, if I do not accomplish for David what the 
2SA.3.10	to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beer-sheba.” 
2SA.3.11	And Ish-bosheth could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.
2SA.3.12	And Abner sent messengers to David at Hebron,
2SA.3.13	And he said, “Good; I will make a covenant with you; but one thing I require of you; that is, you shall not see my face, unless you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see my face.” 
2SA.3.14	Then David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth Saul's son, saying, “Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed at the price of a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.” 
2SA.3.15	And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband Palti-el the son of Laish. 
2SA.3.16	But her husband went with her, weeping after her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go, return”; and he returned.
2SA.3.17	And Abner conferred with the elders of Israel, saying, “For some time past you have been seeking David as king over you. 
2SA.3.18	Now then bring it about; for the 
2SA.3.19	Abner also spoke to Benjamin; and then Abner went to tell David at Hebron all that Israel and the whole house of Benjamin thought good to do.
2SA.3.20	When Abner came with twenty men to David at Hebron, David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him. 
2SA.3.21	And Abner said to David, “I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your heart desires.” So David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
2SA.3.22	Just then the servants of David arrived with Joab from a raid, bringing much spoil with them. But Abner was not with David at Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace. 
2SA.3.23	When Joab and all the army that was with him came, it was told Joab, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has let him go, and he has gone in peace.” 
2SA.3.24	Then Joab went to the king and said, “What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you; why is it that you have sent him away, so that he is gone? 
2SA.3.25	You know that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you are doing.”
2SA.3.26	When Joab came out from David's presence, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern of Sirah; but David did not know about it. 
2SA.3.27	And when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him privately, and there he smote him in the belly, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother. 
2SA.3.28	Afterward, when David heard of it, he said, “I and my kingdom are for ever guiltless before the 
2SA.3.29	May it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father's house; and may the house of Joab never be without one who has a discharge, or who is leprous, or who holds a spindle, or who is slain by the sword, or who lacks bread!” 
2SA.3.30	So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.
2SA.3.31	Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, “Rend your clothes, and gird on sackcloth, and mourn before Abner.” And King David followed the bier. 
2SA.3.32	They buried Abner at Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept. 
2SA.3.33	And the king lamented for Abner, saying,
2SA.3.33	“Should Abner die as a fool dies?
2SA.3.34	Your hands were not bound,
2SA.3.34	your feet were not fettered;
2SA.3.34	as one falls before the wicked
2SA.3.34	you have fallen.”
2SA.3.34	And all the people wept again over him. 
2SA.3.35	Then all the people came to persuade David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying, “God do so to me and more also, if I taste bread or anything else till the sun goes down!” 
2SA.3.36	And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as everything that the king did pleased all the people. 
2SA.3.37	So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the king's will to slay Abner the son of Ner. 
2SA.3.38	And the king said to his servants, “Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel? 
2SA.3.39	And I am this day weak, though anointed king; these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me. The 
2SA.4.1	When Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, heard that Abner had died at Hebron, his courage failed, and all Israel was dismayed. 
2SA.4.2	Now Saul's son had two men who were captains of raiding bands; the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon a man of Benjamin from Be-eroth (for Be-eroth also is reckoned to Benjamin; 
2SA.4.3	the Be-erothites fled to Gittaim, and have been sojourners there to this day).
2SA.4.4	Jonathan, the son of Saul, had a son who was crippled in his feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel; and his nurse took him up, and fled; and, as she fled in her haste, he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.
2SA.4.5	Now the sons of Rimmon the Be-erothite, Rechab and Baanah, set out, and about the heat of the day they came to the house of Ish-bosheth, as he was taking his noonday rest. 
2SA.4.6	And behold, the doorkeeper of the house had been cleaning wheat, but she grew drowsy and slept; so Rechab and Baanah his brother slipped in.
2SA.4.7	When they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him. They took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night, 
2SA.4.8	and brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron. And they said to the king, “Here is the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life; the 
2SA.4.9	But David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Be-erothite, “As the 
2SA.4.10	when one told me, ‘Behold, Saul is dead,’ and thought he was bringing good news, I seized him and slew him at Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news. 
2SA.4.11	How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous man in his own house upon his bed, shall I not now require his blood at your hand, and destroy you from the earth?” 
2SA.4.12	And David commanded his young men, and they killed them, and cut off their hands and feet, and hanged them beside the pool at Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the tomb of Abner at Hebron.
2SA.5.2	In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you that led out and brought in Israel; and the 
2SA.5.3	So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron; and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the 
2SA.5.4	 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years. 
2SA.5.5	At Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and at Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.
2SA.5.7	Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David. 
2SA.5.8	And David said on that day, “Whoever would smite the Jebusites, let him get up the water shaft to attack the lame and the blind, who are hated by David's soul.” Therefore it is said, “The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.” 
2SA.5.9	And David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built the city round about from the Millo inward. 
2SA.5.10	And David became greater and greater, for the 
2SA.5.12	And David perceived that the 
2SA.5.13	And David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron; and more sons and daughters were born to David. 
2SA.5.14	 And these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammu-a, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
2SA.5.15	Ibhar, Elishu-a, Nepheg, Japhia, 
2SA.5.16	Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
2SA.5.18	Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.5.19	And David inquired of the 
2SA.5.20	And David came to Baal-perazim, and David defeated them there; and he said, “The 
2SA.5.21	And the Philistines left their idols there, and David and his men carried them away.
2SA.5.23	And when David inquired of the 
2SA.5.24	And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then bestir yourself; for then the 
2SA.5.25	And David did as the 
2SA.6.2	And David arose and went with all the people who were with him from Baale-judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the name of the 
2SA.6.3	And they carried the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio,
2SA.6.4	with the ark of God; and Ahio
2SA.6.5	And David and all the house of Israel were making merry before the 
2SA.6.6	And when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah put out his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled. 
2SA.6.7	And the anger of the 
2SA.6.8	And David was angry because the 
2SA.6.9	And David was afraid of the 
2SA.6.10	So David was not willing to take the ark of the 
2SA.6.11	And the ark of the 
2SA.6.13	and when those who bore the ark of the 
2SA.6.14	And David danced before the 
2SA.6.15	So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the 
2SA.6.16	As the ark of the 
2SA.6.17	And they brought in the ark of the 
2SA.6.18	And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the 
2SA.6.19	and distributed among all the people, the whole multitude of Israel, both men and women, to each a cake of bread, a portion of meat,
2SA.6.20	And David returned to bless his household. But Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, “How the king of Israel honored himself today, uncovering himself today before the eyes of his servants' maids, as one of the vulgar fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!” 
2SA.6.21	And David said to Michal, “It was before the 
2SA.6.22	I will make myself yet more contemptible than this, and I will be abased in your
2SA.6.23	And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.
2SA.7.2	the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells in a tent.” 
2SA.7.3	And Nathan said to the king, “Go, do all that is in your heart; for the 
2SA.7.4	But that same night the word of the 
2SA.7.5	“Go and tell my servant David, ‘Thus says the 
2SA.7.6	I have not dwelt in a house since the day I brought up the people of Israel from Egypt to this day, but I have been moving about in a tent for my dwelling. 
2SA.7.7	In all places where I have moved with all the people of Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges
2SA.7.8	Now therefore thus you shall say to my servant David, ‘Thus says the 
2SA.7.9	and I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth. 
2SA.7.10	And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be disturbed no more; and violent men shall afflict them no more, as formerly, 
2SA.7.11	from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel; and I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover the 
2SA.7.12	When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come forth from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. 
2SA.7.13	He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever. 
2SA.7.14	 I will be his father, and he shall be my son. When he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men; 
2SA.7.15	but I will not take
2SA.7.16	And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure for ever before me; your throne shall be established for ever.’ ” 
2SA.7.17	In accordance with all these words, and in accordance with all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.
2SA.7.18	Then King David went in and sat before the 
2SA.7.19	And yet this was a small thing in thy eyes, O Lord 
2SA.7.20	And what more can David say to thee? For thou knowest thy servant, O Lord 
2SA.7.21	Because of thy promise, and according to thy own heart, thou hast wrought all this greatness, to make thy servant know it. 
2SA.7.22	Therefore thou art great, O 
2SA.7.23	What other
2SA.7.24	And thou didst establish for thyself thy people Israel to be thy people for ever; and thou, O 
2SA.7.25	And now, O 
2SA.7.26	and thy name will be magnified for ever, saying, ‘The 
2SA.7.27	For thou, O 
2SA.7.28	And now, O Lord 
2SA.7.29	now therefore may it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee; for thou, O Lord 
2SA.8.2	And he defeated Moab, and measured them with a line, making them lie down on the ground; two lines he measured to be put to death, and one full line to be spared. And the Moabites became servants to David and brought tribute.
2SA.8.3	David also defeated Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to restore his power at the river Euphrates. 
2SA.8.4	And David took from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but left enough for a hundred chariots. 
2SA.8.5	And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew twenty-two thousand men of the Syrians. 
2SA.8.6	Then David put garrisons in Aram of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David and brought tribute. And the 
2SA.8.7	And David took the shields of gold which were carried by the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 
2SA.8.8	And from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took very much bronze.
2SA.8.9	When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the whole army of Hadadezer, 
2SA.8.10	Toi sent his son Joram to King David, to greet him, and to congratulate him because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him; for Hadadezer had often been at war with Toi. And Joram brought with him articles of silver, of gold, and of bronze; 
2SA.8.11	these also King David dedicated to the 
2SA.8.12	from Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, Amalek, and from the spoil of Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
2SA.8.13	And David won a name for himself. When he returned, he slew eighteen thousand Edomites
2SA.8.14	And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom he put garrisons, and all the Edomites became David's servants. And the 
2SA.8.16	And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; 
2SA.8.17	and Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were priests; and Seraiah was secretary; 
2SA.8.18	and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over
2SA.9.1	And David said, “Is there still any one left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?” 
2SA.9.2	Now there was a servant of the house of Saul whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David; and the king said to him, “Are you Ziba?” And he said, “Your servant is he.” 
2SA.9.3	And the king said, “Is there not still some one of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God to him?” Ziba said to the king, “There is still a son of Jonathan; he is crippled in his feet.” 
2SA.9.4	The king said to him, “Where is he?” And Ziba said to the king, “He is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, at Lo-debar.” 
2SA.9.5	Then King David sent and brought him from the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, at Lo-debar. 
2SA.9.6	And Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, son of Saul, came to David, and fell on his face and did obeisance. And David said, “Mephibosheth!” And he answered, “Behold, your servant.” 
2SA.9.7	And David said to him, “Do not fear; for I will show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan, and I will restore to you all the land of Saul your father; and you shall eat at my table always.” 
2SA.9.8	And he did obeisance, and said, “What is your servant, that you should look upon a dead dog such as I?”
2SA.9.9	Then the king called Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, “All that belonged to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master's son. 
2SA.9.10	And you and your sons and your servants shall till the land for him, and shall bring in the produce, that your master's son may have bread to eat; but Mephibosheth your master's son shall always eat at my table.” Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. 
2SA.9.11	Then Ziba said to the king, “According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so will your servant do.” So Mephibosheth ate at David's
2SA.9.12	And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all who dwelt in Ziba's house became Mephibosheth's servants. 
2SA.9.13	So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem; for he ate always at the king's table. Now he was lame in both his feet.
2SA.10.2	And David said, “I will deal loyally with Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father dealt loyally with me.” So David sent by his servants to console him concerning his father. And David's servants came into the land of the Ammonites. 
2SA.10.3	But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think, because David has sent comforters to you, that he is honoring your father? Has not David sent his servants to you to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?” 
2SA.10.4	So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off half the beard of each, and cut off their garments in the middle, at their hips, and sent them away. 
2SA.10.5	When it was told David, he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, “Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.”
2SA.10.6	When the Ammonites saw that they had become odious to David, the Ammonites sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand foot soldiers, and the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and the men of Tob, twelve thousand men. 
2SA.10.7	And when David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the host of the mighty men. 
2SA.10.8	And the Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the gate; and the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the open country.
2SA.10.9	When Joab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the picked men of Israel, and arrayed them against the Syrians; 
2SA.10.10	the rest of his men he put in the charge of Abishai his brother, and he arrayed them against the Ammonites. 
2SA.10.11	And he said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come and help you. 
2SA.10.12	Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people, and for the cities of our God; and may the 
2SA.10.13	So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to battle against the Syrians; and they fled before him. 
2SA.10.14	And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered the city. Then Joab returned from fighting against the Ammonites, and came to Jerusalem.
2SA.10.15	But when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together. 
2SA.10.16	And Hadadezer sent, and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the Euphrates;
2SA.10.17	And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and crossed the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians arrayed themselves against David, and fought with him. 
2SA.10.18	And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians the men of seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and wounded Shobach the commander of their army, so that he died there. 
2SA.10.19	And when all the kings who were servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel, and became subject to them. So the Syrians feared to help the Ammonites any more.
2SA.11.2	It happened, late one afternoon, when David arose from his couch and was walking upon the roof of the king's house, that he saw from the roof a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful. 
2SA.11.3	And David sent and inquired about the woman. And one said, “Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?” 
2SA.11.4	So David sent messengers, and took her; and she came to him, and he lay with her. (Now she was purifying herself from her uncleanness.) Then she returned to her house. 
2SA.11.5	And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, “I am with child.”
2SA.11.6	So David sent word to Joab, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” And Joab sent Uriah to David. 
2SA.11.7	When Uriah came to him, David asked how Joab was doing, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered. 
2SA.11.8	Then David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house, and wash your feet.” And Uriah went out of the king's house, and there followed him a present from the king. 
2SA.11.9	But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house. 
2SA.11.10	When they told David, “Uriah did not go down to his house,” David said to Uriah, “Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?” 
2SA.11.11	Uriah said to David, “The ark and Israel and Judah dwell in booths; and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field; shall I then go to my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.” 
2SA.11.12	Then David said to Uriah, “Remain here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart.” So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day, and the next. 
2SA.11.13	And David invited him, and he ate in his presence and drank, so that he made him drunk; and in the evening he went out to lie on his couch with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.
2SA.11.14	In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah. 
2SA.11.15	In the letter he wrote, “Set Uriah in the forefront of the hardest fighting, and then draw back from him, that he may be struck down, and die.” 
2SA.11.16	And as Joab was besieging the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew there were valiant men. 
2SA.11.17	And the men of the city came out and fought with Joab; and some of the servants of David among the people fell. Uriah the Hittite was slain also. 
2SA.11.18	Then Joab sent and told David all the news about the fighting; 
2SA.11.19	and he instructed the messenger, “When you have finished telling all the news about the fighting to the king, 
2SA.11.20	then, if the king's anger rises, and if he says to you, ‘Why did you go so near the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall? 
2SA.11.21	Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman cast an upper millstone upon him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?’ then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.’ ”
2SA.11.22	So the messenger went, and came and told David all that Joab had sent him to tell. 
2SA.11.23	The messenger said to David, “The men gained an advantage over us, and came out against us in the field; but we drove them back to the entrance of the gate. 
2SA.11.24	Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall; some of the king's servants are dead; and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.” 
2SA.11.25	David said to the messenger, “Thus shall you say to Joab, ‘Do not let this matter trouble you, for the sword devours now one and now another; strengthen your attack upon the city, and overthrow it.’ And encourage him.”
2SA.11.26	When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband. 
2SA.11.27	And when the mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the 
2SA.12.1	And the 
2SA.12.2	The rich man had very many flocks and herds; 
2SA.12.3	but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb, which he had bought. And he brought it up, and it grew up with him and with his children; it used to eat of his morsel, and drink from his cup, and lie in his bosom, and it was like a daughter to him. 
2SA.12.4	Now there came a traveler to the rich man, and he was unwilling to take one of his own flock or herd to prepare for the wayfarer who had come to him, but he took the poor man's lamb, and prepared it for the man who had come to him.” 
2SA.12.5	Then David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, “As the 
2SA.12.6	and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.”
2SA.12.7	Nathan said to David, “You are the man. Thus says the 
2SA.12.8	and I gave you your master's house, and your master's wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if this were too little, I would add to you as much more. 
2SA.12.9	Why have you despised the word of the 
2SA.12.10	Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.’ 
2SA.12.11	Thus says the 
2SA.12.12	For you did it secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.’ ” 
2SA.12.13	David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the 
2SA.12.14	Nevertheless, because by this deed you have utterly scorned the 
2SA.12.15	Then Nathan went to his house.
2SA.12.15	And the 
2SA.12.16	David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in and lay all night upon the ground. 
2SA.12.17	And the elders of his house stood beside him, to raise him from the ground; but he would not, nor did he eat food with them. 
2SA.12.18	On the seventh day the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, “Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he did not listen to us; how then can we say to him the child is dead? He may do himself some harm.” 
2SA.12.19	But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?” They said, “He is dead.” 
2SA.12.20	Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his clothes; and he went into the house of the 
2SA.12.21	Then his servants said to him, “What is this thing that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while it was alive; but when the child died, you arose and ate food.” 
2SA.12.22	He said, “While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, ‘Who knows whether the 
2SA.12.23	But now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.”
2SA.12.24	Then David comforted his wife, Bathsheba, and went in to her, and lay with her; and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. And the 
2SA.12.25	and sent a message by Nathan the prophet; so he called his name Jedidiah,
2SA.12.27	And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, “I have fought against Rabbah; moreover, I have taken the city of waters. 
2SA.12.28	Now, then, gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called by my name.” 
2SA.12.29	So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah, and fought against it and took it. 
2SA.12.30	And he took the crown of their king
2SA.12.31	And he brought forth the people who were in it, and set them to labor with saws and iron picks and iron axes, and made them toil at
2SA.13.1	Now Absalom, David's son, had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and after a time Amnon, David's son, loved her. 
2SA.13.2	And Amnon was so tormented that he made himself ill because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible to Amnon to do anything to her. 
2SA.13.3	But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shime-ah, David's brother; and Jonadab was a very crafty man. 
2SA.13.4	And he said to him, “O son of the king, why are you so haggard morning after morning? Will you not tell me?” Amnon said to him, “I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.” 
2SA.13.5	Jonadab said to him, “Lie down on your bed, and pretend to be ill; and when your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.’ ” 
2SA.13.6	So Amnon lay down, and pretended to be ill; and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Pray let my sister Tamar come and make a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.”
2SA.13.7	Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, “Go to your brother Amnon's house, and prepare food for him.” 
2SA.13.8	So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house, where he was lying down. And she took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes. 
2SA.13.9	And she took the pan and emptied it out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, “Send out every one from me.” So every one went out from him. 
2SA.13.10	Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from your hand.” And Tamar took the cakes she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother. 
2SA.13.11	But when she brought them near him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, “Come, lie with me, my sister.” 
2SA.13.12	She answered him, “No, my brother, do not force me; for such a thing is not done in Israel; do not do this wanton folly. 
2SA.13.13	As for me, where could I carry my shame? And as for you, you would be as one of the wanton fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray you, speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.” 
2SA.13.14	But he would not listen to her; and being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.
2SA.13.15	Then Amnon hated her with very great hatred; so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, “Arise, be gone.” 
2SA.13.16	But she said to him, “No, my brother; for this wrong in sending me away is greater than the other which you did to me.”
2SA.13.17	He called the young man who served him and said, “Put this woman out of my presence, and bolt the door after her.” 
2SA.13.18	Now she was wearing a long robe with sleeves; for thus were the virgin daughters of the king clad of old.
2SA.13.19	And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent the long robe which she wore; and she laid her hand on her head, and went away, crying aloud as she went.
2SA.13.20	And her brother Absalom said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with you? Now hold your peace, my sister; he is your brother; do not take this to heart.” So Tamar dwelt, a desolate woman, in her brother Absalom's house. 
2SA.13.21	When King David heard of all these things, he was very angry. 
2SA.13.22	But Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
2SA.13.23	After two full years Absalom had sheepshearers at Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king's sons. 
2SA.13.24	And Absalom came to the king, and said, “Behold, your servant has sheepshearers; pray let the king and his servants go with your servant.” 
2SA.13.25	But the king said to Absalom, “No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you.” He pressed him, but he would not go but gave him his blessing. 
2SA.13.26	Then Absalom said, “If not, pray let my brother Amnon go with us.” And the king said to him, “Why should he go with you?” 
2SA.13.27	But Absalom pressed him until he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him. 
2SA.13.28	Then Absalom commanded his servants, “Mark when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, ‘Strike Amnon,’ then kill him. Fear not; have I not commanded you? Be courageous and be valiant.” 
2SA.13.29	So the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and each mounted his mule and fled.
2SA.13.30	While they were on the way, tidings came to David, “Absalom has slain all the king's sons, and not one of them is left.” 
2SA.13.31	Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants who were standing by rent their garments. 
2SA.13.32	But Jonadab the son of Shime-ah, David's brother, said, “Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king's sons, for Amnon alone is dead, for by the command of Absalom this has been determined from the day he forced his sister Tamar. 
2SA.13.33	Now therefore let not my lord the king so take it to heart as to suppose that all the king's sons are dead; for Amnon alone is dead.”
2SA.13.34	But Absalom fled. And the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people were coming from the Horonaim road
2SA.13.35	And Jonadab said to the king, “Behold, the king's sons have come; as your servant said, so it has come about.” 
2SA.13.36	And as soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept; and the king also and all his servants wept very bitterly.
2SA.13.37	But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son day after day. 
2SA.13.38	So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years. 
2SA.13.39	And the spirit
2SA.14.1	Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart went out to Absalom. 
2SA.14.2	And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched from there a wise woman, and said to her, “Pretend to be a mourner, and put on mourning garments; do not anoint yourself with oil, but behave like a woman who has been mourning many days for the dead; 
2SA.14.3	and go to the king, and speak thus to him.” So Joab put the words in her mouth.
2SA.14.4	When the woman of Tekoa came to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, “Help, O king.” 
2SA.14.5	And the king said to her, “What is your trouble?” She answered, “Alas, I am a widow; my husband is dead. 
2SA.14.6	And your handmaid had two sons, and they quarreled with one another in the field; there was no one to part them, and one struck the other and killed him. 
2SA.14.7	And now the whole family has risen against your handmaid, and they say, ‘Give up the man who struck his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew’; and so they would destroy the heir also. Thus they would quench my coal which is left, and leave to my husband neither name nor remnant upon the face of the earth.”
2SA.14.8	Then the king said to the woman, “Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you.” 
2SA.14.9	And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, “On me be the guilt, my lord the king, and on my father's house; let the king and his throne be guiltless.” 
2SA.14.10	The king said, “If any one says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall never touch you again.” 
2SA.14.11	Then she said, “Pray let the king invoke the 
2SA.14.12	Then the woman said, “Pray let your handmaid speak a word to my lord the king.” He said, “Speak.” 
2SA.14.13	And the woman said, “Why then have you planned such a thing against the people of God? For in giving this decision the king convicts himself, inasmuch as the king does not bring his banished one home again. 
2SA.14.14	We must all die, we are like water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; but God will not take away the life of him who devises
2SA.14.15	Now I have come to say this to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid; and your handmaid thought, ‘I will speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant. 
2SA.14.16	For the king will hear, and deliver his servant from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together from the heritage of God.’ 
2SA.14.17	And your handmaid thought, ‘The word of my lord the king will set me at rest’; for my lord the king is like the angel of God to discern good and evil. The 
2SA.14.18	Then the king answered the woman, “Do not hide from me anything I ask you.” And the woman said, “Let my lord the king speak.” 
2SA.14.19	The king said, “Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?” The woman answered and said, “As surely as you live, my lord the king, one cannot turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has said. It was your servant Joab who bade me; it was he who put all these words in the mouth of your handmaid. 
2SA.14.20	In order to change the course of affairs your servant Joab did this. But my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God to know all things that are on the earth.”
2SA.14.21	Then the king said to Joab, “Behold now, I grant this; go, bring back the young man Absalom.” 
2SA.14.22	And Joab fell on his face to the ground, and did obeisance, and blessed the king; and Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord the king, in that the king has granted the request of his servant.” 
2SA.14.23	So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. 
2SA.14.24	And the king said, “Let him dwell apart in his own house; he is not to come into my presence.” So Absalom dwelt apart in his own house, and did not come into the king's presence.
2SA.14.25	Now in all Israel there was no one so much to be praised for his beauty as Absalom; from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. 
2SA.14.26	And when he cut the hair of his head (for at the end of every year he used to cut it; when it was heavy on him, he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head, two hundred shekels by the king's weight. 
2SA.14.27	There were born to Absalom three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar; she was a beautiful woman.
2SA.14.28	So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, without coming into the king's presence. 
2SA.14.29	Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but Joab would not come to him. And he sent a second time, but Joab would not come. 
2SA.14.30	Then he said to his servants, “See, Joab's field is next to mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.” So Absalom's servants set the field on fire. 
2SA.14.31	Then Joab arose and went to Absalom at his house, and said to him, “Why have your servants set my field on fire?” 
2SA.14.32	Absalom answered Joab, “Behold, I sent word to you, ‘Come here, that I may send you to the king, to ask, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still.” Now therefore let me go into the presence of the king; and if there is guilt in me, let him kill me.’ ” 
2SA.14.33	Then Joab went to the king, and told him; and he summoned Absalom. So he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom.
2SA.15.1	After this Absalom got himself a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him. 
2SA.15.2	And Absalom used to rise early and stand beside the way of the gate; and when any man had a suit to come before the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him, and say, “From what city are you?” And when he said, “Your servant is of such and such a tribe in Israel,” 
2SA.15.3	Absalom would say to him, “See, your claims are good and right; but there is no man deputed by the king to hear you.” 
2SA.15.4	Absalom said moreover, “Oh that I were judge in the land! Then every man with a suit or cause might come to me, and I would give him justice.” 
2SA.15.5	And whenever a man came near to do obeisance to him, he would put out his hand, and take hold of him, and kiss him. 
2SA.15.6	Thus Absalom did to all of Israel who came to the king for judgment; so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
2SA.15.7	And at the end of four
2SA.15.8	For your servant vowed a vow while I dwelt at Geshur in Aram, saying, ‘If the 
2SA.15.9	The king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he arose, and went to Hebron. 
2SA.15.10	But Absalom sent secret messengers throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then say, ‘Absalom is king at Hebron!’ ” 
2SA.15.11	With Absalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem who were invited guests, and they went in their simplicity, and knew nothing. 
2SA.15.12	And while Absalom was offering the sacrifices, he sent for
2SA.15.13	And a messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom.” 
2SA.15.14	Then David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, “Arise, and let us flee; or else there will be no escape for us from Absalom; go in haste, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.” 
2SA.15.15	And the king's servants said to the king, “Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king decides.” 
2SA.15.16	So the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten concubines to keep the house. 
2SA.15.17	And the king went forth, and all the people after him; and they halted at the last house. 
2SA.15.18	And all his servants passed by him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the six hundred Gittites who had followed him from Gath, passed on before the king.
2SA.15.19	Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why do you also go with us? Go back, and stay with the king; for you are a foreigner, and also an exile from
2SA.15.20	You came only yesterday, and shall I today make you wander about with us, seeing I go I know not where? Go back, and take your brethren with you; and may the 
2SA.15.21	But Ittai answered the king, “As the 
2SA.15.22	And David said to Ittai, “Go then, pass on.” So Ittai the Gittite passed on, with all his men and all the little ones who were with him. 
2SA.15.23	And all the country wept aloud as all the people passed by, and the king crossed the brook Kidron, and all the people passed on toward the wilderness.
2SA.15.24	And Abiathar came up, and lo, Zadok came also, with all the Levites, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God, until the people had all passed out of the city. 
2SA.15.25	Then the king said to Zadok, “Carry the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the 
2SA.15.26	but if he says, ‘I have no pleasure in you,’ behold, here I am, let him do to me what seems good to him.” 
2SA.15.27	The king also said to Zadok the priest, “Look,
2SA.15.28	See, I will wait at the fords of the wilderness, until word comes from you to inform me.” 
2SA.15.29	So Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem; and they remained there.
2SA.15.30	But David went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went, barefoot and with his head covered; and all the people who were with him covered their heads, and they went up, weeping as they went. 
2SA.15.31	And it was told David, “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.” And David said, “O 
2SA.15.32	When David came to the summit, where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent and earth upon his head. 
2SA.15.33	David said to him, “If you go on with me, you will be a burden to me. 
2SA.15.34	But if you return to the city, and say to Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father's servant in time past, so now I will be your servant,’ then you will defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel. 
2SA.15.35	Are not Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there? So whatever you hear from the king's house, tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. 
2SA.15.36	Behold, their two sons are with them there, Ahima-az, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son; and by them you shall send to me everything you hear.” 
2SA.15.37	So Hushai, David's friend, came into the city, just as Absalom was entering Jerusalem.
2SA.16.1	When David had passed a little beyond the summit, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, bearing two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred bunches of raisins, a hundred of summer fruits, and a skin of wine. 
2SA.16.2	And the king said to Ziba, “Why have you brought these?” Ziba answered, “The asses are for the king's household to ride on, the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine for those who faint in the wilderness to drink.” 
2SA.16.3	And the king said, “And where is your master's son?” Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he remains in Jerusalem; for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel will give me back the kingdom of my father.’ ” 
2SA.16.4	Then the king said to Ziba, “Behold, all that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours.” And Ziba said, “I do obeisance; let me ever find favor in your sight, my lord the king.”
2SA.16.5	When King David came to Bahurim, there came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shime-i, the son of Gera; and as he came he cursed continually. 
2SA.16.6	And he threw stones at David, and at all the servants of King David; and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. 
2SA.16.7	And Shime-i said as he cursed, “Begone, begone, you man of blood, you worthless fellow! 
2SA.16.8	The 
2SA.16.9	Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and take off his head.” 
2SA.16.10	But the king said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the 
2SA.16.11	And David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “Behold, my own son seeks my life; how much more now may this Benjaminite! Let him alone, and let him curse; for the 
2SA.16.12	It may be that the 
2SA.16.13	So David and his men went on the road, while Shime-i went along on the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him and flung dust. 
2SA.16.14	And the king, and all the people who were with him, arrived weary at the Jordan;
2SA.16.15	Now Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. 
2SA.16.16	And when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, “Long live the king! Long live the king!” 
2SA.16.17	And Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?” 
2SA.16.18	And Hushai said to Absalom, “No; for whom the 
2SA.16.19	And again, whom should I serve? Should it not be his son? As I have served your father, so I will serve you.”
2SA.16.20	Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give your counsel; what shall we do?” 
2SA.16.21	Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go in to your father's concubines, whom he has left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that you have made yourself odious to your father, and the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened.” 
2SA.16.22	So they pitched a tent for Absalom upon the roof; and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel. 
2SA.16.23	Now in those days the counsel which Ahithophel gave was as if one consulted the oracle
2SA.17.1	Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Let me choose twelve thousand men, and I will set out and pursue David tonight. 
2SA.17.2	I will come upon him while he is weary and discouraged, and throw him into a panic; and all the people who are with him will flee. I will strike down the king only, 
2SA.17.3	and I will bring all the people back to you as a bride comes home to her husband. You seek the life of only one man,
2SA.17.4	And the advice pleased Absalom and all the elders of Israel.
2SA.17.5	Then Absalom said, “Call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he has to say.” 
2SA.17.6	And when Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom said to him, “Thus has Ahithophel spoken; shall we do as he advises? If not, you speak.” 
2SA.17.7	Then Hushai said to Absalom, “This time the counsel which Ahithophel has given is not good.” 
2SA.17.8	Hushai said moreover, “You know that your father and his men are mighty men, and that they are enraged, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. Besides, your father is expert in war; he will not spend the night with the people. 
2SA.17.9	Behold, even now he has hidden himself in one of the pits, or in some other place. And when some of the people fall
2SA.17.10	Then even the valiant man, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will utterly melt with fear; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and that those who are with him are valiant men. 
2SA.17.11	But my counsel is that all Israel be gathered to you, from Dan to Beer-sheba, as the sand by the sea for multitude, and that you go to battle in person. 
2SA.17.12	So we shall come upon him in some place where he is to be found, and we shall light upon him as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and all the men with him not one will be left. 
2SA.17.13	If he withdraws into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we shall drag it into the valley, until not even a pebble is to be found there.” 
2SA.17.14	And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.” For the 
2SA.17.15	Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, “Thus and so did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and so have I counseled. 
2SA.17.16	Now therefore send quickly and tell David, ‘Do not lodge tonight at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king and all the people who are with him be swallowed up.’ ” 
2SA.17.17	Now Jonathan and Ahima-az were waiting at En-rogel; a maidservant used to go and tell them, and they would go and tell King David; for they must not be seen entering the city. 
2SA.17.18	But a lad saw them, and told Absalom; so both of them went away quickly, and came to the house of a man at Bahurim, who had a well in his courtyard; and they went down into it. 
2SA.17.19	And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and scattered grain upon it; and nothing was known of it. 
2SA.17.20	When Absalom's servants came to the woman at the house, they said, “Where are Ahima-az and Jonathan?” And the woman said to them, “They have gone over the brook
2SA.17.21	After they had gone, the men came up out of the well, and went and told King David. They said to David, “Arise, and go quickly over the water; for thus and so has Ahithophel counseled against you.” 
2SA.17.22	Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they crossed the Jordan; by daybreak not one was left who had not crossed the Jordan.
2SA.17.23	When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and went off home to his own city. And he set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the tomb of his father.
2SA.17.24	Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel. 
2SA.17.25	Now Absalom had set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra the Ishmaelite,
2SA.17.26	And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.
2SA.17.27	When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, and Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim, 
2SA.17.28	brought beds, basins, and earthen vessels, wheat, barley, meal, parched grain, beans and lentils,
2SA.17.29	honey and curds and sheep and cheese from the herd, for David and the people with him to eat; for they said, “The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness.”
2SA.18.1	Then David mustered the men who were with him, and set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds. 
2SA.18.2	And David sent forth the army, one third under the command of Joab, one third under the command of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and one third under the command of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the men, “I myself will also go out with you.” 
2SA.18.3	But the men said, “You shall not go out. For if we flee, they will not care about us. If half of us die, they will not care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us;
2SA.18.4	The king said to them, “Whatever seems best to you I will do.” So the king stood at the side of the gate, while all the army marched out by hundreds and by thousands. 
2SA.18.5	And the king ordered Joab and Abishai and Ittai, “Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom.” And all the people heard when the king gave orders to all the commanders about Absalom.
2SA.18.6	So the army went out into the field against Israel; and the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim. 
2SA.18.7	And the men of Israel were defeated there by the servants of David, and the slaughter there was great on that day, twenty thousand men. 
2SA.18.8	The battle spread over the face of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword.
2SA.18.9	And Absalom chanced to meet the servants of David. Absalom was riding upon his mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a great oak, and his head caught fast in the oak, and he was left hanging
2SA.18.10	And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, “Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.” 
2SA.18.11	Joab said to the man who told him, “What, you saw him! Why then did you not strike him there to the ground? I would have been glad to give you ten pieces of silver and a girdle.” 
2SA.18.12	But the man said to Joab, “Even if I felt in my hand the weight of a thousand pieces of silver, I would not put forth my hand against the king's son; for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, ‘For my sake protect the young man Absalom.’ 
2SA.18.13	On the other hand, if I had dealt treacherously against his life
2SA.18.14	Joab said, “I will not waste time like this with you.” And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them into the heart of Absalom, while he was still alive in the oak. 
2SA.18.15	And ten young men, Joab's armor-bearers, surrounded Absalom and struck him, and killed him.
2SA.18.16	Then Joab blew the trumpet, and the troops came back from pursuing Israel; for Joab restrained them. 
2SA.18.17	And they took Absalom, and threw him into a great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones; and all Israel fled every one to his own home. 
2SA.18.18	Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself the pillar which is in the King's Valley, for he said, “I have no son to keep my name in remembrance”; he called the pillar after his own name, and it is called Absalom's monument to this day.
2SA.18.19	Then said Ahima-az the son of Zadok, “Let me run, and carry tidings to the king that the 
2SA.18.20	And Joab said to him, “You are not to carry tidings today; you may carry tidings another day, but today you shall carry no tidings, because the king's son is dead.” 
2SA.18.21	Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen.” The Cushite bowed before Joab, and ran. 
2SA.18.22	Then Ahima-az the son of Zadok said again to Joab, “Come what may, let me also run after the Cushite.” And Joab said, “Why will you run, my son, seeing that you will have no reward for the tidings?” 
2SA.18.23	“Come what may,” he said, “I will run.” So he said to him, “Run.” Then Ahima-az ran by the way of the plain, and outran the Cushite.
2SA.18.24	Now David was sitting between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the wall, and when he lifted up his eyes and looked, he saw a man running alone. 
2SA.18.25	And the watchman called out and told the king. And the king said, “If he is alone, there are tidings in his mouth.” And he came apace, and drew near. 
2SA.18.26	And the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called to the gate and said, “See, another man running alone!” The king said, “He also brings tidings.” 
2SA.18.27	And the watchman said, “I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahima-az the son of Zadok.” And the king said, “He is a good man, and comes with good tidings.”
2SA.18.28	Then Ahima-az cried out to the king, “All is well.” And he bowed before the king with his face to the earth, and said, “Blessed be the 
2SA.18.29	And the king said, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” Ahima-az answered, “When Joab sent your servant,
2SA.18.30	And the king said, “Turn aside, and stand here.” So he turned aside, and stood still.
2SA.18.31	And behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, “Good tidings for my lord the king! For the 
2SA.18.32	The king said to the Cushite, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” And the Cushite answered, “May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against you for evil, be like that young man.” 
2SA.18.33	 And the king was deeply moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept; and as he went, he said, “O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!”
2SA.19.1	It was told Joab, “Behold, the king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.” 
2SA.19.2	So the victory that day was turned into mourning for all the people; for the people heard that day, “The king is grieving for his son.” 
2SA.19.3	And the people stole into the city that day as people steal in who are ashamed when they flee in battle. 
2SA.19.4	The king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, “O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!” 
2SA.19.5	Then Joab came into the house to the king, and said, “You have today covered with shame the faces of all your servants, who have this day saved your life, and the lives of your sons and your daughters, and the lives of your wives and your concubines, 
2SA.19.6	because you love those who hate you and hate those who love you. For you have made it clear today that commanders and servants are nothing to you; for today I perceive that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead today, then you would be pleased. 
2SA.19.7	Now therefore arise, go out and speak kindly to your servants; for I swear by the 
2SA.19.8	Then the king arose, and took his seat in the gate. And the people were all told, “Behold, the king is sitting in the gate”; and all the people came before the king.
2SA.19.8	Now Israel had fled every man to his own home. 
2SA.19.9	And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies, and saved us from the hand of the Philistines; and now he has fled out of the land from Absalom. 
2SA.19.10	But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?”
2SA.19.11	And King David sent this message to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, “Say to the elders of Judah, ‘Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his house, when the word of all Israel has come to the king?
2SA.19.12	You are my kinsmen, you are my bone and my flesh; why then should you be the last to bring back the king?’ 
2SA.19.13	And say to Amasa, ‘Are you not my bone and my flesh? God do so to me and more also, if you are not commander of my army henceforth in place of Joab.’ ” 
2SA.19.14	And he swayed the heart of all the men of Judah as one man; so that they sent word to the king, “Return, both you and all your servants.” 
2SA.19.15	So the king came back to the Jordan; and Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king and to bring the king over the Jordan.
2SA.19.16	And Shime-i the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, from Bahurim, made haste to come down with the men of Judah to meet King David; 
2SA.19.17	and with him were a thousand men from Benjamin. And Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, with his fifteen sons and his twenty servants, rushed down to the Jordan before the king, 
2SA.19.18	and they crossed the ford
2SA.19.19	and said to the king, “Let not my lord hold me guilty or remember how your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem; let not the king bear it in mind. 
2SA.19.20	For your servant knows that I have sinned; therefore, behold, I have come this day, the first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king.” 
2SA.19.21	Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered, “Shall not Shime-i be put to death for this, because he cursed the 
2SA.19.22	But David said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should this day be as an adversary to me? Shall any one be put to death in Israel this day? For do I not know that I am this day king over Israel?” 
2SA.19.23	And the king said to Shime-i, “You shall not die.” And the king gave him his oath.
2SA.19.24	And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came back in safety. 
2SA.19.25	And when he came from
2SA.19.26	He answered, “My lord, O king, my servant deceived me; for your servant said to him, ‘Saddle an ass for me,
2SA.19.27	He has slandered your servant to my lord the king. But my lord the king is like the angel of God; do therefore what seems good to you. 
2SA.19.28	For all my father's house were but men doomed to death before my lord the king; but you set your servant among those who eat at your table. What further right have I, then, to cry to the king?” 
2SA.19.29	And the king said to him, “Why speak any more of your affairs? I have decided: you and Ziba shall divide the land.” 
2SA.19.30	And Mephibosheth said to the king, “Oh, let him take it all, since my lord the king has come safely home.”
2SA.19.31	Now Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim; and he went on with the king to the Jordan, to escort him over the Jordan. 
2SA.19.32	Barzillai was a very aged man, eighty years old; and he had provided the king with food while he stayed at Mahanaim; for he was a very wealthy man. 
2SA.19.33	And the king said to Barzillai, “Come over with me, and I will provide for you with me in Jerusalem.” 
2SA.19.34	But Barzillai said to the king, “How many years have I still to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem? 
2SA.19.35	I am this day eighty years old; can I discern what is pleasant and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats or what he drinks? Can I still listen to the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king? 
2SA.19.36	Your servant will go a little way over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king recompense me with such a reward? 
2SA.19.37	Pray let your servant return, that I may die in my own city, near the grave of my father and my mother. But here is your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do for him whatever seems good to you.” 
2SA.19.38	And the king answered, “Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do for him whatever seems good to you; and all that you desire of me I will do for you.” 
2SA.19.39	Then all the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over; and the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his own home. 
2SA.19.40	The king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him; all the people of Judah, and also half the people of Israel, brought the king on his way.
2SA.19.41	Then all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, “Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen you away, and brought the king and his household over the Jordan, and all David's men with him?” 
2SA.19.42	All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “Because the king is near of kin to us. Why then are you angry over this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king's expense? Or has he given us any gift?” 
2SA.19.43	And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, “We have ten shares in the king, and in David also we have more than you. Why then did you despise us? Were we not the first to speak of bringing back our king?” But the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.
2SA.20.1	Now there happened to be there a worthless fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite; and he blew the trumpet, and said,
2SA.20.1	“We have no portion in David,
2SA.20.1	and we have no inheritance in the son of Jesse;
2SA.20.1	every man to his tents, O Israel!”
2SA.20.2	So all the men of Israel withdrew from David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah followed their king steadfastly from the Jordan to Jerusalem.
2SA.20.3	And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten concubines whom he had left to care for the house, and put them in a house under guard, and provided for them, but did not go in to them. So they were shut up until the day of their death, living as if in widowhood.
2SA.20.4	Then the king said to Amasa, “Call the men of Judah together to me within three days, and be here yourself.” 
2SA.20.5	So Amasa went to summon Judah; but he delayed beyond the set time which had been appointed him. 
2SA.20.6	And David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom; take your lord's servants and pursue him, lest he get himself fortified cities, and cause us trouble.”
2SA.20.7	And there went out after Abishai, Joab
2SA.20.8	When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Now Joab was wearing a soldier's garment, and over it was a girdle with a sword in its sheath fastened upon his loins, and as he went forward it fell out. 
2SA.20.9	And Joab said to Amasa, “Is it well with you, my brother?” And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him. 
2SA.20.10	But Amasa did not observe the sword which was in Joab's hand; so Joab struck him with it in the body, and shed his bowels to the ground, without striking a second blow; and he died.
2SA.20.10	Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri. 
2SA.20.11	And one of Joab's men took his stand by Amasa, and said, “Whoever favors Joab, and whoever is for David, let him follow Joab.” 
2SA.20.12	And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the highway. And any one who came by, seeing him, stopped;
2SA.20.13	When he was taken out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.
2SA.20.14	And Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel of Beth-maacah;
2SA.20.15	And all the men who were with Joab came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah; they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart; and they were battering the wall, to throw it down. 
2SA.20.16	Then a wise woman called from the city, “Hear! Hear! Tell Joab, ‘Come here, that I may speak to you.’ ” 
2SA.20.17	And he came near her; and the woman said, “Are you Joab?” He answered, “I am.” Then she said to him, “Listen to the words of your maidservant.” And he answered, “I am listening.” 
2SA.20.18	Then she said, “They were wont to say in old time, ‘Let them but ask counsel at Abel’; and so they settled a matter. 
2SA.20.19	I am one of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel; you seek to destroy a city which is a mother in Israel; why will you swallow up the heritage of the 
2SA.20.20	Joab answered, “Far be it from me, far be it, that I should swallow up or destroy! 
2SA.20.21	That is not true. But a man of the hill country of Ephraim, called Sheba the son of Bichri, has lifted up his hand against King David; give up him alone, and I will withdraw from the city.” And the woman said to Joab, “Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall.” 
2SA.20.22	Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. So he blew the trumpet, and they dispersed from the city, every man to his home. And Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
2SA.20.24	and Adoram was in charge of the forced labor; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder; 
2SA.20.25	and Sheva was secretary; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests; 
2SA.20.26	and Ira the Jairite was also David's priest.
2SA.21.1	Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year; and David sought the face of the 
2SA.21.2	So the king called the Gibeonites.
2SA.21.3	And David said to the Gibeonites, “What shall I do for you? And how shall I make expiation, that you may bless the heritage of the 
2SA.21.4	The Gibeonites said to him, “It is not a matter of silver or gold between us and Saul or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel.” And he said, “What do you say that I shall do for you?” 
2SA.21.5	They said to the king, “The man who consumed us and planned to destroy us, so that we should have no place in all the territory of Israel, 
2SA.21.6	let seven of his sons be given to us, so that we may hang them up before the 
2SA.21.7	But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Saul's son Jonathan, because of the oath of the 
2SA.21.8	The king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Merab
2SA.21.9	and he gave them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the mountain before the 
2SA.21.10	Then Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until rain fell upon them from the heavens; and she did not allow the birds of the air to come upon them by day, or the beasts of the field by night. 
2SA.21.11	When David was told what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done, 
2SA.21.12	David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the public square of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, on the day the Philistines killed Saul on Gilboa; 
2SA.21.13	and he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan; and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged. 
2SA.21.14	And they buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the land of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father; and they did all that the king commanded. And after that God heeded supplications for the land.
2SA.21.15	The Philistines had war again with Israel, and David went down together with his servants, and they fought against the Philistines; and David grew weary. 
2SA.21.16	And Ishbi-benob, one of the descendants of the giants, whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of bronze, and who was girded with a new sword, thought to kill David. 
2SA.21.17	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to his aid, and attacked the Philistine and killed him. Then David's men adjured him, “You shall no more go out with us to battle, lest you quench the lamp of Israel.”
2SA.21.19	And there was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, the Bethlehemite, slew Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. 
2SA.21.20	And there was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on each hand, and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number; and he also was descended from the giants. 
2SA.21.21	And when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shime-i, David's brother, slew him. 
2SA.21.22	These four were descended from the giants in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.
2SA.22.1	And David spoke to the 
2SA.22.2	 He said,
2SA.22.2	“The 
2SA.22.3	my
2SA.22.3	my shield and the horn of my salvation,
2SA.22.3	my stronghold and my refuge,
2SA.22.3	my savior; thou savest me from violence.
2SA.22.4	I call upon the 
2SA.22.4	and I am saved from my enemies.
2SA.22.5	“For the waves of death encompassed me,
2SA.22.5	the torrents of perdition assailed me;
2SA.22.6	the cords of Sheol entangled me,
2SA.22.6	the snares of death confronted me.
2SA.22.7	“In my distress I called upon the 
2SA.22.7	to my God I called.
2SA.22.7	From his temple he heard my voice,
2SA.22.7	and my cry came to his ears.
2SA.22.8	“Then the earth reeled and rocked;
2SA.22.8	the foundations of the heavens trembled
2SA.22.8	and quaked, because he was angry.
2SA.22.9	Smoke went up from his nostrils,
2SA.22.9	and devouring fire from his mouth;
2SA.22.9	glowing coals flamed forth from him.
2SA.22.10	He bowed the heavens, and came down;
2SA.22.10	thick darkness was under his feet.
2SA.22.11	He rode on a cherub, and flew;
2SA.22.11	he was seen upon the wings of the wind.
2SA.22.12	He made darkness around him
2SA.22.12	his canopy, thick clouds, a gathering of water.
2SA.22.13	Out of the brightness before him
2SA.22.13	coals of fire flamed forth.
2SA.22.14	The 
2SA.22.14	and the Most High uttered his voice.
2SA.22.15	And he sent out arrows, and scattered them;
2SA.22.15	lightning, and routed them.
2SA.22.16	Then the channels of the sea were seen,
2SA.22.16	the foundations of the world were laid bare,
2SA.22.16	at the rebuke of the 
2SA.22.16	at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
2SA.22.17	“He reached from on high, he took me,
2SA.22.17	he drew me out of many waters.
2SA.22.18	He delivered me from my strong enemy,
2SA.22.18	from those who hated me;
2SA.22.18	for they were too mighty for me.
2SA.22.19	They came upon me in the day of my calamity;
2SA.22.19	but the 
2SA.22.20	He brought me forth into a broad place;
2SA.22.20	he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
2SA.22.21	“The 
2SA.22.21	according to the cleanness of my hands he recompensed me.
2SA.22.22	For I have kept the ways of the 
2SA.22.22	and have not wickedly departed from my God.
2SA.22.23	For all his ordinances were before me,
2SA.22.23	and from his statutes I did not turn aside.
2SA.22.24	I was blameless before him,
2SA.22.24	and I kept myself from guilt.
2SA.22.25	Therefore the 
2SA.22.25	according to my cleanness in his sight.
2SA.22.26	“With the loyal thou dost show thyself loyal;
2SA.22.26	with the blameless man thou dost show thyself blameless;
2SA.22.27	with the pure thou dost show thyself pure,
2SA.22.27	and with the crooked thou dost show thyself perverse.
2SA.22.28	Thou dost deliver a humble people,
2SA.22.28	but thy eyes are upon the haughty to bring them down.
2SA.22.29	Yea, thou art my lamp, O 
2SA.22.29	and my God lightens my darkness.
2SA.22.30	Yea, by thee I can crush a troop,
2SA.22.30	and by my God I can leap over a wall.
2SA.22.31	This God—his way is perfect;
2SA.22.31	the promise of the 
2SA.22.31	he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him.
2SA.22.32	“For who is God, but the 
2SA.22.32	And who is a rock, except our God?
2SA.22.33	This God is my strong refuge,
2SA.22.33	and has made
2SA.22.34	He made my
2SA.22.34	and set me secure on the heights.
2SA.22.35	He trains my hands for war,
2SA.22.35	so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
2SA.22.36	Thou hast given me the shield of thy salvation,
2SA.22.36	and thy help
2SA.22.37	Thou didst give a wide place for my steps under me,
2SA.22.37	and my feet
2SA.22.38	I pursued my enemies and destroyed them,
2SA.22.38	and did not turn back until they were consumed.
2SA.22.39	I consumed them; I thrust them through, so that they did not rise;
2SA.22.39	they fell under my feet.
2SA.22.40	For thou didst gird me with strength for the battle;
2SA.22.40	thou didst make my assailants sink under me.
2SA.22.41	Thou didst make my enemies turn their backs to me,
2SA.22.41	those who hated me, and I destroyed them.
2SA.22.42	They looked, but there was none to save;
2SA.22.42	they cried to the 
2SA.22.43	I beat them fine as the dust of the earth,
2SA.22.43	I crushed them and stamped them down like the mire of the streets.
2SA.22.44	“Thou didst deliver me from strife with the peoples;
2SA.22.44	thou didst keep me as the head of the nations;
2SA.22.44	people whom I had not known served me.
2SA.22.45	Foreigners came cringing to me;
2SA.22.45	as soon as they heard of me, they obeyed me.
2SA.22.46	Foreigners lost heart,
2SA.22.46	and came trembling
2SA.22.47	“The 
2SA.22.47	and exalted be my God, the rock of my salvation,
2SA.22.48	the God who gave me vengeance
2SA.22.48	and brought down peoples under me,
2SA.22.49	who brought me out from my enemies;
2SA.22.49	thou didst exalt me above my adversaries,
2SA.22.49	thou didst deliver me from men of violence.
2SA.22.50	and sing praises to thy name.
2SA.22.51	Great triumphs he gives
2SA.22.51	and shows steadfast love to his anointed,
2SA.22.51	to David, and his descendants for ever.”
2SA.23.1	Now these are the last words of David:
2SA.23.1	The oracle of David, the son of Jesse,
2SA.23.1	the oracle of the man who was raised on high,
2SA.23.1	the anointed of the God of Jacob,
2SA.23.1	the sweet psalmist of Israel:
2SA.23.2	“The Spirit of the 
2SA.23.2	his word is upon my tongue.
2SA.23.3	The God of Israel has spoken,
2SA.23.3	the Rock of Israel has said to me:
2SA.23.3	When one rules justly over men,
2SA.23.3	ruling in the fear of God,
2SA.23.4	he dawns on them like the morning light,
2SA.23.4	like the sun shining forth upon a cloudless morning,
2SA.23.4	like rain
2SA.23.5	Yea, does not my house stand so with God?
2SA.23.5	For he has made with me an everlasting covenant,
2SA.23.5	ordered in all things and secure.
2SA.23.5	For will he not cause to prosper
2SA.23.5	all my help and my desire?
2SA.23.6	But godless men
2SA.23.6	for they cannot be taken with the hand;
2SA.23.7	but the man who touches them
2SA.23.7	arms himself with iron and the shaft of a spear,
2SA.23.7	and they are utterly consumed with fire.”
2SA.23.9	And next to him among the three mighty men was Eleazar the son of Dodo, son of Ahohi. He was with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle, and the men of Israel withdrew. 
2SA.23.10	He rose and struck down the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand cleaved to the sword; and the 
2SA.23.11	And next to him was Shammah, the son of Agee the Hararite. The Philistines gathered together at Lehi, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the men fled from the Philistines. 
2SA.23.12	But he took his stand in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and the 
2SA.23.13	And three of the thirty chief men went down, and came about harvest time to David at the cave of Adullam, when a band of Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.23.14	David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem. 
2SA.23.15	And David said longingly, “O that some one would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate!” 
2SA.23.16	Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem which was by the gate, and took and brought it to David. But he would not drink of it; he poured it out to the 
2SA.23.17	and said, “Far be it from me, O 
2SA.23.18	Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the thirty.
2SA.23.19	He was the most renowned of the thirty,
2SA.23.20	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a valiant man
2SA.23.21	And he slew an Egyptian, a handsome man. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but Benaiah went down to him with a staff, and snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. 
2SA.23.22	These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and won a name beside the three mighty men. 
2SA.23.23	He was renowned among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David set him over his bodyguard.
2SA.23.24	Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, 
2SA.23.25	Shammah of Harod, Elika of Harod, 
2SA.23.26	Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh of Tekoa, 
2SA.23.27	Abiezer, of Anathoth, Mebunnai the Hushathite, 
2SA.23.28	Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai of Netophah, 
2SA.23.29	Heleb the son of Baanah of Netophah, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibe-ah of the Benjaminites, 
2SA.23.30	Benaiah of Pirathon, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash, 
2SA.23.31	Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth of Bahurim, 
2SA.23.32	Eliahba of Sha-albon, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan, 
2SA.23.33	Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite, 
2SA.23.34	Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai of Maacah, Eliam the son of Ahithophel of Gilo, 
2SA.23.35	Hezro
2SA.23.36	Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite, 
2SA.23.37	Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai of Be-eroth, the armor-bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah, 
2SA.23.38	Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 
2SA.23.39	Uriah the Hittite: thirty-seven in all.
2SA.24.2	So the king said to Joab and the commanders of the army,
2SA.24.3	But Joab said to the king, “May the 
2SA.24.4	But the king's word prevailed against Joab and the commanders of the army. So Joab and the commanders of the army went out from the presence of the king to number the people of Israel. 
2SA.24.5	They crossed the Jordan, and began from Aroer,
2SA.24.6	Then they came to Gilead, and to Kadesh in the land of the Hittites;
2SA.24.7	and came to the fortress of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites; and they went out to the Negeb of Judah at Beer-sheba. 
2SA.24.8	So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. 
2SA.24.9	And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to the king: in Israel there were eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand.
2SA.24.10	But David's heart smote him after he had numbered the people. And David said to the 
2SA.24.11	And when David arose in the morning, the word of the 
2SA.24.12	“Go and say to David, ‘Thus says the 
2SA.24.13	So Gad came to David and told him, and said to him, “Shall three
2SA.24.14	Then David said to Gad, “I am in great distress; let us fall into the hand of the 
2SA.24.15	So the 
2SA.24.16	And when the angel stretched forth his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the 
2SA.24.17	Then David spoke to the 
2SA.24.18	And Gad came that day to David, and said to him, “Go up, rear an altar to the 
2SA.24.19	So David went up at Gad's word, as the 
2SA.24.20	And when Araunah looked down, he saw the king and his servants coming on toward him; and Araunah went forth, and did obeisance to the king with his face to the ground. 
2SA.24.21	And Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” David said, “To buy the threshing floor of you, in order to build an altar to the 
2SA.24.22	Then Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him; here are the oxen for the burnt offering, and the threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood. 
2SA.24.23	All this, O king, Araunah gives to the king.” And Araunah said to the king, “The 
2SA.24.24	But the king said to Araunah, “No, but I will buy it of you for a price; I will not offer burnt offerings to the 
2SA.24.25	And David built there an altar to the 
1KI.1.1	Now King David was old and advanced in years; and although they covered him with clothes, he could not get warm. 
1KI.1.2	Therefore his servants said to him, “Let a young maiden be sought for my lord the king, and let her wait upon the king, and be his nurse; let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may be warm.” 
1KI.1.3	So they sought for a beautiful maiden throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. 
1KI.1.4	The maiden was very beautiful; and she became the king's nurse and ministered to him; but the king knew her not.
1KI.1.5	Now Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, “I will be king”; and he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. 
1KI.1.6	His father had never at any time displeased him by asking, “Why have you done thus and so?” He was also a very handsome man; and he was born next after Absalom. 
1KI.1.7	He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest; and they followed Adonijah and helped him. 
1KI.1.8	But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shime-i, and Rei, and David's mighty men were not with Adonijah.
1KI.1.9	Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fatlings by the Serpent's Stone, which is beside En-rogel, and he invited all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the royal officials of Judah, 
1KI.1.10	but he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the mighty men or Solomon his brother.
1KI.1.11	Then Nathan said to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, “Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king and David our lord does not know it? 
1KI.1.12	Now therefore come, let me give you counsel, that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon. 
1KI.1.13	Go in at once to King David, and say to him, ‘Did you not, my lord the king, swear to your maidservant, saying, “Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne”? Why then is Adonijah king?’ 
1KI.1.14	Then while you are still speaking with the king, I also will come in after you and confirm your words.”
1KI.1.15	So Bathsheba went to the king into his chamber (now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king). 
1KI.1.16	Bathsheba bowed and did obeisance to the king, and the king said, “What do you desire?” 
1KI.1.17	She said to him, “My lord, you swore to your maidservant by the 
1KI.1.18	And now, behold, Adonijah is king, although you, my lord the king, do not know it. 
1KI.1.19	He has sacrificed oxen, fatlings, and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army; but Solomon your servant he has not invited. 
1KI.1.20	And now, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you, to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. 
1KI.1.21	Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king sleeps with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be counted offenders.”
1KI.1.22	While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in. 
1KI.1.23	And they told the king, “Here is Nathan the prophet.” And when he came in before the king, he bowed before the king, with his face to the ground. 
1KI.1.24	And Nathan said, “My lord the king, have you said, ‘Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne’? 
1KI.1.25	For he has gone down this day, and has sacrificed oxen, fatlings, and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king's sons, Joab the commander
1KI.1.26	But me, your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon, he has not invited. 
1KI.1.27	Has this thing been brought about by my lord the king and you have not told your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?”
1KI.1.28	Then King David answered, “Call Bathsheba to me.” So she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king. 
1KI.1.29	And the king swore, saying, “As the 
1KI.1.30	as I swore to you by the 
1KI.1.31	Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground, and did obeisance to the king, and said, “May my lord King David live for ever!”
1KI.1.32	King David said, “Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.” So they came before the king. 
1KI.1.33	And the king said to them, “Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon; 
1KI.1.34	and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet there anoint him king over Israel; then blow the trumpet, and say, ‘Long live King Solomon!’ 
1KI.1.35	You shall then come up after him, and he shall come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead; and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.” 
1KI.1.36	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, “Amen! May the 
1KI.1.37	As the 
1KI.1.38	So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down and caused Solomon to ride on King David's mule, and brought him to Gihon. 
1KI.1.39	There Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tent, and anointed Solomon. Then they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, “Long live King Solomon!” 
1KI.1.40	And all the people went up after him, playing on pipes, and rejoicing with great joy, so that the earth was split by their noise.
1KI.1.41	Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they finished feasting. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, “What does this uproar in the city mean?” 
1KI.1.42	While he was still speaking, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said, “Come in, for you are a worthy man and bring good news.” 
1KI.1.43	Jonathan answered Adonijah, “No, for our lord King David has made Solomon king; 
1KI.1.44	and the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride on the king's mule; 
1KI.1.45	and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon; and they have gone up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise that you have heard. 
1KI.1.46	Solomon sits upon the royal throne. 
1KI.1.47	Moreover the king's servants came to congratulate our lord King David, saying, ‘Your God make the name of Solomon more famous than yours, and make his throne greater than your throne.’ And the king bowed himself upon the bed. 
1KI.1.48	And the king also said, ‘Blessed be the 
1KI.1.49	Then all the guests of Adonijah trembled, and rose, and each went his own way. 
1KI.1.50	And Adonijah feared Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold of the horns of the altar. 
1KI.1.51	And it was told Solomon, “Behold, Adonijah fears King Solomon; for lo, he has laid hold of the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solomon swear to me first that he will not slay his servant with the sword.’ ” 
1KI.1.52	And Solomon said, “If he prove to be a worthy man, not one of his hairs shall fall to the earth; but if wickedness is found in him, he shall die.” 
1KI.1.53	So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and did obeisance to King Solomon; and Solomon said to him, “Go to your house.”
1KI.2.1	When David's time to die drew near, he charged Solomon his son, saying, 
1KI.2.2	“I am about to go the way of all the earth. Be strong, and show yourself a man, 
1KI.2.3	and keep the charge of the 
1KI.2.4	that the 
1KI.2.5	“Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, how he dealt with the two commanders of the armies of Israel, Abner the son of Ner, and Amasa the son of Jether, whom he murdered, avenging
1KI.2.6	Act therefore according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace. 
1KI.2.7	But deal loyally with the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table, for with such loyalty they met me when I fled from Absalom your brother. 
1KI.2.8	And there is also with you Shime-i the son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse on the day when I went to Mahanaim; but when he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the 
1KI.2.9	Now therefore hold him not guiltless, for you are a wise man; you will know what you ought to do to him, and you shall bring his gray head down with blood to Sheol.”
1KI.2.10	Then David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. 
1KI.2.11	And the time that David reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. 
1KI.2.12	 So Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was firmly established.
1KI.2.13	Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, “Do you come peaceably?” He said, “Peaceably.” 
1KI.2.14	Then he said, “I have something to say to you.” She said, “Say on.” 
1KI.2.15	He said, “You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel fully expected me to reign; however the kingdom has turned about and become my brother's, for it was his from the 
1KI.2.16	And now I have one request to make of you; do not refuse me.” She said to him, “Say on.” 
1KI.2.17	And he said, “Pray ask King Solomon—he will not refuse you—to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife.” 
1KI.2.18	Bathsheba said, “Very well; I will speak for you to the king.”
1KI.2.19	So Bathsheba went to King Solomon, to speak to him on behalf of Adonijah. And the king rose to meet her, and bowed down to her; then he sat on his throne, and had a seat brought for the king's mother; and she sat on his right. 
1KI.2.20	Then she said, “I have one small request to make of you; do not refuse me.” And the king said to her, “Make your request, my mother; for I will not refuse you.” 
1KI.2.21	She said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as his wife.” 
1KI.2.22	King Solomon answered his mother, “And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother, and on his side are Abiathar
1KI.2.23	Then King Solomon swore by the 
1KI.2.24	Now therefore as the 
1KI.2.25	So King Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he struck him down, and he died.
1KI.2.26	And to Abiathar the priest the king said, “Go to Anathoth, to your estate; for you deserve death. But I will not at this time put you to death, because you bore the ark of the Lord 
1KI.2.27	So Solomon expelled Abiathar from being priest to the 
1KI.2.28	When the news came to Joab—for Joab had supported Adonijah although he had not supported Absalom—Joab fled to the tent of the 
1KI.2.29	And when it was told King Solomon, “Joab has fled to the tent of the 
1KI.2.30	So Benaiah came to the tent of the 
1KI.2.31	The king replied to him, “Do as he has said, strike him down and bury him; and thus take away from me and from my father's house the guilt for the blood which Joab shed without cause. 
1KI.2.32	The 
1KI.2.33	So shall their blood come back upon the head of Joab and upon the head of his descendants for ever; but to David, and to his descendants, and to his house, and to his throne, there shall be peace from the 
1KI.2.34	Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and struck him down and killed him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. 
1KI.2.35	The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada over the army in place of Joab, and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.
1KI.2.36	Then the king sent and summoned Shime-i, and said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and do not go forth from there to any place whatever. 
1KI.2.37	For on the day you go forth, and cross the brook Kidron, know for certain that you shall die; your blood shall be upon your own head.” 
1KI.2.38	And Shime-i said to the king, “What you say is good; as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do.” So Shime-i dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
1KI.2.39	But it happened at the end of three years that two of Shime-i's slaves ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And when it was told Shime-i, “Behold, your slaves are in Gath,” 
1KI.2.40	Shime-i arose and saddled an ass, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his slaves; Shime-i went and brought his slaves from Gath. 
1KI.2.41	And when Solomon was told that Shime-i had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and returned, 
1KI.2.42	the king sent and summoned Shime-i, and said to him, “Did I not make you swear by the 
1KI.2.43	Why then have you not kept your oath to the 
1KI.2.44	The king also said to Shime-i, “You know in your own heart all the evil that you did to David my father; so the 
1KI.2.45	But King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the 
1KI.2.46	Then the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out and struck him down, and he died.
1KI.2.46	So the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
1KI.3.1	Solomon made a marriage alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt; he took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had finished building his own house and the house of the 
1KI.3.2	The people were sacrificing at the high places, however, because no house had yet been built for the name of the 
1KI.3.3	Solomon loved the 
1KI.3.4	 And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place; Solomon used to offer a thousand burnt offerings upon that altar. 
1KI.3.5	At Gibeon the 
1KI.3.6	And Solomon said, “Thou hast shown great and steadfast love to thy servant David my father, because he walked before thee in faithfulness, in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart toward thee; and thou hast kept for him this great and steadfast love, and hast given him a son to sit on his throne this day. 
1KI.3.7	And now, O 
1KI.3.8	And thy servant is in the midst of thy people whom thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered or counted for multitude. 
1KI.3.9	Give thy servant therefore an understanding mind to govern thy people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to govern this thy great people?”
1KI.3.10	It pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this. 
1KI.3.11	And God said to him, “Because you have asked this, and have not asked for yourself long life or riches or the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern what is right, 
1KI.3.12	behold, I now do according to your word. Behold, I give you a wise and discerning mind, so that none like you has been before you and none like you shall arise after you. 
1KI.3.13	I give you also what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that no other king shall compare with you, all your days. 
1KI.3.14	And if you will walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and my commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days.”
1KI.3.15	And Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream. Then he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the 
1KI.3.16	Then two harlots came to the king, and stood before him. 
1KI.3.17	The one woman said, “Oh, my lord, this woman and I dwell in the same house; and I gave birth to a child while she was in the house. 
1KI.3.18	Then on the third day after I was delivered, this woman also gave birth; and we were alone; there was no one else with us in the house, only we two were in the house. 
1KI.3.19	And this woman's son died in the night, because she lay on it. 
1KI.3.20	And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while your maidservant slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead son in my bosom. 
1KI.3.21	When I rose in the morning to nurse my child, behold, it was dead; but when I looked at it closely in the morning, behold, it was not the child that I had borne.” 
1KI.3.22	But the other woman said, “No, the living child is mine, and the dead child is yours.” The first said, “No, the dead child is yours, and the living child is mine.” Thus they spoke before the king.
1KI.3.23	Then the king said, “The one says, ‘This is my son that is alive, and your son is dead’; and the other says, ‘No; but your son is dead, and my son is the living one.’ ” 
1KI.3.24	And the king said, “Bring me a sword.” So a sword was brought before the king. 
1KI.3.25	And the king said, “Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.” 
1KI.3.26	Then the woman whose son was alive said to the king, because her heart yearned for her son, “Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and by no means slay it.” But the other said, “It shall be neither mine nor yours; divide it.” 
1KI.3.27	Then the king answered and said, “Give the living child to the first woman, and by no means slay it; she is its mother.” 
1KI.3.28	And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had rendered; and they stood in awe of the king, because they perceived that the wisdom of God was in him, to render justice.
1KI.4.1	King Solomon was king over all Israel, 
1KI.4.2	and these were his high officials: Azariah the son of Zadok was the priest; 
1KI.4.3	Elihoreph and Ahijah the sons of Shisha were secretaries; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; 
1KI.4.4	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was in command of the army; Zadok and Abiathar were priests; 
1KI.4.5	Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; Zabud the son of Nathan was priest and king's friend; 
1KI.4.6	Ahishar was in charge of the palace; and Adoniram the son of Abda was in charge of the forced labor.
1KI.4.7	Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided food for the king and his household; each man had to make provision for one month in the year. 
1KI.4.8	These were their names: Ben-hur, in the hill country of Ephraim; 
1KI.4.9	Ben-deker, in Makaz, Sha-albim, Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan; 
1KI.4.10	Ben-hesed, in Arubboth (to him belonged Socoh and all the land of Hepher); 
1KI.4.11	Ben-abinadab, in all Naphath-dor (he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon as his wife); 
1KI.4.12	Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach, Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan below Jezreel, and from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as the other side of Jokmeam; 
1KI.4.13	Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead (he had the villages of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead, and he had the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars); 
1KI.4.14	Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim; 
1KI.4.15	Ahima-az, in Naphtali (he had taken Basemath the daughter of Solomon as his wife); 
1KI.4.16	Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth; 
1KI.4.17	Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar; 
1KI.4.18	Shime-i the son of Ela, in Benjamin; 
1KI.4.19	Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan. And there was one officer in the land of Judah.
1KI.4.20	Judah and Israel were as many as the sand by the sea; they ate and drank and were happy. 
1KI.4.21	 Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt; they brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life.
1KI.4.22	Solomon's provision for one day was thirty cors of fine flour, and sixty cors of meal, 
1KI.4.23	ten fat oxen, and twenty pasture-fed cattle, a hundred sheep, besides harts, gazelles, roebucks, and fatted fowl. 
1KI.4.24	For he had dominion over all the region west of the Euphrates from Tiphsah to Gaza, over all the kings west of the Euphrates; and he had peace on all sides round about him. 
1KI.4.25	And Judah and Israel dwelt in safety, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, all the days of Solomon. 
1KI.4.26	Solomon also had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. 
1KI.4.27	And those officers supplied provisions for King Solomon, and for all who came to King Solomon's table, each one in his month; they let nothing be lacking. 
1KI.4.28	Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds they brought to the place where it was required, each according to his charge.
1KI.4.29	And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding beyond measure, and largeness of mind like the sand on the seashore, 
1KI.4.30	so that Solomon's wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt. 
1KI.4.31	For he was wiser than all other men, wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame was in all the nations round about. 
1KI.4.32	He also uttered three thousand proverbs; and his songs were a thousand and five. 
1KI.4.33	He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of the wall; he spoke also of beasts, and of birds, and of reptiles, and of fish. 
1KI.4.34	And men came from all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and from all the kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.
1KI.5.2	 And Solomon sent word to Hiram, 
1KI.5.3	“You know that David my father could not build a house for the name of the 
1KI.5.4	But now the 
1KI.5.5	 And so I purpose to build a house for the name of the 
1KI.5.6	Now therefore command that cedars of Lebanon be cut for me; and my servants will join your servants, and I will pay you for your servants such wages as you set; for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.”
1KI.5.7	When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly, and said, “Blessed be the 
1KI.5.8	And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, “I have heard the message which you have sent to me; I am ready to do all you desire in the matter of cedar and cypress timber. 
1KI.5.9	My servants shall bring it down to the sea from Lebanon; and I will make it into rafts to go by sea to the place you direct, and I will have them broken up there, and you shall receive it; and you shall meet my wishes by providing food for my household.” 
1KI.5.10	So Hiram supplied Solomon with all the timber of cedar and cypress that he desired, 
1KI.5.11	while Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand cors of wheat as food for his household, and twenty thousand
1KI.5.12	And the 
1KI.5.13	King Solomon raised a levy of forced labor out of all Israel; and the levy numbered thirty thousand men. 
1KI.5.14	And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month in relays; they would be a month in Lebanon and two months at home; Adoniram was in charge of the levy. 
1KI.5.15	 Solomon also had seventy thousand burden-bearers and eighty thousand hewers of stone in the hill country, 
1KI.5.16	besides Solomon's three thousand three hundred chief officers who were over the work, who had charge of the people who carried on the work. 
1KI.5.17	At the king's command, they quarried out great, costly stones in order to lay the foundation of the house with dressed stones. 
1KI.5.18	So Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the men of Gebal did the hewing and prepared the timber and the stone to build the house.
1KI.6.2	The house which King Solomon built for the 
1KI.6.3	The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits long, equal to the width of the house, and ten cubits deep in front of the house. 
1KI.6.4	And he made for the house windows with recessed frames. 
1KI.6.5	He also built a structure against the wall of the house, running round the walls of the house, both the nave and the inner sanctuary; and he made side chambers all around. 
1KI.6.6	The lowest story
1KI.6.7	When the house was built, it was with stone prepared at the quarry; so that neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron was heard in the temple, while it was being built.
1KI.6.8	The entrance for the lowest
1KI.6.9	So he built the house, and finished it; and he made the ceiling of the house of beams and planks of cedar. 
1KI.6.10	He built the structure against the whole house, each story
1KI.6.11	Now the word of the 
1KI.6.12	“Concerning this house which you are building, if you will walk in my statutes and obey my ordinances and keep all my commandments and walk in them, then I will establish my word with you, which I spoke to David your father. 
1KI.6.13	And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.”
1KI.6.14	So Solomon built the house, and finished it. 
1KI.6.15	He lined the walls of the house on the inside with boards of cedar; from the floor of the house to the rafters
1KI.6.16	He built twenty cubits of the rear of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the rafters,
1KI.6.17	The house, that is, the nave in front of the inner sanctuary, was forty cubits long. 
1KI.6.18	The cedar within the house was carved in the form of gourds and open flowers; all was cedar, no stone was seen. 
1KI.6.19	The inner sanctuary he prepared in the innermost part of the house, to set there the ark of the covenant of the 
1KI.6.20	The inner sanctuary
1KI.6.21	And Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold, and he drew chains of gold across, in front of the inner sanctuary, and overlaid it with gold. 
1KI.6.22	And he overlaid the whole house with gold, until all the house was finished. Also the whole altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary he overlaid with gold.
1KI.6.23	In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olivewood, each ten cubits high. 
1KI.6.24	Five cubits was the length of one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the length of the other wing of the cherub; it was ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other. 
1KI.6.25	The other cherub also measured ten cubits; both cherubim had the same measure and the same form. 
1KI.6.26	The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and so was that of the other cherub. 
1KI.6.27	He put the cherubim in the innermost part of the house; and the wings of the cherubim were spread out so that a wing of one touched the one wall, and a wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; their other wings touched each other in the middle of the house. 
1KI.6.28	And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.
1KI.6.29	He carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, in the inner and outer rooms. 
1KI.6.30	The floor of the house he overlaid with gold in the inner and outer rooms.
1KI.6.31	For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors of olivewood; the lintel and the doorposts formed a pentagon.
1KI.6.32	He covered the two doors of olivewood with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers; he overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubim and upon the palm trees.
1KI.6.33	So also he made for the entrance to the nave doorposts of olivewood, in the form of a square, 
1KI.6.34	and two doors of cypress wood; the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding. 
1KI.6.35	On them he carved cherubim and palm trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold evenly applied upon the carved work. 
1KI.6.36	He built the inner court with three courses of hewn stone and one course of cedar beams.
1KI.6.37	In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the 
1KI.6.38	And in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished in all its parts, and according to all its specifications. He was seven years in building it.
1KI.7.1	Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished his entire house.
1KI.7.2	He built the House of the Forest of Lebanon; its length was a hundred cubits, and its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits, and it was built upon three
1KI.7.3	And it was covered with cedar above the chambers that were upon the forty-five pillars, fifteen in each row. 
1KI.7.4	There were window frames in three rows, and window opposite window in three tiers. 
1KI.7.5	All the doorways and windows
1KI.7.6	And he made the Hall of Pillars; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits; there was a porch in front with pillars, and a canopy before them.
1KI.7.7	And he made the Hall of the Throne where he was to pronounce judgment, even the Hall of Judgment; it was finished with cedar from floor to rafters.
1KI.7.8	His own house where he was to dwell, in the other court back of the hall, was of like workmanship. Solomon also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh's daughter whom he had taken in marriage.
1KI.7.9	All these were made of costly stones, hewn according to measure, sawed with saws, back and front, even from the foundation to the coping, and from the court of the house of the 
1KI.7.10	The foundation was of costly stones, huge stones, stones of eight and ten cubits. 
1KI.7.11	And above were costly stones, hewn according to measurement, and cedar. 
1KI.7.12	The great court had three courses of hewn stone round about, and a course of cedar beams; so had the inner court of the house of the 
1KI.7.13	And King Solomon sent and brought Hiram from Tyre. 
1KI.7.14	He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in bronze; and he was full of wisdom, understanding, and skill, for making any work in bronze. He came to King Solomon, and did all his work.
1KI.7.16	He also made two capitals of molten bronze, to set upon the tops of the pillars; the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits. 
1KI.7.17	Then he made two
1KI.7.18	Likewise he made pomegranates;
1KI.7.19	Now the capitals that were upon the tops of the pillars in the vestibule were of lily-work, four cubits. 
1KI.7.20	The capitals were upon the two pillars and also above the rounded projection which was beside the network; there were two hundred pomegranates, in two rows round about; and so with the other capital. 
1KI.7.21	He set up the pillars at the vestibule of the temple; he set up the pillar on the south and called its name Jachin; and he set up the pillar on the north and called its name Boaz. 
1KI.7.22	And upon the tops of the pillars was lily-work. Thus the work of the pillars was finished.
1KI.7.24	Under its brim were gourds, for thirty
1KI.7.25	It stood upon twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east; the sea was set upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward. 
1KI.7.26	Its thickness was a handbreadth; and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily; it held two thousand baths.
1KI.7.27	He also made the ten stands of bronze; each stand was four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high. 
1KI.7.28	This was the construction of the stands: they had panels, and the panels were set in the frames 
1KI.7.29	and on the panels that were set in the frames were lions, oxen, and cherubim. Upon the frames, both above and below the lions and oxen, there were wreaths of beveled work. 
1KI.7.30	Moreover each stand had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze; and at the four corners were supports for a laver. The supports were cast, with wreaths at the side of each. 
1KI.7.31	Its opening was within a crown which projected upward one cubit; its opening was round, as a pedestal is made, a cubit and a half deep. At its opening there were carvings; and its panels were square, not round. 
1KI.7.32	And the four wheels were underneath the panels; the axles of the wheels were of one piece with the stands; and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half. 
1KI.7.33	The wheels were made like a chariot wheel; their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs, were all cast. 
1KI.7.34	There were four supports at the four corners of each stand; the supports were of one piece with the stands. 
1KI.7.35	And on the top of the stand there was a round band half a cubit high; and on the top of the stand its stays and its panels were of one piece with it. 
1KI.7.36	And on the surfaces of its stays and on its panels, he carved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths round about. 
1KI.7.37	After this manner he made the ten stands; all of them were cast alike, of the same measure and the same form.
1KI.7.39	And he set the stands, five on the south side of the house, and five on the north side of the house; and he set the sea at the southeast corner of the house.
1KI.7.40	Hiram also made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram finished all the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of the 
1KI.7.41	the two pillars, the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars; 
1KI.7.42	and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars; 
1KI.7.43	the ten stands, and the ten lavers upon the stands; 
1KI.7.44	and the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath the sea.
1KI.7.45	Now the pots, the shovels, and the basins, all these vessels in the house of the 
1KI.7.46	In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan. 
1KI.7.47	And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because there were so many of them; the weight of the bronze was not found out.
1KI.7.48	So Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the 
1KI.7.49	the lampstands of pure gold, five on the south side and five on the north, before the inner sanctuary; the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold; 
1KI.7.50	the cups, snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and firepans, of pure gold; and the sockets of gold, for the doors of the innermost part of the house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the nave of the temple.
1KI.7.51	Thus all the work that King Solomon did on the house of the 
1KI.8.2	And all the men of Israel assembled to King Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month. 
1KI.8.3	And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. 
1KI.8.4	And they brought up the ark of the 
1KI.8.5	And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who had assembled before him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered. 
1KI.8.6	Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the 
1KI.8.7	For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim made a covering above the ark and its poles. 
1KI.8.8	And the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place before the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside; and they are there to this day. 
1KI.8.9	There was nothing in the ark except the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, where the 
1KI.8.10	 And when the priests came out of the holy place, a cloud filled the house of the 
1KI.8.11	so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud; for the glory of the 
1KI.8.12	“The 
1KI.8.12	but
1KI.8.13	I have built thee an exalted house,
1KI.8.13	a place for thee to dwell in for ever.”
1KI.8.14	Then the king faced about, and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel stood. 
1KI.8.15	And he said, “Blessed be the 
1KI.8.16	‘Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city in all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.’ 
1KI.8.17	Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the 
1KI.8.18	But the 
1KI.8.19	nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who shall be born to you shall build the house for my name.’ 
1KI.8.20	Now the 
1KI.8.21	And there I have provided a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of the 
1KI.8.22	Then Solomon stood before the altar of the 
1KI.8.23	and said, “O 
1KI.8.24	who hast kept with thy servant David my father what thou didst declare to him; yea, thou didst speak with thy mouth, and with thy hand hast fulfilled it this day. 
1KI.8.25	Now therefore, O 
1KI.8.26	Now therefore, O God of Israel, let thy word be confirmed, which thou hast spoken to thy servant David my father.
1KI.8.27	“But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built! 
1KI.8.28	Yet have regard to the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication, O 
1KI.8.29	that thy eyes may be open night and day toward this house, the place of which thou hast said, ‘My name shall be there,’ that thou mayest hearken to the prayer which thy servant offers toward this place. 
1KI.8.30	And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant and of thy people Israel, when they pray toward this place; yea, hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place; and when thou hearest, forgive.
1KI.8.31	“If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take an oath, and comes and swears his oath before thine altar in this house, 
1KI.8.32	then hear thou in heaven, and act, and judge thy servants, condemning the guilty by bringing his conduct upon his own head, and vindicating the righteous by rewarding him according to his righteousness.
1KI.8.33	“When thy people Israel are defeated before the enemy because they have sinned against thee, if they turn again to thee, and acknowledge thy name, and pray and make supplication to thee in this house; 
1KI.8.34	then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again to the land which thou gavest to their fathers.
1KI.8.35	“When heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against thee, if they pray toward this place, and acknowledge thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them, 
1KI.8.36	then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, thy people Israel, when thou dost teach them the good way in which they should walk; and grant rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people as an inheritance.
1KI.8.37	“If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence or blight or mildew or locust or caterpillar; if their enemy besieges them in any
1KI.8.38	whatever prayer, whatever supplication is made by any man or by all thy people Israel, each knowing the affliction of his own heart and stretching out his hands toward this house; 
1KI.8.39	then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and act, and render to each whose heart thou knowest, according to all his ways (for thou, thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men); 
1KI.8.40	that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest to our fathers.
1KI.8.41	“Likewise when a foreigner, who is not of thy people Israel, comes from a far country for thy name's sake 
1KI.8.42	(for they shall hear of thy great name, and thy mighty hand, and of thy outstretched arm), when he comes and prays toward this house, 
1KI.8.43	hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to thee; in order that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name and fear thee, as do thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.
1KI.8.44	“If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatever way thou shalt send them, and they pray to the 
1KI.8.45	then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
1KI.8.46	“If they sin against thee—for there is no man who does not sin—and thou art angry with them, and dost give them to an enemy, so that they are carried away captive to the land of the enemy, far off or near; 
1KI.8.47	yet if they lay it to heart in the land to which they have been carried captive, and repent, and make supplication to thee in the land of their captors, saying, ‘We have sinned, and have acted perversely and wickedly’; 
1KI.8.48	if they repent with all their mind and with all their heart in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive, and pray to thee toward their land, which thou gavest to their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name; 
1KI.8.49	then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause 
1KI.8.50	and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions which they have committed against thee; and grant them compassion in the sight of those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them 
1KI.8.51	(for they are thy people, and thy heritage, which thou didst bring out of Egypt, from the midst of the iron furnace). 
1KI.8.52	Let thy eyes be open to the supplication of thy servant, and to the supplication of thy people Israel, giving ear to them whenever they call to thee. 
1KI.8.53	For thou didst separate them from among all the peoples of the earth, to be thy heritage, as thou didst declare through Moses, thy servant, when thou didst bring our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord 
1KI.8.54	Now as Solomon finished offering all this prayer and supplication to the 
1KI.8.55	and he stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying, 
1KI.8.56	“Blessed be the 
1KI.8.57	The 
1KI.8.58	that he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, his statutes, and his ordinances, which he commanded our fathers. 
1KI.8.59	Let these words of mine, wherewith I have made supplication before the 
1KI.8.60	that all the peoples of the earth may know that the 
1KI.8.61	Let your heart therefore be wholly true to the 
1KI.8.63	Solomon offered as peace offerings to the 
1KI.8.64	The same day the king consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the 
1KI.8.65	So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt, before the 
1KI.8.66	On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went to their homes joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the 
1KI.9.2	the 
1KI.9.3	And the 
1KI.9.4	And as for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, with integrity of heart and uprightness, doing according to all that I have commanded you, and keeping my statutes and my ordinances, 
1KI.9.5	then I will establish your royal throne over Israel for ever, as I promised David your father, saying, ‘There shall not fail you a man upon the throne of Israel.’ 
1KI.9.6	But if you turn aside from following me, you or your children, and do not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them, 
1KI.9.7	then I will cut off Israel from the land which I have given them; and the house which I have consecrated for my name I will cast out of my sight; and Israel will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples. 
1KI.9.8	And this house will become a heap of ruins;
1KI.9.9	Then they will say, ‘Because they forsook the 
1KI.9.11	and Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress timber and gold, as much as he desired, King Solomon gave to Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. 
1KI.9.12	But when Hiram came from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him, they did not please him. 
1KI.9.13	Therefore he said, “What kind of cities are these which you have given me, my brother?” So they are called the land of Cabul to this day. 
1KI.9.14	Hiram had sent to the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold.
1KI.9.15	And this is the account of the forced labor which King Solomon levied to build the house of the 
1KI.9.16	(Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and captured Gezer and burnt it with fire, and had slain the Canaanites who dwelt in the city, and had given it as dowry to his daughter, Solomon's wife; 
1KI.9.17	so Solomon rebuilt Gezer) and Lower Beth-horon 
1KI.9.18	and Baalath and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land of Judah,
1KI.9.19	and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. 
1KI.9.20	All the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the people of Israel— 
1KI.9.21	their descendants who were left after them in the land, whom the people of Israel were unable to destroy utterly—these Solomon made a forced levy of slaves, and so they are to this day. 
1KI.9.22	But of the people of Israel Solomon made no slaves; they were the soldiers, they were his officials, his commanders, his captains, his chariot commanders and his horsemen.
1KI.9.23	These were the chief officers who were over Solomon's work: five hundred and fifty, who had charge of the people who carried on the work.
1KI.9.24	But Pharaoh's daughter went up from the city of David to her own house which Solomon had built for her; then he built the Millo.
1KI.9.25	Three times a year Solomon used to offer up burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built to the 
1KI.9.26	King Solomon built a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom. 
1KI.9.27	And Hiram sent with the fleet his servants, seamen who were familiar with the sea, together with the servants of Solomon; 
1KI.9.28	and they went to Ophir, and brought from there gold, to the amount of four hundred and twenty talents; and they brought it to King Solomon.
1KI.10.2	She came to Jerusalem with a very great retinue, with camels bearing spices, and very much gold, and precious stones; and when she came to Solomon, she told him all that was on her mind. 
1KI.10.3	And Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing hidden from the king which he could not explain to her. 
1KI.10.4	And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built, 
1KI.10.5	the food of his table, the seating of his officials, and the attendance of his servants, their clothing, his cupbearers, and his burnt offerings which he offered at the house of the 
1KI.10.6	And she said to the king, “The report was true which I heard in my own land of your affairs and of your wisdom, 
1KI.10.7	but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes had seen it; and behold, the half was not told me; your wisdom and prosperity surpass the report which I heard. 
1KI.10.8	Happy are your wives!
1KI.10.9	Blessed be the 
1KI.10.10	Then she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and a very great quantity of spices, and precious stones; never again came such an abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
1KI.10.11	Moreover the fleet of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, brought from Ophir a very great amount of almug wood and precious stones. 
1KI.10.12	And the king made of the almug wood supports for the house of the 
1KI.10.13	And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired, whatever she asked besides what was given her by the bounty of King Solomon. So she turned and went back to her own land, with her servants.
1KI.10.14	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold, 
1KI.10.15	besides that which came from the traders and from the traffic of the merchants, and from all the kings of Arabia and from the governors of the land. 
1KI.10.16	King Solomon made two hundred large shields of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of gold went into each shield. 
1KI.10.17	And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three minas of gold went into each shield; and the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon. 
1KI.10.18	The king also made a great ivory throne, and overlaid it with the finest gold. 
1KI.10.19	The throne had six steps, and at the back of the throne was a calf's head, and on each side of the seat were arm rests and two lions standing beside the arm rests, 
1KI.10.20	while twelve lions stood there, one on each end of a step on the six steps. The like of it was never made in any kingdom. 
1KI.10.21	All King Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver, it was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon. 
1KI.10.22	For the king had a fleet of ships of Tarshish at sea with the fleet of Hiram. Once every three years the fleet of ships of Tarshish used to come bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
1KI.10.23	Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom. 
1KI.10.24	And the whole earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his mind. 
1KI.10.25	Every one of them brought his present, articles of silver and gold, garments, myrrh, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year.
1KI.10.26	And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. 
1KI.10.27	And the king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah. 
1KI.10.28	And Solomon's import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, and the king's traders received them from Kue at a price. 
1KI.10.29	A chariot could be imported from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so through the king's traders they were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.
1KI.11.1	Now King Solomon loved many foreign women: the daughter of Pharaoh, and Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women, 
1KI.11.2	from the nations concerning which the 
1KI.11.3	He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart. 
1KI.11.4	For when Solomon was old his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not wholly true to the 
1KI.11.5	For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. 
1KI.11.6	So Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the 
1KI.11.7	Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites, on the mountain east of Jerusalem. 
1KI.11.8	And so he did for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.
1KI.11.9	And the 
1KI.11.10	and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods; but he did not keep what the 
1KI.11.11	Therefore the 
1KI.11.12	Yet for the sake of David your father I will not do it in your days, but I will tear it out of the hand of your son. 
1KI.11.13	However I will not tear away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to your son, for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem which I have chosen.”
1KI.11.14	And the 
1KI.11.15	For when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army went up to bury the slain, he slew every male in Edom 
1KI.11.16	(for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom); 
1KI.11.17	but Hadad fled to Egypt, together with certain Edomites of his father's servants, Hadad being yet a little child. 
1KI.11.18	They set out from Midian and came to Paran, and took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and assigned him an allowance of food, and gave him land. 
1KI.11.19	And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen. 
1KI.11.20	And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh's house among the sons of Pharaoh. 
1KI.11.21	But when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.” 
1KI.11.22	But Pharaoh said to him, “What have you lacked with me that you are now seeking to go to your own country?” And he said to him, “Only let me go.”
1KI.11.23	God also raised up as an adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his master Hadad-ezer king of Zobah. 
1KI.11.24	And he gathered men about him and became leader of a marauding band, after the slaughter by David; and they went to Damascus, and dwelt there, and made him king in Damascus. 
1KI.11.25	He was an adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon, doing mischief as Hadad did; and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.
1KI.11.26	Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow, also lifted up his hand against the king. 
1KI.11.27	And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king. Solomon built the Millo, and closed up the breach of the city of David his father. 
1KI.11.28	The man Jeroboam was very able, and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious he gave him charge over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph. 
1KI.11.29	And at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road. Now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment; and the two of them were alone in the open country. 
1KI.11.30	Then Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it into twelve pieces. 
1KI.11.31	And he said to Jeroboam, “Take for yourself ten pieces; for thus says the 
1KI.11.32	(but he shall have one tribe, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel), 
1KI.11.33	because he has
1KI.11.34	Nevertheless I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him ruler all the days of his life, for the sake of David my servant whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes; 
1KI.11.35	but I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it to you, ten tribes. 
1KI.11.36	Yet to his son I will give one tribe, that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen to put my name. 
1KI.11.37	And I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your soul desires, and you shall be king over Israel. 
1KI.11.38	And if you will hearken to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did, I will be with you, and will build you a sure house, as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you. 
1KI.11.39	And I will for this afflict the descendants of David, but not for ever.’ ” 
1KI.11.40	Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
1KI.11.41	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon? 
1KI.11.42	 And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years. 
1KI.11.43	And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father; and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.12.2	And when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was still in Egypt, whither he had fled from King Solomon), then Jeroboam returned from
1KI.12.3	And they sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came and said to Rehoboam, 
1KI.12.4	“Your father made our yoke heavy. Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke upon us, and we will serve you.” 
1KI.12.5	He said to them, “Depart for three days, then come again to me.” So the people went away.
1KI.12.6	Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he was yet alive, saying, “How do you advise me to answer this people?” 
1KI.12.7	And they said to him, “If you will be a servant to this people today and serve them, and speak good words to them when you answer them, then they will be your servants for ever.” 
1KI.12.8	But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him. 
1KI.12.9	And he said to them, “What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, ‘Lighten the yoke that your father put upon us’?” 
1KI.12.10	And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, “Thus shall you speak to this people who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but do you lighten it for us’; thus shall you say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father's loins. 
1KI.12.11	And now, whereas my father laid upon you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.’ ”
1KI.12.12	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king said, “Come to me again the third day.” 
1KI.12.13	And the king answered the people harshly, and forsaking the counsel which the old men had given him, 
1KI.12.14	he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.” 
1KI.12.15	So the king did not hearken to the people; for it was a turn of affairs brought about by the 
1KI.12.16	And when all Israel saw that the king did not hearken to them, the people answered the king,
1KI.12.16	“What portion have we in David?
1KI.12.16	We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse.
1KI.12.16	To your tents, O Israel!
1KI.12.16	Look now to your own house, David.”
1KI.12.16	So Israel departed to their tents. 
1KI.12.17	But Rehoboam reigned over the people of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah. 
1KI.12.18	Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was taskmaster over the forced labor, and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. And King Rehoboam made haste to mount his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. 
1KI.12.19	So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day. 
1KI.12.20	And when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. There was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
1KI.12.21	When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. 
1KI.12.22	 But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God: 
1KI.12.23	“Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, 
1KI.12.24	‘Thus says the 
1KI.12.25	Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and dwelt there; and he went out from there and built Penuel. 
1KI.12.26	And Jeroboam said in his heart, “Now the kingdom will turn back to the house of David; 
1KI.12.27	if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the 
1KI.12.28	So the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold. And he said to the people, “You have gone up to Jerusalem long enough. Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.” 
1KI.12.29	And he set one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan. 
1KI.12.30	And this thing became a sin, for the people went to the one at Bethel and to the other as far as Dan.
1KI.12.31	He also made houses on high places, and appointed priests from among all the people, who were not of the Levites. 
1KI.12.32	And Jeroboam appointed a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month like the feast that was in Judah, and he offered sacrifices upon the altar; so he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he made. And he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places that he had made. 
1KI.12.33	He went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and he ordained a feast for the people of Israel, and went up to the altar to burn incense.
1KI.13.1	And behold, a man of God came out of Judah by the word of the 
1KI.13.2	And the man cried against the altar by the word of the 
1KI.13.3	And he gave a sign the same day, saying, “This is the sign that the 
1KI.13.4	And when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar at Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, “Lay hold of him.” And his hand, which he stretched out against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back to himself. 
1KI.13.5	The altar also was torn down, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the 
1KI.13.6	And the king said to the man of God, “Entreat now the favor of the 
1KI.13.7	And the king said to the man of God, “Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.” 
1KI.13.8	And the man of God said to the king, “If you give me half your house, I will not go in with you. And I will not eat bread or drink water in this place; 
1KI.13.9	for so was it commanded me by the word of the 
1KI.13.10	So he went another way, and did not return by the way that he came to Bethel.
1KI.13.11	Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel. And his sons
1KI.13.12	And their father said to them, “Which way did he go?” And his sons showed him the way which the man of God who came from Judah had gone. 
1KI.13.13	And he said to his sons, “Saddle the ass for me.” So they saddled the ass for him and he mounted it. 
1KI.13.14	And he went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak; and he said to him, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?” And he said, “I am.” 
1KI.13.15	Then he said to him, “Come home with me and eat bread.” 
1KI.13.16	And he said, “I may not return with you, or go in with you; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place; 
1KI.13.17	for it was said to me by the word of the 
1KI.13.18	And he said to him, “I also am a prophet as you are, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the 
1KI.13.19	So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water.
1KI.13.20	And as they sat at the table, the word of the 
1KI.13.21	and he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, “Thus says the 
1KI.13.22	but have come back, and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you, “Eat no bread, and drink no water”; your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.’ ” 
1KI.13.23	And after he had eaten bread and drunk, he saddled the ass for the prophet whom he had brought back. 
1KI.13.24	And as he went away a lion met him on the road and killed him. And his body was thrown in the road, and the ass stood beside it; the lion also stood beside the body. 
1KI.13.25	And behold, men passed by, and saw the body thrown in the road, and the lion standing by the body. And they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
1KI.13.26	And when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard of it, he said, “It is the man of God, who disobeyed the word of the 
1KI.13.27	And he said to his sons, “Saddle the ass for me.” And they saddled it. 
1KI.13.28	And he went and found his body thrown in the road, and the ass and the lion standing beside the body. The lion had not eaten the body or torn the ass. 
1KI.13.29	And the prophet took up the body of the man of God and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back to the city,
1KI.13.30	And he laid the body in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, “Alas, my brother!” 
1KI.13.31	And after he had buried him, he said to his sons, “When I die, bury me in the grave in which the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones. 
1KI.13.32	For the saying which he cried by the word of the 
1KI.13.33	After this thing Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but made priests for the high places again from among all the people; any who would, he consecrated to be priests of the high places. 
1KI.13.34	And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, so as to cut it off and to destroy it from the face of the earth.
1KI.14.1	At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick. 
1KI.14.2	And Jeroboam said to his wife, “Arise, and disguise yourself, that it be not known that you are the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh; behold, Ahijah the prophet is there, who said of me that I should be king over this people. 
1KI.14.3	Take with you ten loaves, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him; he will tell you what shall happen to the child.”
1KI.14.4	Jeroboam's wife did so; she arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were dim because of his age. 
1KI.14.5	And the 
1KI.14.5	When she came, she pretended to be another woman. 
1KI.14.6	But when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam; why do you pretend to be another? For I am charged with heavy tidings for you. 
1KI.14.7	Go, tell Jeroboam, ‘Thus says the 
1KI.14.8	and tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you; and yet you have not been like my servant David, who kept my commandments, and followed me with all his heart, doing only that which was right in my eyes, 
1KI.14.9	but you have done evil above all that were before you and have gone and made for yourself other gods, and molten images, provoking me to anger, and have cast me behind your back; 
1KI.14.10	therefore behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every male, both bond and free in Israel, and will utterly consume the house of Jeroboam, as a man burns up dung until it is all gone. 
1KI.14.11	Any one belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city the dogs shall eat; and any one who dies in the open country the birds of the air shall eat; for the 
1KI.14.12	Arise therefore, go to your house. When your feet enter the city, the child shall die. 
1KI.14.13	And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him; for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found something pleasing to the 
1KI.14.14	Moreover the 
1KI.14.15	the 
1KI.14.16	And he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he sinned and which he made Israel to sin.”
1KI.14.17	Then Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah. And as she came to the threshold of the house, the child died. 
1KI.14.18	And all Israel buried him and mourned for him, according to the word of the 
1KI.14.19	Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 
1KI.14.20	And the time that Jeroboam reigned was twenty-two years; and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.14.21	Now Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the 
1KI.14.22	And Judah did what was evil in the sight of the 
1KI.14.23	For they also built for themselves high places, and pillars, and Asherim on every high hill and under every green tree; 
1KI.14.24	and there were also male cult prostitutes in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nation which the 
1KI.14.26	he took away the treasures of the house of the 
1KI.14.27	and King Rehoboam made in their stead shields of bronze, and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard, who kept the door of the king's house. 
1KI.14.28	And as often as the king went into the house of the 
1KI.14.29	Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
1KI.14.30	And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. 
1KI.14.31	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. His mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.15.2	He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom. 
1KI.15.3	And he walked in all the sins which his father did before him; and his heart was not wholly true to the 
1KI.15.4	Nevertheless for David's sake the 
1KI.15.5	because David did what was right in the eyes of the 
1KI.15.6	Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life. 
1KI.15.7	The rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. 
1KI.15.8	 And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David. And Asa his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.15.9	In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa began to reign over Judah, 
1KI.15.10	and he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom. 
1KI.15.11	And Asa did what was right in the eyes of the 
1KI.15.12	He put away the male cult prostitutes out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. 
1KI.15.13	 He also removed Maacah his mother from being queen mother because she had an abominable image made for Asherah; and Asa cut down her image and burned it at the brook Kidron. 
1KI.15.14	But the high places were not taken away. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was wholly true to the 
1KI.15.15	And he brought into the house of the 
1KI.15.16	And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. 
1KI.15.17	Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might permit no one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 
1KI.15.18	Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the 
1KI.15.19	“Let there be a league between me and you, as between my father and your father: behold, I am sending to you a present of silver and gold; go, break your league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may withdraw from me.” 
1KI.15.20	And Ben-hadad hearkened to King Asa, and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali. 
1KI.15.21	And when Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah, and he dwelt in Tirzah. 
1KI.15.22	Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah, none was exempt, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber, with which Baasha had been building; and with them King Asa built Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah. 
1KI.15.23	 Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? But in his old age he was diseased in his feet. 
1KI.15.24	 And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.15.25	Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah; and he reigned over Israel two years. 
1KI.15.26	He did what was evil in the sight of the 
1KI.15.27	Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha struck him down at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon. 
1KI.15.28	So Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead. 
1KI.15.29	And as soon as he was king, he killed all the house of Jeroboam; he left to the house of Jeroboam not one that breathed, until he had destroyed it, according to the word of the 
1KI.15.30	it was for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned and which he made Israel to sin, and because of the anger to which he provoked the 
1KI.15.31	Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
1KI.15.32	And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
1KI.15.33	In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah began to reign over all Israel at Tirzah, and he reigned twenty-four years. 
1KI.15.34	He did what was evil in the sight of the 
1KI.16.1	And the word of the 
1KI.16.2	“Since I exalted you out of the dust and made you leader over my people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam, and have made my people Israel to sin, provoking me to anger with their sins, 
1KI.16.3	behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 
1KI.16.4	Any one belonging to Baasha who dies in the city the dogs shall eat; and any one of his who dies in the field the birds of the air shall eat.”
1KI.16.5	Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
1KI.16.6	And Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried at Tirzah; and Elah his son reigned in his stead. 
1KI.16.7	Moreover the word of the 
1KI.16.8	In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah, and he reigned two years. 
1KI.16.9	But his servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against him. When he was at Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah, 
1KI.16.10	Zimri came in and struck him down and killed him, in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
1KI.16.11	When he began to reign, as soon as he had seated himself on his throne, he killed all the house of Baasha; he did not leave him a single male of his kinsmen or his friends. 
1KI.16.12	Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the 
1KI.16.13	for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son which they sinned, and which they made Israel to sin, provoking the 
1KI.16.14	Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
1KI.16.15	In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the troops were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, 
1KI.16.16	and the troops who were encamped heard it said, “Zimri has conspired, and he has killed the king”; therefore all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp. 
1KI.16.17	So Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah. 
1KI.16.18	And when Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the king's house, and burned the king's house over him with fire, and died, 
1KI.16.19	because of his sins which he committed, doing evil in the sight of the 
1KI.16.20	Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and the conspiracy which he made, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
1KI.16.21	Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts; half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king, and half followed Omri. 
1KI.16.22	But the people who followed Omri overcame the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath; so Tibni died, and Omri became king. 
1KI.16.23	In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel and he reigned for twelve years; six years he reigned in Tirzah. 
1KI.16.24	He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver; and he fortified the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, Samaria, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill.
1KI.16.25	Omri did what was evil in the sight of the 
1KI.16.26	For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in the sins which he made Israel to sin, provoking the 
1KI.16.27	Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and the might that he showed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
1KI.16.28	And Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.16.29	In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri began to reign over Israel, and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years. 
1KI.16.30	And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.16.31	And as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, he took for wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshiped him. 
1KI.16.32	He erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he built in Samaria. 
1KI.16.33	And Ahab made an Asherah. Ahab did more to provoke the 
1KI.16.34	 In his days Hiel of Bethel built Jericho; he laid its foundation at the cost of Abiram his first-born, and set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the 
1KI.17.2	And the word of the 
1KI.17.3	“Depart from here and turn eastward, and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, that is east of the Jordan. 
1KI.17.4	You shall drink from the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.” 
1KI.17.5	So he went and did according to the word of the 
1KI.17.6	And the ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening; and he drank from the brook. 
1KI.17.7	And after a while the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.
1KI.17.9	“Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and dwell there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to feed you.” 
1KI.17.10	So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks; and he called to her and said, “Bring me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.” 
1KI.17.11	And as she was going to bring it, he called to her and said, “Bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.” 
1KI.17.12	And she said, “As the 
1KI.17.13	And Elijah said to her, “Fear not; go and do as you have said; but first make me a little cake of it and bring it to me, and afterward make for yourself and your son. 
1KI.17.14	For thus says the 
1KI.17.15	And she went and did as Elijah said; and she, and he, and her household ate for many days. 
1KI.17.16	The jar of meal was not spent, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the 
1KI.17.17	After this the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became ill; and his illness was so severe that there was no breath left in him. 
1KI.17.18	 And she said to Elijah, “What have you against me, O man of God? You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to cause the death of my son!” 
1KI.17.19	And he said to her, “Give me your son.” And he took him from her bosom, and carried him up into the upper chamber, where he lodged, and laid him upon his own bed. 
1KI.17.20	And he cried to the 
1KI.17.21	Then he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried to the 
1KI.17.22	And the 
1KI.17.23	And Elijah took the child, and brought him down from the upper chamber into the house, and delivered him to his mother; and Elijah said, “See, your son lives.” 
1KI.17.24	And the woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the 
1KI.18.1	After many days the word of the 
1KI.18.2	So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria. 
1KI.18.3	And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah revered the 
1KI.18.4	and when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the 
1KI.18.5	And Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys; perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, and not lose some of the animals.” 
1KI.18.6	So they divided the land between them to pass through it; Ahab went in one direction by himself, and Obadiah went in another direction by himself.
1KI.18.7	And as Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him; and Obadiah recognized him, and fell on his face, and said, “Is it you, my lord Elijah?” 
1KI.18.8	And he answered him, “It is I. Go, tell your lord, ‘Behold, Elijah is here.’ ” 
1KI.18.9	And he said, “Wherein have I sinned, that you would give your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me? 
1KI.18.10	As the 
1KI.18.11	And now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord, “Behold, Elijah is here.” ’ 
1KI.18.12	And as soon as I have gone from you, the Spirit of the 
1KI.18.13	Has it not been told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the 
1KI.18.14	And now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord, “Behold, Elijah is here” ’; and he will kill me.” 
1KI.18.15	And Elijah said, “As the 
1KI.18.16	So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
1KI.18.17	When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, “Is it you, you troubler of Israel?” 
1KI.18.18	And he answered, “I have not troubled Israel; but you have, and your father's house, because you have forsaken the commandments of the 
1KI.18.19	Now therefore send and gather all Israel to me at Mount Carmel, and the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table.”
1KI.18.20	So Ahab sent to all the people of Israel, and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel. 
1KI.18.21	And Elijah came near to all the people, and said, “How long will you go limping with two different opinions? If the 
1KI.18.22	Then Elijah said to the people, “I, even I only, am left a prophet of the 
1KI.18.23	Let two bulls be given to us; and let them choose one bull for themselves, and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it; and I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood, and put no fire to it. 
1KI.18.24	And you call on the name of your god and I will call on the name of the 
1KI.18.25	Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first, for you are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire to it.” 
1KI.18.26	And they took the bull which was given them, and they prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, “O Baal, answer us!” But there was no voice, and no one answered. And they limped about the altar which they had made. 
1KI.18.27	And at noon Elijah mocked them, saying, “Cry aloud, for he is a god; either he is musing, or he has gone aside, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.” 
1KI.18.28	And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their custom with swords and lances, until the blood gushed out upon them. 
1KI.18.29	And as midday passed, they raved on until the time of the offering of the oblation, but there was no voice; no one answered, no one heeded.
1KI.18.30	Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me”; and all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the 
1KI.18.31	Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the 
1KI.18.32	and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the 
1KI.18.33	And he put the wood in order, and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood. And he said, “Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt offering, and on the wood.” 
1KI.18.34	And he said, “Do it a second time”; and they did it a second time. And he said, “Do it a third time”; and they did it a third time. 
1KI.18.35	And the water ran round about the altar, and filled the trench also with water.
1KI.18.36	And at the time of the offering of the oblation, Elijah the prophet came near and said, “O 
1KI.18.37	Answer me, O 
1KI.18.38	Then the fire of the 
1KI.18.39	And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces; and they said, “The 
1KI.18.40	And Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.” And they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and killed them there.
1KI.18.41	And Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of the rushing of rain.” 
1KI.18.42	So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees. 
1KI.18.43	And he said to his servant, “Go up now, look toward the sea.” And he went up and looked, and said, “There is nothing.” And he said, “Go again seven times.” 
1KI.18.44	And at the seventh time he said, “Behold, a little cloud like a man's hand is rising out of the sea.” And he said, “Go up, say to Ahab, ‘Prepare your chariot and go down, lest the rain stop you.’ ” 
1KI.18.45	And in a little while the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode and went to Jezreel. 
1KI.18.46	And the hand of the 
1KI.19.1	Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had slain all the prophets with the sword. 
1KI.19.2	Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “So may the gods do to me and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by this time tomorrow.” 
1KI.19.3	Then he was afraid, and he arose and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.
1KI.19.4	But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a broom tree; and he asked that he might die, saying, “It is enough; now, O 
1KI.19.5	And he lay down and slept under a broom tree; and behold, an angel touched him, and said to him, “Arise and eat.” 
1KI.19.6	And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water. And he ate and drank, and lay down again. 
1KI.19.7	And the angel of the 
1KI.19.8	And he arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God.
1KI.19.9	And there he came to a cave, and lodged there; and behold, the word of the 
1KI.19.10	 He said, “I have been very jealous for the 
1KI.19.11	And he said, “Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the 
1KI.19.12	and after the earthquake a fire, but the 
1KI.19.13	And when Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. And behold, there came a voice to him, and said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?” 
1KI.19.14	He said, “I have been very jealous for the 
1KI.19.15	And the 
1KI.19.16	and Jehu the son of Nimshi you shall anoint to be king over Israel; and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah you shall anoint to be prophet in your place. 
1KI.19.17	And him who escapes from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay; and him who escapes from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay. 
1KI.19.18	 Yet I will leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him.”
1KI.19.19	So he departed from there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing, with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he was with the twelfth. Elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him. 
1KI.19.20	And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, “Let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.” And he said to him, “Go back again; for what have I done to you?” 
1KI.19.21	And he returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the yokes of the oxen, and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose and went after Elijah, and ministered to him.
1KI.20.1	Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army together; thirty-two kings were with him, and horses and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it. 
1KI.20.2	And he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel, and said to him, “Thus says Ben-hadad: 
1KI.20.3	‘Your silver and your gold are mine; your fairest wives and children also are mine.’ ” 
1KI.20.4	And the king of Israel answered, “As you say, my lord, O king, I am yours, and all that I have.” 
1KI.20.5	The messengers came again, and said, “Thus says Ben-hadad: ‘I sent to you, saying, “Deliver to me your silver and your gold, your wives and your children”; 
1KI.20.6	nevertheless I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants, and lay hands on whatever pleases them,
1KI.20.7	Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, “Mark, now, and see how this man is seeking trouble; for he sent to me for my wives and my children, and for my silver and my gold, and I did not refuse him.” 
1KI.20.8	And all the elders and all the people said to him, “Do not heed or consent.” 
1KI.20.9	So he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad, “Tell my lord the king, ‘All that you first demanded of your servant I will do; but this thing I cannot do.’ ” And the messengers departed and brought him word again. 
1KI.20.10	Ben-hadad sent to him and said, “The gods do so to me and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people who follow me.” 
1KI.20.11	And the king of Israel answered, “Tell him, ‘Let not him that girds on his armor boast himself as he that puts it off.’ ” 
1KI.20.12	When Ben-hadad heard this message as he was drinking with the kings in the booths, he said to his men, “Take your positions.” And they took their positions against the city.
1KI.20.13	And behold, a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel and said, “Thus says the 
1KI.20.14	And Ahab said, “By whom?” He said, “Thus says the 
1KI.20.15	Then he mustered the servants of the governors of the districts, and they were two hundred and thirty-two; and after them he mustered all the people of Israel, seven thousand.
1KI.20.16	And they went out at noon, while Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the booths, he and the thirty-two kings who helped him. 
1KI.20.17	The servants of the governors of the districts went out first. And Ben-hadad sent out scouts, and they reported to him, “Men are coming out from Samaria.” 
1KI.20.18	He said, “If they have come out for peace, take them alive; or if they have come out for war, take them alive.”
1KI.20.19	So these went out of the city, the servants of the governors of the districts, and the army which followed them. 
1KI.20.20	And each killed his man; the Syrians fled and Israel pursued them, but Ben-hadad king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen. 
1KI.20.21	And the king of Israel went out, and captured
1KI.20.22	Then the prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said to him, “Come, strengthen yourself, and consider well what you have to do; for in the spring the king of Syria will come up against you.”
1KI.20.23	And the servants of the king of Syria said to him, “Their gods are gods of the hills, and so they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. 
1KI.20.24	And do this: remove the kings, each from his post, and put commanders in their places; 
1KI.20.25	and muster an army like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; then we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.” And he hearkened to their voice, and did so.
1KI.20.26	In the spring Ben-hadad mustered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel. 
1KI.20.27	And the people of Israel were mustered, and were provisioned, and went against them; the people of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of goats, but the Syrians filled the country. 
1KI.20.28	And a man of God came near and said to the king of Israel, “Thus says the 
1KI.20.29	And they encamped opposite one another seven days. Then on the seventh day the battle was joined; and the people of Israel smote of the Syrians a hundred thousand foot soldiers in one day. 
1KI.20.30	And the rest fled into the city of Aphek; and the wall fell upon twenty-seven thousand men that were left.
1KI.20.30	Ben-hadad also fled, and entered an inner chamber in the city. 
1KI.20.31	And his servants said to him, “Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings; let us put sackcloth on our loins and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; perhaps he will spare your life.” 
1KI.20.32	So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and went to the king of Israel and said, “Your servant Ben-hadad says, ‘Pray, let me live.’ ” And he said, “Does he still live? He is my brother.” 
1KI.20.33	Now the men were watching for an omen, and they quickly took it up from him and said, “Yes, your brother Ben-hadad.” Then he said, “Go and bring him.” Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot. 
1KI.20.34	And Ben-hadad said to him, “The cities which my father took from your father I will restore; and you may establish bazaars for yourself in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.” And Ahab said, “I will let you go on these terms.” So he made a covenant with him and let him go.
1KI.20.35	And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow at the command of the 
1KI.20.36	Then he said to him, “Because you have not obeyed the voice of the 
1KI.20.37	Then he found another man, and said, “Strike me, I pray.” And the man struck him, smiting and wounding him. 
1KI.20.38	So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes. 
1KI.20.39	And as the king passed, he cried to the king and said, “Your servant went out into the midst of the battle; and behold, a soldier turned and brought a man to me, and said, ‘Keep this man; if by any means he be missing, your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.’ 
1KI.20.40	And as your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.” The king of Israel said to him, “So shall your judgment be; you yourself have decided it.” 
1KI.20.41	Then he made haste to take the bandage away from his eyes; and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets. 
1KI.20.42	And he said to him, “Thus says the 
1KI.20.43	And the king of Israel went to his house resentful and sullen, and came to Samaria.
1KI.21.1	Now Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel, beside the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. 
1KI.21.2	And after this Ahab said to Naboth, “Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near my house; and I will give you a better vineyard for it; or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its value in money.” 
1KI.21.3	But Naboth said to Ahab, “The 
1KI.21.4	And Ahab went into his house vexed and sullen because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had said to him; for he had said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” And he lay down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no food.
1KI.21.5	But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, “Why is your spirit so vexed that you eat no food?” 
1KI.21.6	And he said to her, “Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, ‘Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it please you, I will give you another vineyard for it’; and he answered, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’ ” 
1KI.21.7	And Jezebel his wife said to him, “Do you now govern Israel? Arise, and eat bread, and let your heart be cheerful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”
1KI.21.8	So she wrote letters in Ahab's name and sealed them with his seal, and she sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who dwelt with Naboth in his city. 
1KI.21.9	And she wrote in the letters, “Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people; 
1KI.21.10	and set two base fellows opposite him, and let them bring a charge against him, saying, ‘You have cursed God and the king.’ Then take him out, and stone him to death.” 
1KI.21.11	And the men of his city, the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city, did as Jezebel had sent word to them. As it was written in the letters which she had sent to them, 
1KI.21.12	they proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people. 
1KI.21.13	And the two base fellows came in and sat opposite him; and the base fellows brought a charge against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, “Naboth cursed God and the king.” So they took him outside the city, and stoned him to death with stones. 
1KI.21.14	Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, “Naboth has been stoned; he is dead.”
1KI.21.15	As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, “Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.” 
1KI.21.16	And as soon as Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
1KI.21.17	Then the word of the 
1KI.21.18	“Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria; behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession. 
1KI.21.19	 And you shall say to him, ‘Thus says the 
1KI.21.20	Ahab said to Elijah, “Have you found me, O my enemy?” He answered, “I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do what is evil in the sight of the 
1KI.21.21	Behold, I will bring evil upon you; I will utterly sweep you away, and will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel; 
1KI.21.22	and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the anger to which you have provoked me, and because you have made Israel to sin. 
1KI.21.23	 And of Jezebel the 
1KI.21.24	Any one belonging to Ahab who dies in the city the dogs shall eat; and any one of his who dies in the open country the birds of the air shall eat.”
1KI.21.25	(There was none who sold himself to do what was evil in the sight of the 
1KI.21.26	He did very abominably in going after idols, as the Amorites had done, whom the 
1KI.21.27	And when Ahab heard those words, he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted and lay in sackcloth, and went about dejectedly. 
1KI.21.28	And the word of the 
1KI.21.29	“Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but in his son's days I will bring the evil upon his house.”
1KI.22.2	But in the third year Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel. 
1KI.22.3	And the king of Israel said to his servants, “Do you know that Ramoth-gilead belongs to us, and we keep quiet and do not take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?” 
1KI.22.4	And he said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead?” And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”
1KI.22.5	And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Inquire first for the word of the 
1KI.22.6	Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall I go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I forbear?” And they said, “Go up; for the Lord will give it into the hand of the king.” 
1KI.22.7	But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not here another prophet of the 
1KI.22.8	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the 
1KI.22.9	Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, “Bring quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.” 
1KI.22.10	Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes, at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them. 
1KI.22.11	And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron, and said, “Thus says the 
1KI.22.12	And all the prophets prophesied so, and said, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and triumph; the 
1KI.22.13	And the messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him, “Behold, the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king; let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably.” 
1KI.22.14	But Micaiah said, “As the 
1KI.22.15	And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?” And he answered him, “Go up and triumph; the 
1KI.22.16	But the king said to him, “How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the 
1KI.22.17	 And he said, “I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd; and the 
1KI.22.18	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?” 
1KI.22.19	And Micaiah said, “Therefore hear the word of the 
1KI.22.20	and the 
1KI.22.21	Then a spirit came forward and stood before the 
1KI.22.22	And the 
1KI.22.23	Now therefore behold, the 
1KI.22.24	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, “How did the Spirit of the 
1KI.22.25	And Micaiah said, “Behold, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.” 
1KI.22.26	And the king of Israel said, “Seize Micaiah, and take him back to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king's son; 
1KI.22.27	and say, ‘Thus says the king, “Put this fellow in prison, and feed him with scant fare of bread and water, until I come in peace.” ’ ” 
1KI.22.28	And Micaiah said, “If you return in peace, the 
1KI.22.29	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. 
1KI.22.30	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your robes.” And the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle. 
1KI.22.31	Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, “Fight with neither small nor great, but only with the king of Israel.” 
1KI.22.32	And when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “It is surely the king of Israel.” So they turned to fight against him; and Jehoshaphat cried out. 
1KI.22.33	And when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him. 
1KI.22.34	But a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and struck the king of Israel between the scale armor and the breastplate; therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn about, and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded.” 
1KI.22.35	And the battle grew hot that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians, until at evening he died; and the blood of the wound flowed into the bottom of the chariot. 
1KI.22.36	And about sunset a cry went through the army, “Every man to his city, and every man to his country!”
1KI.22.37	So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria. 
1KI.22.38	And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood, and the harlots washed themselves in it, according to the word of the 
1KI.22.39	Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
1KI.22.40	So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.22.41	Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. 
1KI.22.42	Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 
1KI.22.43	He walked in all the way of Asa his father; he did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the sight of the 
1KI.22.44	Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel.
1KI.22.45	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
1KI.22.46	And the remnant of the male cult prostitutes who remained in the days of his father Asa, he exterminated from the land.
1KI.22.47	There was no king in Edom; a deputy was king. 
1KI.22.48	 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold; but they did not go, for the ships were wrecked at Ezion-geber. 
1KI.22.49	Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my servants go with your servants in the ships,” but Jehoshaphat was not willing. 
1KI.22.50	 And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.22.51	Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel. 
1KI.22.52	He did what was evil in the sight of the 
1KI.22.53	He served Baal and worshiped him, and provoked the 
2KI.1.1	After the death of Ahab, Moab rebelled against Israel.
2KI.1.2	Now Ahaziah fell through the lattice in his upper chamber in Samaria, and lay sick; so he sent messengers, telling them, “Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this sickness.” 
2KI.1.3	But the angel of the 
2KI.1.4	Now therefore thus says the 
2KI.1.5	The messengers returned to the king, and he said to them, “Why have you returned?” 
2KI.1.6	And they said to him, “There came a man to meet us, and said to us, ‘Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, Thus says the 
2KI.1.7	He said to them, “What kind of man was he who came to meet you and told you these things?” 
2KI.1.8	They answered him, “He wore a garment of haircloth, with a girdle of leather about his loins.” And he said, “It is Elijah the Tishbite.”
2KI.1.9	Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty men with his fifty. He went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, “O man of God, the king says, ‘Come down.’ ” 
2KI.1.10	 But Elijah answered the captain of fifty, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty.” Then fire came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
2KI.1.11	Again the king sent to him another captain of fifty men with his fifty. And he went up
2KI.1.12	But Elijah answered them, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty.” Then the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.
2KI.1.13	Again the king sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and entreated him, “O man of God, I pray you, let my life, and the life of these fifty servants of yours, be precious in your sight. 
2KI.1.14	Lo, fire came down from heaven, and consumed the two former captains of fifty men with their fifties; but now let my life be precious in your sight.” 
2KI.1.15	Then the angel of the 
2KI.1.16	and said to him, “Thus says the 
2KI.1.17	So he died according to the word of the 
2KI.1.18	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2KI.2.1	Now when the 
2KI.2.2	And Elijah said to Elisha, “Tarry here, I pray you; for the 
2KI.2.3	And the sons of the prophets who were in Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that today the 
2KI.2.4	Elijah said to him, “Elisha, tarry here, I pray you; for the 
2KI.2.5	The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho drew near to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that today the 
2KI.2.6	Then Elijah said to him, “Tarry here, I pray you; for the 
2KI.2.7	Fifty men of the sons of the prophets also went, and stood at some distance from them, as they both were standing by the Jordan. 
2KI.2.8	Then Elijah took his mantle, and rolled it up, and struck the water, and the water was parted to the one side and to the other, till the two of them could go over on dry ground.
2KI.2.9	When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you.” And Elisha said, “I pray you, let me inherit a double share of your spirit.” 
2KI.2.10	And he said, “You have asked a hard thing; yet, if you see me as I am being taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if you do not see me, it shall not be so.” 
2KI.2.11	 And as they still went on and talked, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them. And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. 
2KI.2.12	And Elisha saw it and he cried, “My father, my father! the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!” And he saw him no more.
2KI.2.12	Then he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces. 
2KI.2.13	And he took up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. 
2KI.2.14	Then he took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and struck the water, saying, “Where is the 
2KI.2.15	Now when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho saw him over against them, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” And they came to meet him, and bowed to the ground before him. 
2KI.2.16	And they said to him, “Behold now, there are with your servants fifty strong men; pray, let them go, and seek your master; it may be that the Spirit of the 
2KI.2.17	But when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, “Send.” They sent therefore fifty men; and for three days they sought him but did not find him. 
2KI.2.18	And they came back to him, while he tarried at Jericho, and he said to them, “Did I not say to you, Do not go?”
2KI.2.19	Now the men of the city said to Elisha, “Behold, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land is unfruitful.” 
2KI.2.20	He said, “Bring me a new bowl, and put salt in it.” So they brought it to him. 
2KI.2.21	Then he went to the spring of water and threw salt in it, and said, “Thus says the 
2KI.2.22	So the water has been wholesome to this day, according to the word which Elisha spoke.
2KI.2.23	He went up from there to Bethel; and while he was going up on the way, some small boys came out of the city and jeered at him, saying, “Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!” 
2KI.2.24	And he turned around, and when he saw them, he cursed them in the name of the 
2KI.2.25	From there he went on to Mount Carmel, and thence he returned to Samaria.
2KI.3.1	In the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned twelve years. 
2KI.3.2	He did what was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.3.3	Nevertheless he clung to the sin of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin; he did not depart from it.
2KI.3.4	Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder; and he had to deliver annually
2KI.3.5	But when Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. 
2KI.3.6	So King Jehoram marched out of Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel. 
2KI.3.7	And he went and sent word to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “The king of Moab has rebelled against me; will you go with me to battle against Moab?” And he said, “I will go; I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.” 
2KI.3.8	Then he said, “By which way shall we march?” Jehoram answered, “By the way of the wilderness of Edom.”
2KI.3.9	So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. And when they had made a circuitous march of seven days, there was no water for the army or for the beasts which followed them. 
2KI.3.10	Then the king of Israel said, “Alas! The 
2KI.3.11	And Jehoshaphat said, “Is there no prophet of the 
2KI.3.12	And Jehoshaphat said, “The word of the 
2KI.3.13	And Elisha said to the king of Israel, “What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother.” But the king of Israel said to him, “No; it is the 
2KI.3.14	And Elisha said, “As the 
2KI.3.15	But now bring me a minstrel.” And when the minstrel played, the power of the 
2KI.3.16	And he said, “Thus says the 
2KI.3.17	For thus says the 
2KI.3.18	This is a light thing in the sight of the 
2KI.3.19	and you shall conquer every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop up all springs of water, and ruin every good piece of land with stones.” 
2KI.3.20	The next morning, about the time of offering the sacrifice, behold, water came from the direction of Edom, till the country was filled with water.
2KI.3.21	When all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, all who were able to put on armor, from the youngest to the oldest, were called out, and were drawn up at the frontier. 
2KI.3.22	And when they rose early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, the Moabites saw the water opposite them as red as blood. 
2KI.3.23	And they said, “This is blood; the kings have surely fought together, and slain one another. Now then, Moab, to the spoil!” 
2KI.3.24	But when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose and attacked the Moabites, till they fled before them; and they went forward, slaughtering the Moabites as they went.
2KI.3.25	And they overthrew the cities, and on every good piece of land every man threw a stone, until it was covered; they stopped every spring of water, and felled all the good trees; till only its stones were left in Kir-hareseth, and the slingers surrounded and conquered it. 
2KI.3.26	When the king of Moab saw that the battle was going against him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through, opposite the king of Edom; but they could not. 
2KI.3.27	Then he took his eldest son who was to reign in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there came great wrath upon Israel; and they withdrew from him and returned to their own land.
2KI.4.1	Now the wife of one of the sons of the prophets cried to Elisha, “Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant feared the 
2KI.4.2	And Elisha said to her, “What shall I do for you? Tell me; what have you in the house?” And she said, “Your maidservant has nothing in the house, except a jar of oil.” 
2KI.4.3	Then he said, “Go outside, borrow vessels of all your neighbors, empty vessels and not too few. 
2KI.4.4	Then go in, and shut the door upon yourself and your sons, and pour into all these vessels; and when one is full, set it aside.” 
2KI.4.5	So she went from him and shut the door upon herself and her sons; and as she poured they brought the vessels to her. 
2KI.4.6	When the vessels were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another vessel.” And he said to her, “There is not another.” Then the oil stopped flowing. 
2KI.4.7	She came and told the man of God, and he said, “Go, sell the oil and pay your debts, and you and your sons can live on the rest.”
2KI.4.8	One day Elisha went on to Shunem, where a wealthy woman lived, who urged him to eat some food. So whenever he passed that way, he would turn in there to eat food. 
2KI.4.9	And she said to her husband, “Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, who is continually passing our way. 
2KI.4.10	Let us make a small roof chamber with walls, and put there for him a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp, so that whenever he comes to us, he can go in there.”
2KI.4.11	One day he came there, and he turned into the chamber and rested there. 
2KI.4.12	And he said to Gehazi his servant, “Call this Shunammite.” When he had called her, she stood before him. 
2KI.4.13	And he said to him, “Say now to her, See, you have taken all this trouble for us; what is to be done for you? Would you have a word spoken on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army?” She answered, “I dwell among my own people.” 
2KI.4.14	And he said, “What then is to be done for her?” Gehazi answered, “Well, she has no son, and her husband is old.” 
2KI.4.15	He said, “Call her.” And when he had called her, she stood in the doorway. 
2KI.4.16	And he said, “At this season, when the time comes round, you shall embrace a son.” And she said, “No, my lord, O man of God; do not lie to your maidservant.” 
2KI.4.17	But the woman conceived, and she bore a son about that time the following spring, as Elisha had said to her.
2KI.4.18	When the child had grown, he went out one day to his father among the reapers. 
2KI.4.19	And he said to his father, “Oh, my head, my head!” The father said to his servant, “Carry him to his mother.” 
2KI.4.20	And when he had lifted him, and brought him to his mother, the child sat on her lap till noon, and then he died. 
2KI.4.21	And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out. 
2KI.4.22	Then she called to her husband, and said, “Send me one of the servants and one of the asses, that I may quickly go to the man of God, and come back again.” 
2KI.4.23	And he said, “Why will you go to him today? It is neither new moon nor sabbath.” She said, “It will be well.” 
2KI.4.24	Then she saddled the ass, and she said to her servant, “Urge the beast on; do not slacken the pace for me unless I tell you.” 
2KI.4.25	So she set out, and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel.
2KI.4.25	When the man of God saw her coming, he said to Gehazi his servant, “Look, yonder is the Shunammite; 
2KI.4.26	run at once to meet her, and say to her, Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?” And she answered, “It is well.” 
2KI.4.27	And when she came to the mountain to the man of God, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came to thrust her away. But the man of God said, “Let her alone, for she is in bitter distress; and the 
2KI.4.28	Then she said, “Did I ask my lord for a son? Did I not say, Do not deceive me?” 
2KI.4.29	He said to Gehazi, “Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go. If you meet any one, do not salute him; and if any one salutes you, do not reply; and lay my staff upon the face of the child.” 
2KI.4.30	Then the mother of the child said, “As the 
2KI.4.31	Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff upon the face of the child, but there was no sound or sign of life. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, “The child has not awaked.”
2KI.4.32	When Elisha came into the house, he saw the child lying dead on his bed. 
2KI.4.33	 So he went in and shut the door upon the two of them, and prayed to the 
2KI.4.34	Then he went up and lay upon the child, putting his mouth upon his mouth, his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands; and as he stretched himself upon him, the flesh of the child became warm. 
2KI.4.35	Then he got up again, and walked once to and fro in the house, and went up, and stretched himself upon him; the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes. 
2KI.4.36	Then he summoned Gehazi and said, “Call this Shunammite.” So he called her. And when she came to him, he said, “Take up your son.” 
2KI.4.37	She came and fell at his feet, bowing to the ground; then she took up her son and went out.
2KI.4.38	And Elisha came again to Gilgal when there was a famine in the land. And as the sons of the prophets were sitting before him, he said to his servant, “Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.” 
2KI.4.39	One of them went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine and gathered from it his lap full of wild gourds, and came and cut them up into the pot of pottage, not knowing what they were. 
2KI.4.40	And they poured out for the men to eat. But while they were eating of the pottage, they cried out, “O man of God, there is death in the pot!” And they could not eat it. 
2KI.4.41	He said, “Then bring meal.” And he threw it into the pot, and said, “Pour out for the men, that they may eat.” And there was no harm in the pot.
2KI.4.42	A man came from Baal-shalishah, bringing the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. And Elisha said, “Give to the men, that they may eat.” 
2KI.4.43	But his servant said, “How am I to set this before a hundred men?” So he repeated, “Give them to the men, that they may eat, for thus says the 
2KI.4.44	So he set it before them. And they ate, and had some left, according to the word of the 
2KI.5.1	Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master and in high favor, because by him the 
2KI.5.2	Now the Syrians on one of their raids had carried off a little maid from the land of Israel, and she waited on Naaman's wife. 
2KI.5.3	She said to her mistress, “Would that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy.” 
2KI.5.4	So Naaman went in and told his lord, “Thus and so spoke the maiden from the land of Israel.” 
2KI.5.5	And the king of Syria said, “Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.”
2KI.5.5	So he went, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten festal garments. 
2KI.5.6	And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, which read, “When this letter reaches you, know that I have sent to you Naaman my servant, that you may cure him of his leprosy.” 
2KI.5.7	And when the king of Israel read the letter, he rent his clothes and said, “Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends word to me to cure a man of his leprosy? Only consider, and see how he is seeking a quarrel with me.”
2KI.5.8	But when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, he sent to the king, saying, “Why have you rent your clothes? Let him come now to me, that he may know that there is a prophet in Israel.” 
2KI.5.9	So Naaman came with his horses and chariots, and halted at the door of Elisha's house. 
2KI.5.10	And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored, and you shall be clean.” 
2KI.5.11	But Naaman was angry, and went away, saying, “Behold, I thought that he would surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the 
2KI.5.12	Are not Abana
2KI.5.13	But his servants came near and said to him, “My father, if the prophet had commanded you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much rather, then, when he says to you, ‘Wash, and be clean’?” 
2KI.5.14	So he went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
2KI.5.15	Then he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and he came and stood before him; and he said, “Behold, I know that there is no God in all the earth but in Israel; so accept now a present from your servant.” 
2KI.5.16	But he said, “As the 
2KI.5.17	Then Naaman said, “If not, I pray you, let there be given to your servant two mules' burden of earth; for henceforth your servant will not offer burnt offering or sacrifice to any god but the 
2KI.5.18	In this matter may the 
2KI.5.19	He said to him, “Go in peace.”
2KI.5.19	But when Naaman had gone from him a short distance, 
2KI.5.20	Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, “See, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not accepting from his hand what he brought. As the 
2KI.5.21	So Gehazi followed Naaman. And when Naaman saw some one running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him, and said, “Is all well?” 
2KI.5.22	And he said, “All is well. My master has sent me to say, ‘There have just now come to me from the hill country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; pray, give them a talent of silver and two festal garments.’ ” 
2KI.5.23	And Naaman said, “Be pleased to accept two talents.” And he urged him, and tied up two talents of silver in two bags, with two festal garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they carried them before Gehazi. 
2KI.5.24	And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and put them in the house; and he sent the men away, and they departed. 
2KI.5.25	He went in, and stood before his master, and Elisha said to him, “Where have you been, Gehazi?” And he said, “Your servant went nowhere.” 
2KI.5.26	But he said to him, “Did I not go with you in spirit when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Was it a time to accept money and garments, olive orchards and vineyards, sheep and oxen, menservants and maidservants? 
2KI.5.27	Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cleave to you, and to your descendants for ever.” So he went out from his presence a leper, as white as snow.
2KI.6.1	Now the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “See, the place where we dwell under your charge is too small for us. 
2KI.6.2	Let us go to the Jordan and each of us get there a log, and let us make a place for us to dwell there.” And he answered, “Go.” 
2KI.6.3	Then one of them said, “Be pleased to go with your servants.” And he answered, “I will go.” 
2KI.6.4	So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees. 
2KI.6.5	But as one was felling a log, his axe head fell into the water; and he cried out, “Alas, my master! It was borrowed.” 
2KI.6.6	Then the man of God said, “Where did it fall?” When he showed him the place, he cut off a stick, and threw it in there, and made the iron float. 
2KI.6.7	And he said, “Take it up.” So he reached out his hand and took it.
2KI.6.8	Once when the king of Syria was warring against Israel, he took counsel with his servants, saying, “At such and such a place shall be my camp.” 
2KI.6.9	But the man of God sent word to the king of Israel, “Beware that you do not pass this place, for the Syrians are going down there.” 
2KI.6.10	And the king of Israel sent to the place of which the man of God told him. Thus he used to warn him, so that he saved himself there more than once or twice.
2KI.6.11	And the mind of the king of Syria was greatly troubled because of this thing; and he called his servants and said to them, “Will you not show me who of us is for the king of Israel?” 
2KI.6.12	And one of his servants said, “None, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedchamber.” 
2KI.6.13	And he said, “Go and see where he is, that I may send and seize him.” It was told him, “Behold, he is in Dothan.” 
2KI.6.14	So he sent there horses and chariots and a great army; and they came by night, and surrounded the city.
2KI.6.15	When the servant of the man of God rose early in the morning and went out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was round about the city. And the servant said, “Alas, my master! What shall we do?” 
2KI.6.16	He said, “Fear not, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.” 
2KI.6.17	Then Elisha prayed, and said, “O 
2KI.6.18	And when the Syrians came down against him, Elisha prayed to the 
2KI.6.19	And Elisha said to them, “This is not the way, and this is not the city; follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.” And he led them to Samaria.
2KI.6.20	As soon as they entered Samaria, Elisha said, “O 
2KI.6.21	When the king of Israel saw them he said to Elisha, “My father, shall I slay them? Shall I slay them?” 
2KI.6.22	He answered, “You shall not slay them. Would you slay those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master.” 
2KI.6.23	So he prepared for them a great feast; and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the Syrians came no more on raids into the land of Israel.
2KI.6.24	Afterward Ben-hadad king of Syria mustered his entire army, and went up, and besieged Samaria. 
2KI.6.25	And there was a great famine in Samaria, as they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove's dung for five shekels of silver. 
2KI.6.26	Now as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, “Help, my lord, O king!” 
2KI.6.27	And he said, “If the 
2KI.6.28	And the king asked her, “What is your trouble?” She answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.’ 
2KI.6.29	So we boiled my son, and ate him. And on the next day I said to her, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him’; but she has hidden her son.” 
2KI.6.30	When the king heard the words of the woman he rent his clothes—now he was passing by upon the wall—and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth beneath upon his body— 
2KI.6.31	and he said, “May God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders today.”
2KI.6.32	Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. Now the king had dispatched a man from his presence; but before the messenger arrived Elisha said to the elders, “Do you see how this murderer has sent to take off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold the door fast against him. Is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?” 
2KI.6.33	And while he was still speaking with them, the king
2KI.7.1	But Elisha said, “Hear the word of the 
2KI.7.2	Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned said to the man of God, “If the 
2KI.7.3	Now there were four men who were lepers at the entrance to the gate; and they said to one another, “Why do we sit here till we die? 
2KI.7.4	If we say, ‘Let us enter the city,’ the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; and if we sit here, we die also. So now come, let us go over to the camp of the Syrians; if they spare our lives we shall live, and if they kill us we shall but die.” 
2KI.7.5	So they arose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians; but when they came to the edge of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no one there. 
2KI.7.6	For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians hear the sound of chariots, and of horses, the sound of a great army, so that they said to one another, “Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to come upon us.” 
2KI.7.7	So they fled away in the twilight and forsook their tents, their horses, and their asses, leaving the camp as it was, and fled for their lives. 
2KI.7.8	And when these lepers came to the edge of the camp, they went into a tent, and ate and drank, and they carried off silver and gold and clothing, and went and hid them; then they came back, and entered another tent, and carried off things from it, and went and hid them.
2KI.7.9	Then they said to one another, “We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news; if we are silent and wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us; now therefore come, let us go and tell the king's household.” 
2KI.7.10	So they came and called to the gatekeepers of the city, and told them, “We came to the camp of the Syrians, and behold, there was no one to be seen or heard there, nothing but the horses tied, and the asses tied, and the tents as they were.” 
2KI.7.11	Then the gatekeepers called out, and it was told within the king's household. 
2KI.7.12	And the king rose in the night, and said to his servants, “I will tell you what the Syrians have prepared against us. They know that we are hungry; therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the open country, thinking, ‘When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive and get into the city.’ ” 
2KI.7.13	And one of his servants said, “Let some men take five of the remaining horses, seeing that those who are left here will fare like the whole multitude of Israel that have already perished; let us send and see.” 
2KI.7.14	So they took two mounted men, and the king sent them after the army of the Syrians, saying, “Go and see.” 
2KI.7.15	So they went after them as far as the Jordan; and lo, all the way was littered with garments and equipment which the Syrians had thrown away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.
2KI.7.16	Then the people went out, and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a measure of fine meal was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the 
2KI.7.17	Now the king had appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate; and the people trod upon him in the gate, so that he died, as the man of God had said when the king came down to him. 
2KI.7.18	For when the man of God had said to the king, “Two measures of barley shall be sold for a shekel, and a measure of fine meal for a shekel, about this time tomorrow in the gate of Samaria,” 
2KI.7.19	the captain had answered the man of God, “If the 
2KI.7.20	And so it happened to him, for the people trod upon him in the gate and he died.
2KI.8.1	Now Elisha had said to the woman whose son he had restored to life, “Arise, and depart with your household, and sojourn wherever you can; for the 
2KI.8.2	So the woman arose, and did according to the word of the man of God; she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years. 
2KI.8.3	And at the end of the seven years, when the woman returned from the land of the Philistines, she went forth to appeal to the king for her house and her land. 
2KI.8.4	Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, “Tell me all the great things that Elisha has done.” 
2KI.8.5	And while he was telling the king how Elisha had restored the dead to life, behold, the woman whose son he had restored to life appealed to the king for her house and her land. And Gehazi said, “My lord, O king, here is the woman, and here is her son whom Elisha restored to life.” 
2KI.8.6	And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed an official for her, saying, “Restore all that was hers, together with all the produce of the fields from the day that she left the land until now.”
2KI.8.7	Now Elisha came to Damascus. Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick; and when it was told him, “The man of God has come here,” 
2KI.8.8	the king said to Hazael, “Take a present with you and go to meet the man of God, and inquire of the 
2KI.8.9	So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, all kinds of goods of Damascus, forty camel loads. When he came and stood before him, he said, “Your son Ben-hadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, ‘Shall I recover from this sickness?’ ” 
2KI.8.10	And Elisha said to him, “Go, say to him, ‘You shall certainly recover’; but the 
2KI.8.11	And he fixed his gaze and stared at him, until he was ashamed. And the man of God wept. 
2KI.8.12	And Hazael said, “Why does my lord weep?” He answered, “Because I know the evil that you will do to the people of Israel; you will set on fire their fortresses, and you will slay their young men with the sword, and dash in pieces their little ones, and rip up their women with child.” 
2KI.8.13	And Hazael said, “What is your servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing?” Elisha answered, “The 
2KI.8.14	Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, “What did Elisha say to you?” And he answered, “He told me that you would certainly recover.” 
2KI.8.15	But on the morrow he took the coverlet and dipped it in water and spread it over his face, till he died. And Hazael became king in his stead.
2KI.8.16	In the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel,
2KI.8.17	 He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 
2KI.8.18	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife. And he did what was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.8.19	Yet the 
2KI.8.20	In his days Edom revolted from the rule of Judah, and set up a king of their own. 
2KI.8.21	Then Joram passed over to Zair with all his chariots, and rose by night, and he and his chariot commanders smote the Edomites who had surrounded him; but his army fled home. 
2KI.8.22	So Edom revolted from the rule of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time. 
2KI.8.23	Now the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.8.24	 So Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.8.25	In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, began to reign. 
2KI.8.26	Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah; she was a granddaughter of Omri king of Israel. 
2KI.8.27	He also walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did what was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.8.28	He went with Joram the son of Ahab to make war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead, where the Syrians wounded Joram. 
2KI.8.29	And King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
2KI.9.2	And when you arrive, look there for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi; and go in and bid him rise from among his fellows, and lead him to an inner chamber. 
2KI.9.3	Then take the flask of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, ‘Thus says the 
2KI.9.4	So the young man, the prophet,
2KI.9.5	And when he came, behold, the commanders of the army were in council; and he said, “I have an errand to you, O commander.” And Jehu said, “To which of us all?” And he said, “To you, O commander.” 
2KI.9.6	So he arose, and went into the house; and the young man poured the oil on his head, saying to him, “Thus says the 
2KI.9.7	And you shall strike down the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge on Jezebel the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the 
2KI.9.8	For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and I will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel. 
2KI.9.9	And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah. 
2KI.9.10	And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel, and none shall bury her.” Then he opened the door, and fled.
2KI.9.11	When Jehu came out to the servants of his master, they said to him, “Is all well? Why did this mad fellow come to you?” And he said to them, “You know the fellow and his talk.” 
2KI.9.12	And they said, “That is not true; tell us now.” And he said, “Thus and so he spoke to me, saying, ‘Thus says the 
2KI.9.13	Then in haste every man of them took his garment, and put it under him on the bare
2KI.9.14	Thus Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram with all Israel had been on guard at Ramoth-gilead against Hazael king of Syria; 
2KI.9.15	but King Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) So Jehu said, “If this is your mind, then let no one slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreel.” 
2KI.9.16	Then Jehu mounted his chariot, and went to Jezreel, for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to visit Joram.
2KI.9.17	Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, “I see a company.” And Joram said, “Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, ‘Is it peace?’ ” 
2KI.9.18	So a man on horseback went to meet him, and said, “Thus says the king, ‘Is it peace?’ ” And Jehu said, “What have you to do with peace? Turn round and ride behind me.” And the watchman reported, saying, “The messenger reached them, but he is not coming back.” 
2KI.9.19	Then he sent out a second horseman, who came to them, and said, “Thus the king has said, ‘Is it peace?’ ” And Jehu answered, “What have you to do with peace? Turn round and ride behind me.” 
2KI.9.20	Again the watchman reported, “He reached them, but he is not coming back. And the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he drives furiously.”
2KI.9.21	Joram said, “Make ready.” And they made ready his chariot. Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah set out, each in his chariot, and went to meet Jehu, and met him at the property of Naboth the Jezreelite. 
2KI.9.22	And when Joram saw Jehu, he said, “Is it peace, Jehu?” He answered, “What peace can there be, so long as the harlotries and the sorceries of your mother Jezebel are so many?” 
2KI.9.23	Then Joram reined about and fled, saying to Ahaziah, “Treachery, O Ahaziah!” 
2KI.9.24	And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and shot Joram between the shoulders, so that the arrow pierced his heart, and he sank in his chariot. 
2KI.9.25	 Jehu said to Bidkar his aide, “Take him up, and cast him on the plot of ground belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember, when you and I rode side by side behind Ahab his father, how the 
2KI.9.26	‘As surely as I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons—says the 
2KI.9.27	When Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled in the direction of Beth-haggan. And Jehu pursued him, and said, “Shoot him also”; and they shot him
2KI.9.28	His servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the city of David.
2KI.9.29	In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah began to reign over Judah.
2KI.9.30	When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and adorned her head, and looked out of the window. 
2KI.9.31	And as Jehu entered the gate, she said, “Is it peace, you Zimri, murderer of your master?” 
2KI.9.32	And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, “Who is on my side? Who?” Two or three eunuchs looked out at him. 
2KI.9.33	He said, “Throw her down.” So they threw her down; and some of her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses, and they trampled on her. 
2KI.9.34	Then he went in and ate and drank; and he said, “See now to this cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a king's daughter.” 
2KI.9.35	But when they went to bury her, they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands. 
2KI.9.36	 When they came back and told him, he said, “This is the word of the 
2KI.9.37	and the corpse of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the territory of Jezreel, so that no one can say, This is Jezebel.’ ”
2KI.10.1	Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters, and sent them to Samaria, to the rulers of the city,
2KI.10.2	“Now then, as soon as this letter comes to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, fortified cities also, and weapons, 
2KI.10.3	select the best and fittest of your master's sons and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.” 
2KI.10.4	But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, “Behold, the two kings could not stand before him; how then can we stand?” 
2KI.10.5	So he who was over the palace, and he who was over the city, together with the elders and the guardians, sent to Jehu, saying, “We are your servants, and we will do all that you bid us. We will not make any one king; do whatever is good in your eyes.” 
2KI.10.6	Then he wrote to them a second letter, saying, “If you are on my side, and if you are ready to obey me, take the heads of your master's sons, and come to me at Jezreel tomorrow at this time.” Now the king's sons, seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who were bringing them up. 
2KI.10.7	And when the letter came to them, they took the king's sons, and slew them, seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him at Jezreel. 
2KI.10.8	When the messenger came and told him, “They have brought the heads of the king's sons,” he said, “Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.” 
2KI.10.9	Then in the morning, when he went out, he stood, and said to all the people, “You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master, and slew him; but who struck down all these? 
2KI.10.10	Know then that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of the 
2KI.10.11	So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, all his great men, and his familiar friends, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.
2KI.10.12	Then he set out and went to Samaria. On the way, when he was at Beth-eked of the Shepherds, 
2KI.10.13	Jehu met the kinsmen of Ahaziah king of Judah, and he said, “Who are you?” And they answered, “We are the kinsmen of Ahaziah, and we came down to visit the royal princes and the sons of the queen mother.” 
2KI.10.14	He said, “Take them alive.” And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of Beth-eked, forty-two persons, and he spared none of them.
2KI.10.15	And when he departed from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him; and he greeted him, and said to him, “Is your heart true to my heart as mine is to yours?”
2KI.10.16	And he said, “Come with me, and see my zeal for the 
2KI.10.17	And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained to Ahab in Samaria, till he had wiped them out, according to the word of the 
2KI.10.18	Then Jehu assembled all the people, and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him much. 
2KI.10.19	Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshipers and all his priests; let none be missing, for I have a great sacrifice to offer to Baal; whoever is missing shall not live.” But Jehu did it with cunning in order to destroy the worshipers of Baal. 
2KI.10.20	And Jehu ordered, “Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal.” So they proclaimed it. 
2KI.10.21	And Jehu sent throughout all Israel; and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left who did not come. And they entered the house of Baal, and the house of Baal was filled from one end to the other. 
2KI.10.22	He said to him who was in charge of the wardrobe, “Bring out the vestments for all the worshipers of Baal.” So he brought out the vestments for them. 
2KI.10.23	Then Jehu went into the house of Baal with Jehonadab the son of Rechab; and he said to the worshipers of Baal, “Search, and see that there is no servant of the 
2KI.10.24	Then he
2KI.10.24	Now Jehu had stationed eighty men outside, and said, “The man who allows any of those whom I give into your hands to escape shall forfeit his life.” 
2KI.10.25	So as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guard and to the officers, “Go in and slay them; let not a man escape.” So when they put them to the sword, the guard and the officers cast them out and went into the inner room
2KI.10.26	and they brought out the pillar that was in the house of Baal, and burned it. 
2KI.10.27	And they demolished the pillar of Baal, and demolished the house of Baal, and made it a latrine to this day.
2KI.10.28	Thus Jehu wiped out Baal from Israel. 
2KI.10.29	But Jehu did not turn aside from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and in Dan. 
2KI.10.30	And the 
2KI.10.31	But Jehu was not careful to walk in the law of the 
2KI.10.32	In those days the 
2KI.10.33	from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, that is, Gilead and Bashan. 
2KI.10.34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
2KI.10.35	So Jehu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead. 
2KI.10.36	The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.
2KI.11.2	But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king's sons who were about to be slain, and she put
2KI.11.3	and he remained with her six years, hid in the house of the 
2KI.11.4	But in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and brought the captains of the Carites and of the guards, and had them come to him in the house of the 
2KI.11.5	And he commanded them, “This is the thing that you shall do: one third of you, those who come off duty on the sabbath and guard the king's house 
2KI.11.6	(another third being at the gate Sur and a third at the gate behind the guards), shall guard the palace; 
2KI.11.7	and the two divisions of you, which come on duty in force on the sabbath and guard the house of the 
2KI.11.8	shall surround the king, each with his weapons in his hand; and whoever approaches the ranks is to be slain. Be with the king when he goes out and when he comes in.”
2KI.11.9	The captains did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded, and each brought his men who were to go off duty on the sabbath, with those who were to come on duty on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest. 
2KI.11.10	And the priest delivered to the captains the spears and shields that had been King David's, which were in the house of the 
2KI.11.11	and the guards stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the south side of the house to the north side of the house, around the altar and the house.
2KI.11.12	Then he brought out the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony; and they proclaimed him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, “Long live the king!”
2KI.11.13	When Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she went into the house of the 
2KI.11.14	and when she looked, there was the king standing by the pillar, according to the custom, and the captains and the trumpeters beside the king, and all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets. And Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, “Treason! Treason!” 
2KI.11.15	Then Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains who were set over the army, “Bring her out between the ranks; and slay with the sword any one who follows her.” For the priest said, “Let her not be slain in the house of the 
2KI.11.16	So they laid hands on her; and she went through the horses' entrance to the king's house, and there she was slain.
2KI.11.17	And Jehoiada made a covenant between the 
2KI.11.18	Then all the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and tore it down; his altars and his images they broke in pieces, and they slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest posted watchmen over the house of the 
2KI.11.19	And he took the captains, the Carites, the guards, and all the people of the land; and they brought the king down from the house of the 
2KI.11.20	So all the people of the land rejoiced; and the city was quiet after Athaliah had been slain with the sword at the king's house.
2KI.12.1	In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba. 
2KI.12.2	And Jehoash did what was right in the eyes of the 
2KI.12.3	Nevertheless the high places were not taken away; the people continued to sacrifice and burn incense on the high places.
2KI.12.4	Jehoash said to the priests, “All the money of the holy things which is brought into the house of the 
2KI.12.5	let the priests take, each from his acquaintance; and let them repair the house wherever any need of repairs is discovered.” 
2KI.12.6	But by the twenty-third year of King Jehoash the priests had made no repairs on the house. 
2KI.12.7	Therefore King Jehoash summoned Jehoiada the priest and the other priests and said to them, “Why are you not repairing the house? Now therefore take no more money from your acquaintances, but hand it over for the repair of the house.” 
2KI.12.8	So the priests agreed that they should take no more money from the people, and that they should not repair the house.
2KI.12.9	Then Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar on the right side as one entered the house of the 
2KI.12.10	And whenever they saw that there was much money in the chest, the king's secretary and the high priest came up and they counted and tied up in bags the money that was found in the house of the 
2KI.12.11	Then they would give the money that was weighed out into the hands of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of the 
2KI.12.12	and to the masons and the stonecutters, as well as to buy timber and quarried stone for making repairs on the house of the 
2KI.12.13	But there were not made for the house of the 
2KI.12.14	for that was given to the workmen who were repairing the house of the 
2KI.12.15	And they did not ask an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to pay out to the workmen, for they dealt honestly. 
2KI.12.16	The money from the guilt offerings and the money from the sin offerings was not brought into the house of the 
2KI.12.18	Jehoash king of Judah took all the votive gifts that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah his fathers, the kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own votive gifts, and all the gold that was found in the treasuries of the house of the 
2KI.12.19	Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.12.20	His servants arose and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in the house of Millo, on the way that goes down to Silla. 
2KI.12.21	It was Jozacar the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, who struck him down, so that he died. And they buried him with his fathers in the city of David, and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.13.1	In the twenty-third year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned seventeen years. 
2KI.13.2	He did what was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.13.3	And the anger of the 
2KI.13.4	Then Jehoahaz besought the 
2KI.13.5	(Therefore the 
2KI.13.6	Nevertheless they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, which he made Israel to sin, but walked
2KI.13.7	For there was not left to Jehoahaz an army of more than fifty horsemen and ten chariots and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them and made them like the dust at threshing. 
2KI.13.8	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
2KI.13.9	So Jehoahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria; and Joash his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.13.10	In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned sixteen years. 
2KI.13.11	He also did what was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.13.12	Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and the might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
2KI.13.13	So Joash slept with his fathers, and Jeroboam sat upon his throne; and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
2KI.13.14	Now when Elisha had fallen sick with the illness of which he was to die, Joash king of Israel went down to him, and wept before him, crying, “My father, my father! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!” 
2KI.13.15	And Elisha said to him, “Take a bow and arrows”; so he took a bow and arrows. 
2KI.13.16	Then he said to the king of Israel, “Draw the bow”; and he drew it. And Elisha laid his hands upon the king's hands. 
2KI.13.17	And he said, “Open the window eastward”; and he opened it. Then Elisha said, “Shoot”; and he shot. And he said, “The 
2KI.13.18	And he said, “Take the arrows”; and he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, “Strike the ground with them”; and he struck three times, and stopped. 
2KI.13.19	Then the man of God was angry with him, and said, “You should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck down Syria until you had made an end of it, but now you will strike down Syria only three times.”
2KI.13.20	So Elisha died, and they buried him. Now bands of Moabites used to invade the land in the spring of the year. 
2KI.13.21	And as a man was being buried, lo, a marauding band was seen and the man was cast into the grave of Elisha; and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood on his feet.
2KI.13.22	Now Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz. 
2KI.13.23	But the 
2KI.13.24	When Hazael king of Syria died, Ben-hadad his son became king in his stead. 
2KI.13.25	Then Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again from Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken from Jehoahaz his father in war. Three times Joash defeated him and recovered the cities of Israel.
2KI.14.1	In the second year of Joash the son of Joahaz, king of Israel, Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, began to reign. 
2KI.14.2	 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jeho-addin of Jerusalem. 
2KI.14.3	And he did what was right in the eyes of the 
2KI.14.4	But the high places were not removed; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. 
2KI.14.5	And as soon as the royal power was firmly in his hand he killed his servants who had slain the king his father. 
2KI.14.6	But he did not put to death the children of the murderers; according to what is written in the book of the law of Moses, where the 
2KI.14.9	And Jehoash king of Israel sent word to Amaziah king of Judah, “A thistle on Lebanon sent to a cedar on Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son for a wife’; and a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thistle. 
2KI.14.10	You have indeed smitten Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Be content with your glory, and stay at home; for why should you provoke trouble so that you fall, you and Judah with you?”
2KI.14.11	But Amaziah would not listen. So Jehoash king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another in battle at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah. 
2KI.14.12	And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his home. 
2KI.14.13	And Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash, son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem for four hundred cubits, from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate. 
2KI.14.14	And he seized all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the 
2KI.14.15	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
2KI.14.16	And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.14.18	Now the rest of the deeds of Amaziah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.14.19	And they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there. 
2KI.14.20	And they brought him upon horses; and he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David. 
2KI.14.21	 And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah. 
2KI.14.22	He built Elath and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers.
2KI.14.23	In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel, began to reign in Samaria, and he reigned forty-one years. 
2KI.14.24	And he did what was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.14.25	He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath as far as the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the 
2KI.14.26	For the 
2KI.14.27	But the 
2KI.14.28	Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he fought, and how he recovered for Israel Damascus and Hamath, which had belonged to Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
2KI.14.29	And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, the kings of Israel, and Zechariah his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.15.1	In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel Azariah the son of Amaziah, king of Judah, began to reign. 
2KI.15.2	 He was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. 
2KI.15.3	And he did what was right in the eyes of the 
2KI.15.4	Nevertheless the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. 
2KI.15.5	 And the 
2KI.15.6	Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.15.7	And Azariah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David, and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.15.8	In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king of Judah Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reigned over Israel in Samaria six months. 
2KI.15.9	And he did what was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.15.10	Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and struck him down at Ibleam,
2KI.15.11	Now the rest of the deeds of Zechariah, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 
2KI.15.12	(This was the promise of the 
2KI.15.13	Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah, and he reigned one month in Samaria. 
2KI.15.14	Then Menahem the son of Gadi came up from Tirzah and came to Samaria, and he struck down Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria and slew him, and reigned in his stead. 
2KI.15.15	Now the rest of the deeds of Shallum, and the conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 
2KI.15.16	At that time Menahem sacked Tappuah
2KI.15.17	In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah Menahem the son of Gadi began to reign over Israel, and he reigned ten years in Samaria. 
2KI.15.18	And he did what was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.15.19	Pul the king of Assyria came against the land; and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that he might help him to confirm his hold of the royal power. 
2KI.15.20	Menahem exacted the money from Israel, that is, from all the wealthy men, fifty shekels of silver from every man, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and did not stay there in the land. 
2KI.15.21	Now the rest of the deeds of Menahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 
2KI.15.22	And Menahem slept with his fathers, and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.15.23	In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned two years. 
2KI.15.24	And he did what was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.15.25	And Pekah the son of Remaliah, his captain, conspired against him with fifty men of the Gileadites, and slew him in Samaria, in the citadel of the king's house;
2KI.15.26	Now the rest of the deeds of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
2KI.15.27	In the fifty-second year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned twenty years. 
2KI.15.28	And he did what was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.15.29	In the days of Pekah king of Israel Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came and captured Ijon, Abel-beth-maacah, Jan-oah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali; and he carried the people captive to Assyria. 
2KI.15.30	Then Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and struck him down, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah. 
2KI.15.31	Now the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
2KI.15.32	In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, Jotham the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, began to reign. 
2KI.15.33	 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok. 
2KI.15.34	And he did what was right in the eyes of the 
2KI.15.35	Nevertheless the high places were not removed; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. He built the upper gate of the house of the 
2KI.15.36	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.15.37	In those days the 
2KI.15.38	 Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.16.1	In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, Ahaz the son of Jotham, king of Judah, began to reign. 
2KI.16.2	 Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And he did not do what was right in the eyes of the 
2KI.16.3	but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel. He even burned his son as an offering,
2KI.16.4	And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
2KI.16.5	Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to wage war on Jerusalem, and they besieged Ahaz but could not conquer him. 
2KI.16.6	At that time
2KI.16.7	So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your son. Come up, and rescue me from the hand of the king of Syria and from the hand of the king of Israel, who are attacking me.” 
2KI.16.8	Ahaz also took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the 
2KI.16.9	And the king of Assyria hearkened to him; the king of Assyria marched up against Damascus, and took it, carrying its people captive to Kir, and he killed Rezin.
2KI.16.10	When King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, he saw the altar that was at Damascus. And King Ahaz sent to Uriah the priest a model of the altar, and its pattern, exact in all its details. 
2KI.16.11	And Uriah the priest built the altar; in accordance with all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so Uriah the priest made it, before King Ahaz arrived from Damascus. 
2KI.16.12	And when the king came from Damascus, the king viewed the altar. Then the king drew near to the altar, and went up on it, 
2KI.16.13	and burned his burnt offering and his cereal offering, and poured his drink offering, and threw the blood of his peace offerings upon the altar. 
2KI.16.14	And the bronze altar which was before the 
2KI.16.15	And King Ahaz commanded Uriah the priest, saying, “Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening cereal offering, and the king's burnt offering, and his cereal offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their cereal offering, and their drink offering; and throw upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice; but the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by.” 
2KI.16.16	Uriah the priest did all this, as King Ahaz commanded.
2KI.16.17	And King Ahaz cut off the frames of the stands, and removed the laver from them, and he took down the sea from off the bronze oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pediment of stone. 
2KI.16.18	And the covered way for the sabbath which had been built inside the palace, and the outer entrance for the king he removed from
2KI.16.19	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.16.20	 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.17.1	In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah Hoshea the son of Elah began to reign in Samaria over Israel, and he reigned nine years. 
2KI.17.2	And he did what was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.17.3	Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his vassal, and paid him tribute. 
2KI.17.4	But the king of Assyria found treachery in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So, king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year; therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison. 
2KI.17.5	Then the king of Assyria invaded all the land and came to Samaria, and for three years he besieged it. 
2KI.17.6	In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria captured Samaria, and he carried the Israelites away to Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
2KI.17.7	And this was so, because the people of Israel had sinned against the 
2KI.17.8	and walked in the customs of the nations whom the 
2KI.17.9	And the people of Israel did secretly against the 
2KI.17.10	they set up for themselves pillars and Asherim on every high hill and under every green tree; 
2KI.17.11	and there they burned incense on all the high places, as the nations did whom the 
2KI.17.12	and they served idols, of which the 
2KI.17.13	Yet the 
2KI.17.14	But they would not listen, but were stubborn, as their fathers had been, who did not believe in the 
2KI.17.15	They despised his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and the warnings which he gave them. They went after false idols, and became false, and they followed the nations that were round about them, concerning whom the 
2KI.17.16	And they forsook all the commandments of the 
2KI.17.17	And they burned their sons and their daughters as offerings,
2KI.17.18	Therefore the 
2KI.17.19	Judah also did not keep the commandments of the 
2KI.17.20	And the 
2KI.17.21	When he had torn Israel from the house of David they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king. And Jeroboam drove Israel from following the 
2KI.17.22	The people of Israel walked in all the sins which Jeroboam did; they did not depart from them, 
2KI.17.23	until the 
2KI.17.24	And the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the people of Israel; and they took possession of Samaria, and dwelt in its cities. 
2KI.17.25	And at the beginning of their dwelling there, they did not fear the 
2KI.17.26	So the king of Assyria was told, “The nations which you have carried away and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the law of the god of the land; therefore he has sent lions among them, and behold, they are killing them, because they do not know the law of the god of the land.” 
2KI.17.27	Then the king of Assyria commanded, “Send there one of the priests whom you carried away thence; and let him
2KI.17.28	So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the 
2KI.17.29	But every nation still made gods of its own, and put them in the shrines of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in the cities in which they dwelt; 
2KI.17.30	the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima, 
2KI.17.31	and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim. 
2KI.17.32	They also feared the 
2KI.17.33	So they feared the 
2KI.17.34	To this day they do according to the former manner.
2KI.17.34	They do not fear the 
2KI.17.35	The 
2KI.17.36	but you shall fear the 
2KI.17.37	And the statutes and the ordinances and the law and the commandment which he wrote for you, you shall always be careful to do. You shall not fear other gods, 
2KI.17.38	and you shall not forget the covenant that I have made with you. You shall not fear other gods, 
2KI.17.39	but you shall fear the 
2KI.17.40	However they would not listen, but they did according to their former manner.
2KI.17.41	So these nations feared the 
2KI.18.2	He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah. 
2KI.18.3	And he did what was right in the eyes of the 
2KI.18.4	He removed the high places, and broke the pillars, and cut down the Asherah. And he broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for until those days the people of Israel had burned incense to it; it was called Nehushtan. 
2KI.18.5	He trusted in the 
2KI.18.6	For he held fast to the 
2KI.18.7	And the 
2KI.18.8	He smote the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territory, from watchtower to fortified city.
2KI.18.9	In the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah, king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it 
2KI.18.10	and at the end of three years he took it. In the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken. 
2KI.18.11	The king of Assyria carried the Israelites away to Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes, 
2KI.18.12	because they did not obey the voice of the 
2KI.18.14	And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, “I have done wrong; withdraw from me; whatever you impose on me I will bear.” And the king of Assyria required of Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. 
2KI.18.15	And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the 
2KI.18.16	At that time Hezekiah stripped the gold from the doors of the temple of the 
2KI.18.17	And the king of Assyria sent the Tartan, the Rabsaris, and the Rabshakeh with a great army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. When they arrived, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is on the highway to the Fuller's Field. 
2KI.18.18	And when they called for the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder.
2KI.18.19	And the Rabshakeh said to them, “Say to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: On what do you rest this confidence of yours? 
2KI.18.20	Do you think that mere words are strategy and power for war? On whom do you now rely, that you have rebelled against me? 
2KI.18.21	Behold, you are relying now on Egypt, that broken reed of a staff, which will pierce the hand of any man who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who rely on him. 
2KI.18.22	But if you say to me, “We rely on the 
2KI.18.23	Come now, make a wager with my master the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders upon them. 
2KI.18.24	How then can you repulse a single captain among the least of my master's servants, when you rely on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? 
2KI.18.25	Moreover, is it without the 
2KI.18.26	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, said to the Rabshakeh, “Pray, speak to your servants in the Aramaic language, for we understand it; do not speak to us in the language of Judah within the hearing of the people who are on the wall.” 
2KI.18.27	But the Rabshakeh said to them, “Has my master sent me to speak these words to your master and to you, and not to the men sitting on the wall, who are doomed with you to eat their own dung and to drink their own urine?”
2KI.18.28	Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the language of Judah: “Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria! 
2KI.18.29	Thus says the king: ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you out of my hand. 
2KI.18.30	Do not let Hezekiah make you to rely on the 
2KI.18.31	Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria: ‘Make your peace with me and come out to me; then every one of you will eat of his own vine, and every one of his own fig tree, and every one of you will drink the water of his own cistern; 
2KI.18.32	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey, that you may live, and not die. And do not listen to Hezekiah when he misleads you by saying, The 
2KI.18.33	Has any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? 
2KI.18.34	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? 
2KI.18.35	Who among all the gods of the countries have delivered their countries out of my hand, that the 
2KI.18.36	But the people were silent and answered him not a word, for the king's command was, “Do not answer him.” 
2KI.18.37	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of the Rabshakeh.
2KI.19.1	When King Hezekiah heard it, he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the 
2KI.19.2	And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and the senior priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz. 
2KI.19.3	They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of distress, of rebuke, and of disgrace; children have come to the birth, and there is no strength to bring them forth. 
2KI.19.4	It may be that the 
2KI.19.5	When the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah, 
2KI.19.6	Isaiah said to them, “Say to your master, ‘Thus says the 
2KI.19.7	Behold, I will put a spirit in him, so that he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.’ ”
2KI.19.8	The Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah; for he heard that the king had left Lachish. 
2KI.19.9	And when the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “Behold, he has set out to fight against you,” he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying, 
2KI.19.10	“Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah: ‘Do not let your God on whom you rely deceive you by promising that Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. 
2KI.19.11	Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, destroying them utterly. And shall you be delivered? 
2KI.19.12	Have the gods of the nations delivered them, the nations which my fathers destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar? 
2KI.19.13	Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, the king of Hena, or the king of Ivvah?’ ”
2KI.19.14	Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the 
2KI.19.15	And Hezekiah prayed before the 
2KI.19.16	Incline thy ear, O 
2KI.19.17	Of a truth, O 
2KI.19.18	and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore they were destroyed. 
2KI.19.19	So now, O 
2KI.19.20	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah saying, “Thus says the 
2KI.19.21	This is the word that the 
2KI.19.21	‘She despises you, she scorns you—
2KI.19.21	the virgin daughter of Zion;
2KI.19.21	she wags her head behind you—
2KI.19.21	the daughter of Jerusalem.
2KI.19.22	‘Whom have you mocked and reviled?
2KI.19.22	Against whom have you raised your voice
2KI.19.22	and haughtily lifted your eyes?
2KI.19.22	Against the Holy One of Israel!
2KI.19.23	By your messengers you have mocked the Lord,
2KI.19.23	and you have said, “With my many chariots
2KI.19.23	I have gone up the heights of the mountains,
2KI.19.23	to the far recesses of Lebanon;
2KI.19.23	I felled its tallest cedars,
2KI.19.23	its choicest cypresses;
2KI.19.23	I entered its farthest retreat,
2KI.19.23	its densest forest.
2KI.19.24	I dug wells
2KI.19.24	and drank foreign waters,
2KI.19.24	and I dried up with the sole of my foot
2KI.19.24	all the streams of Egypt.”
2KI.19.25	‘Have you not heard
2KI.19.25	that I determined it long ago?
2KI.19.25	I planned from days of old
2KI.19.25	what now I bring to pass,
2KI.19.25	that you should turn fortified cities
2KI.19.25	into heaps of ruins,
2KI.19.26	while their inhabitants, shorn of strength,
2KI.19.26	are dismayed and confounded,
2KI.19.26	and have become like plants of the field,
2KI.19.26	and like tender grass,
2KI.19.26	like grass on the housetops;
2KI.19.26	blighted before it is grown?
2KI.19.27	‘But I know your sitting down
2KI.19.27	and your going out and coming in,
2KI.19.27	and your raging against me.
2KI.19.28	Because you have raged against me
2KI.19.28	and your arrogance has come into my ears,
2KI.19.28	I will put my hook in your nose
2KI.19.28	and my bit in your mouth,
2KI.19.28	and I will turn you back on the way
2KI.19.28	by which you came.
2KI.19.29	‘And this shall be the sign for you: this year you shall eat what grows of itself, and in the second year what springs of the same; then in the third year sow, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. 
2KI.19.30	And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward; 
2KI.19.31	for out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the 
2KI.19.32	‘Therefore thus says the 
2KI.19.33	By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and he shall not come into this city, says the 
2KI.19.34	For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David.’ ”
2KI.19.35	And that night the angel of the 
2KI.19.36	Then Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went home, and dwelt at Nineveh. 
2KI.19.37	And as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, slew him with the sword, and escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.20.2	Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the 
2KI.20.3	“Remember now, O 
2KI.20.4	And before Isaiah had gone out of the middle court, the word of the 
2KI.20.5	“Turn back, and say to Hezekiah the prince of my people, Thus says the 
2KI.20.6	And I will add fifteen years to your life. I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city for my own sake and for my servant David's sake.” 
2KI.20.7	And Isaiah said, “Bring a cake of figs. And let them take and lay it on the boil, that he may recover.”
2KI.20.8	And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “What shall be the sign that the 
2KI.20.9	And Isaiah said, “This is the sign to you from the 
2KI.20.10	And Hezekiah answered, “It is an easy thing for the shadow to lengthen ten steps; rather let the shadow go back ten steps.” 
2KI.20.11	And Isaiah the prophet cried to the 
2KI.20.12	At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent envoys with letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he heard that Hezekiah had been sick. 
2KI.20.13	And Hezekiah welcomed them, and he showed them all his treasure house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, his armory, all that was found in his storehouses; there was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them. 
2KI.20.14	Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, “What did these men say? And whence did they come to you?” And Hezekiah said, “They have come from a far country, from Babylon.” 
2KI.20.15	He said, “What have they seen in your house?” And Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing in my storehouses that I did not show them.”
2KI.20.16	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the 
2KI.20.17	Behold, the days are coming, when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have stored up till this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, says the 
2KI.20.18	And some of your own sons, who are born to you, shall be taken away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.” 
2KI.20.19	Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, “The word of the 
2KI.20.20	The rest of the deeds of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool and the conduit and brought water into the city, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.20.21	And Hezekiah slept with his fathers; and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.21.2	And he did what was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.21.3	For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he erected altars for Baal, and made an Asherah, as Ahab king of Israel had done, and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served them. 
2KI.21.4	And he built altars in the house of the 
2KI.21.5	And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the 
2KI.21.6	And he burned his son as an offering, and practiced soothsaying and augury, and dealt with mediums and with wizards. He did much evil in the sight of the 
2KI.21.7	And the graven image of Asherah that he had made he set in the house of which the 
2KI.21.8	and I will not cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave to their fathers, if only they will be careful to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.” 
2KI.21.9	But they did not listen, and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than the nations had done whom the 
2KI.21.10	And the 
2KI.21.11	“Because Manasseh king of Judah has committed these abominations, and has done things more wicked than all that the Amorites did, who were before him, and has made Judah also to sin with his idols; 
2KI.21.12	therefore thus says the 
2KI.21.13	And I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down. 
2KI.21.14	And I will cast off the remnant of my heritage, and give them into the hand of their enemies, and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies, 
2KI.21.15	because they have done what is evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came out of Egypt, even to this day.”
2KI.21.16	Moreover Manasseh shed very much innocent blood, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another, besides the sin which he made Judah to sin so that they did what was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.21.17	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and the sin that he committed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.21.18	 And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his house, in the garden of Uzza; and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.21.20	And he did what was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.21.21	He walked in all the way in which his father walked, and served the idols that his father served, and worshiped them; 
2KI.21.22	he forsook the 
2KI.21.23	And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and killed the king in his house. 
2KI.21.24	But the people of the land slew all those who had conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead. 
2KI.21.25	Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.21.26	And he was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza; and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.22.2	And he did what was right in the eyes of the 
2KI.22.4	“Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may reckon the amount of the money which has been brought into the house of the 
2KI.22.5	and let it be given into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the 
2KI.22.6	that is, to the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons, as well as for buying timber and quarried stone to repair the house. 
2KI.22.7	But no accounting shall be asked from them for the money which is delivered into their hand, for they deal honestly.”
2KI.22.8	And Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the 
2KI.22.9	And Shaphan the secretary came to the king, and reported to the king, “Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the 
2KI.22.10	Then Shaphan the secretary told the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read it before the king.
2KI.22.11	And when the king heard the words of the book of the law, he rent his clothes. 
2KI.22.12	And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the secretary, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying, 
2KI.22.13	“Go, inquire of the 
2KI.22.14	So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter); and they talked with her. 
2KI.22.15	And she said to them, “Thus says the 
2KI.22.16	Thus says the 
2KI.22.17	Because they have forsaken me and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath will be kindled against this place, and it will not be quenched. 
2KI.22.18	But as to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the 
2KI.22.19	because your heart was penitent, and you humbled yourself before the 
2KI.22.20	Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place.’ ” And they brought back word to the king.
2KI.23.1	Then the king sent, and all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem were gathered to him. 
2KI.23.2	And the king went up to the house of the 
2KI.23.3	And the king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the 
2KI.23.5	And he deposed the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places at the cities of Judah and round about Jerusalem; those also who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and the moon, and the constellations, and all the host of the heavens. 
2KI.23.6	And he brought out the Asherah from the house of the 
2KI.23.7	And he broke down the houses of the male cult prostitutes which were in the house of the 
2KI.23.8	And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beer-sheba; and he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on one's left at the gate of the city. 
2KI.23.9	However, the priests of the high places did not come up to the altar of the 
2KI.23.10	And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the sons of Hinnom, that no one might burn his son or his daughter as an offering to Molech. 
2KI.23.11	And he removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun, at the entrance to the house of the 
2KI.23.12	And the altars on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the 
2KI.23.13	And the king defiled the high places that were east of Jerusalem, to the south of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. 
2KI.23.14	And he broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim, and filled their places with the bones of men.
2KI.23.15	Moreover the altar at Bethel, the high place erected by Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, that altar with the high place he pulled down and he broke in pieces its stones,
2KI.23.16	And as Josiah turned, he saw the tombs there on the mount; and he sent and took the bones out of the tombs, and burned them upon the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of the 
2KI.23.17	Then he said, “What is yonder monument that I see?” And the men of the city told him, “It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and predicted these things which you have done against the altar at Bethel.” 
2KI.23.18	And he said, “Let him be; let no man move his bones.” So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet who came out of Samaria. 
2KI.23.19	And all the shrines also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which kings of Israel had made, provoking the 
2KI.23.20	And he slew all the priests of the high places who were there, upon the altars, and burned the bones of men upon them. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
2KI.23.22	For no such passover had been kept since the days of the judges who judged Israel, or during all the days of the kings of Israel or of the kings of Judah; 
2KI.23.23	but in the eighteenth year of King Josiah this passover was kept to the 
2KI.23.24	Moreover Josiah put away the mediums and the wizards and the teraphim and the idols and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, that he might establish the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the 
2KI.23.25	Before him there was no king like him, who turned to the 
2KI.23.26	Still the 
2KI.23.27	And the 
2KI.23.28	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.23.29	In his days Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt went up to the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates. King Josiah went to meet him; and Pharaoh Neco slew him at Megiddo, when he saw him. 
2KI.23.30	 And his servants carried him dead in a chariot from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.
2KI.23.31	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
2KI.23.32	And he did what was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.23.33	And Pharaoh Neco put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem, and laid upon the land a tribute of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold. 
2KI.23.34	And Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the place of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. But he took Jehoahaz away; and he came to Egypt, and died there. 
2KI.23.35	And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh, but he taxed the land to give the money according to the command of Pharaoh. He exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, from every one according to his assessment, to give it to Pharaoh Neco.
2KI.23.37	And he did what was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.24.1	In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years; then he turned and rebelled against him. 
2KI.24.2	And the 
2KI.24.3	Surely this came upon Judah at the command of the 
2KI.24.4	and also for the innocent blood that he had shed; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the 
2KI.24.5	Now the rest of the deeds of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 
2KI.24.6	So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers, and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead. 
2KI.24.7	And the king of Egypt did not come again out of his land, for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the Brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates.
2KI.24.9	And he did what was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.24.10	At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged. 
2KI.24.11	And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to the city, while his servants were besieging it; 
2KI.24.12	and Jehoiachin the king of Judah gave himself up to the king of Babylon, himself, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his palace officials. The king of Babylon took him prisoner in the eighth year of his reign, 
2KI.24.13	and carried off all the treasures of the house of the 
2KI.24.14	He carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths; none remained, except the poorest people of the land. 
2KI.24.15	And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon; the king's mother, the king's wives, his officials, and the chief men of the land, he took into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon. 
2KI.24.16	And the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon all the men of valor, seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths, one thousand, all of them strong and fit for war. 
2KI.24.17	And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin's uncle, king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.
2KI.24.19	And he did what was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.24.20	For because of the anger of the 
2KI.24.20	And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
2KI.25.1	And in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem, and laid siege to it; and they built siegeworks against it round about. 
2KI.25.2	So the city was besieged till the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. 
2KI.25.3	On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land. 
2KI.25.4	Then a breach was made in the city; the king with all the men of war fled
2KI.25.5	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him. 
2KI.25.6	Then they captured the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, who passed sentence upon him. 
2KI.25.7	They slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters, and took him to Babylon.
2KI.25.8	In the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month—which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon—Nebuzaradan, the captain of the bodyguard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. 
2KI.25.9	And he burned the house of the 
2KI.25.10	And all the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls around Jerusalem. 
2KI.25.11	And the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, together with the rest of the multitude, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried into exile. 
2KI.25.12	But the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen.
2KI.25.13	And the pillars of bronze that were in the house of the 
2KI.25.14	And they took away the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the dishes for incense and all the vessels of bronze used in the temple service, 
2KI.25.15	the firepans also, and the bowls. What was of gold the captain of the guard took away as gold, and what was of silver, as silver. 
2KI.25.16	As for the two pillars, the one sea, and the stands, which Solomon had made for the house of the 
2KI.25.17	The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and upon it was a capital of bronze; the height of the capital was three cubits; a network and pomegranates, all of bronze, were upon the capital round about. And the second pillar had the like, with the network.
2KI.25.18	And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold; 
2KI.25.19	and from the city he took an officer who had been in command of the men of war, and five men of the king's council who were found in the city; and the secretary of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the city. 
2KI.25.20	And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
2KI.25.21	And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was taken into exile out of its land.
2KI.25.23	Now when all the captains of the forces in the open country
2KI.25.24	And Gedaliah swore to them and their men, saying, “Do not be afraid because of the Chaldean officials; dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.” 
2KI.25.25	But in the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of the royal family, came with ten men, and attacked and killed Gedaliah and the Jews and the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah. 
2KI.25.26	Then all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces arose, and went to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.
2KI.25.28	and he spoke kindly to him, and gave him a seat above the seats of the kings who were with him in Babylon. 
2KI.25.29	So Jehoiachin put off his prison garments. And every day of his life he dined regularly at the king's table; 
2KI.25.30	and for his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king, every day a portion, as long as he lived.

1CH.9.18	stationed hitherto in the king's gate on the east side. These were the gatekeepers of the camp of the Levites. 
1CH.9.19	Shallum the son of Kore, son of Ebiasaph, son of Korah, and his kinsmen of his fathers' house, the Korahites, were in charge of the work of the service, keepers of the thresholds of the tent, as their fathers had been in charge of the camp of the

1CH.9.22	All these, who were chosen as gatekeepers at the thresholds, were two hundred and twelve. They were enrolled by genealogies in their villages. David and Samuel the seer established them in their office of trust. 
1CH.9.23	So they and their sons were in charge of the gates of the house of the 
1CH.9.24	The gatekeepers were on the four sides, east, west, north, and south; 
1CH.9.25	and their kinsmen who were in their villages were obliged to come in every seven days, from time to time, to be with these; 
1CH.9.26	for the four chief gatekeepers, who were Levites, were in charge of the chambers and the treasures of the house of God.

1CH.9.39	Ner was the father of Kish, Kish of Saul, Saul of Jonathan, Malchishua, Abinadab, and Eshbaal;

1CH.10.2	And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchishua, the sons of Saul. 
1CH.10.3	The battle pressed hard upon Saul, and the archers found him; and he was wounded by the archers. 
1CH.10.4	Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and make sport of me.” But his armor-bearer would not; for he feared greatly. Therefore Saul took his own sword, and fell upon it. 
1CH.10.5	And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword, and died. 
1CH.10.6	Thus Saul died; he and his three sons and all his house died together. 
1CH.10.7	And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that the army
1CH.10.8	On the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 
1CH.10.9	And they stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines, to carry the good news to their idols and to the people. 
1CH.10.10	And they put his armor in the temple of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon. 
1CH.10.11	But when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul, 
1CH.10.12	all the valiant men arose, and took away the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh. And they buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
1CH.10.13	So Saul died for his unfaithfulness; he was unfaithful to the 
1CH.10.14	and did not seek guidance from the 
1CH.11.2	In times past, even when Saul was king, it was you that led out and brought in Israel; and the 
1CH.11.3	So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron; and David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the 
1CH.11.5	The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You will not come in here.” Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David. 
1CH.11.6	David said, “Whoever shall smite the Jebusites first shall be chief and commander.” And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became chief. 
1CH.11.7	And David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore it was called the city of David. 
1CH.11.8	And he built the city round about from the Millo in complete circuit; and Joab repaired the rest of the city. 
1CH.11.9	And David became greater and greater, for the 
1CH.11.11	This is an account of David's mighty men: Jashobe-am, a Hachmonite, was chief of the three;
1CH.11.12	And next to him among the three mighty men was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite. 
1CH.11.13	He was with David at Pas-dammim when the Philistines were gathered there for battle. There was a plot of ground full of barley, and the men fled from the Philistines. 
1CH.11.14	But he
1CH.11.15	Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David at the cave of Adullam, when the army of Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim. 
1CH.11.16	David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem. 
1CH.11.17	And David said longingly, “O that some one would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate!” 
1CH.11.18	Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem which was by the gate, and took and brought it to David. But David would not drink of it; he poured it out to the 
1CH.11.19	and said, “Far be it from me before my God that I should do this. Shall I drink the lifeblood of these men? For at the risk of their lives they brought it.” Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.
1CH.11.20	Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, was chief of the thirty.
1CH.11.21	He was the most renowned
1CH.11.22	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a valiant man
1CH.11.23	And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits tall. The Egyptian had in his hand a spear like a weaver's beam; but Benaiah went down to him with a staff, and snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. 
1CH.11.24	These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and won a name beside the three mighty men. 
1CH.11.25	He was renowned among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David set him over his bodyguard.
1CH.11.26	The mighty men of the armies were Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, 
1CH.11.27	Shammoth of Harod,
1CH.11.28	Ira the son of Ikkesh of Tekoa, Abi-ezer of Anathoth, 
1CH.11.29	Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, 
1CH.11.30	Maharai of Netophah, Heled the son of Baanah of Netophah, 
1CH.11.31	Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the Benjaminites, Benaiah of Pirathon, 
1CH.11.32	Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, 
1CH.11.33	Azmaveth of Baharum, Eliahba of Sha-albon, 
1CH.11.34	Hashem
1CH.11.35	Ahiam the son of Sachar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur, 
1CH.11.36	Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, 
1CH.11.37	Hezro of Carmel, Naarai the son of Ezbai, 
1CH.11.38	Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri, 
1CH.11.39	Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai of Be-eroth, the armor-bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah, 
1CH.11.40	Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 
1CH.11.41	Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai, 
1CH.11.42	Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a leader of the Reubenites, and thirty with him, 
1CH.11.43	Hanan the son of Maacah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite, 
1CH.11.44	Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Je-iel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite, 
1CH.11.45	Jedia-el the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite, 
1CH.11.46	Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elna-am, and Ithmah the Moabite, 
1CH.11.47	Eliel, and Obed, and Ja-asiel the Mezoba-ite.
1CH.12.1	Now these are the men who came to David at Ziklag, while he could not move about freely because of Saul the son of Kish; and they were among the mighty men who helped him in war. 
1CH.12.2	They were bowmen, and could shoot arrows and sling stones with either the right or the left hand; they were Benjaminites, Saul's kinsmen. 
1CH.12.3	The chief was Ahi-ezer, then Joash, both sons of Shemaah of Gibe-ah; also Jezi-el and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah, Jehu of Anathoth, 
1CH.12.4	Ishmaiah of Gibeon, a mighty man among the thirty and a leader over the thirty; Jeremiah,
1CH.12.5	Eluzai,
1CH.12.6	Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Jo-ezer, and Jashobe-am, the Korahites; 
1CH.12.7	And Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.
1CH.12.8	From the Gadites there went over to David at the stronghold in the wilderness mighty and experienced warriors, expert with shield and spear, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and who were swift as gazelles upon the mountains: 
1CH.12.9	Ezer the chief, Obadiah second, Eliab third, 
1CH.12.10	Mishmannah fourth, Jeremiah fifth, 
1CH.12.11	Attai sixth, Eliel seventh, 
1CH.12.12	Johanan eighth, Elzabad ninth, 
1CH.12.13	Jeremiah tenth, Machbannai eleventh. 
1CH.12.14	These Gadites were officers of the army, the lesser over a hundred and the greater over a thousand. 
1CH.12.15	These are the men who crossed the Jordan in the first month, when it was overflowing all its banks, and put to flight all those in the valleys, to the east and to the west.
1CH.12.16	And some of the men of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to David. 
1CH.12.17	David went out to meet them and said to them, “If you have come to me in friendship to help me, my heart will be knit to you; but if to betray me to my adversaries, although there is no wrong in my hands, then may the God of our fathers see and rebuke you.” 
1CH.12.18	Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, chief of the thirty, and he said,
1CH.12.18	“We are yours, O David;
1CH.12.18	and with you, O son of Jesse!
1CH.12.18	Peace, peace to you,
1CH.12.18	and peace to your helpers!
1CH.12.18	For your God helps you.”
1CH.12.18	Then David received them, and made them officers of his troops.
1CH.12.19	Some of the men of Manasseh deserted to David when he came with the Philistines for the battle against Saul. (Yet he did not help them, for the rulers of the Philistines took counsel and sent him away, saying, “At peril to our heads he will desert to his master Saul.”) 
1CH.12.20	As he went to Ziklag these men of Manasseh deserted to him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jedia-el, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, chiefs of thousands in Manasseh. 
1CH.12.21	They helped David against the band of raiders;
1CH.12.22	For from day to day men kept coming to David to help him, until there was a great army, like an army of God.
1CH.12.23	These are the numbers of the divisions of the armed troops, who came to David in Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul over to him, according to the word of the 
1CH.12.24	The men of Judah bearing shield and spear were six thousand eight hundred armed troops. 
1CH.12.25	Of the Simeonites, mighty men of valor for war, seven thousand one hundred. 
1CH.12.26	Of the Levites four thousand six hundred. 
1CH.12.27	The prince Jehoiada, of the house of Aaron, and with him three thousand seven hundred. 
1CH.12.28	Zadok, a young man mighty in valor, and twenty-two commanders from his own father's house. 
1CH.12.29	Of the Benjaminites, the kinsmen of Saul, three thousand, of whom the majority had hitherto kept their allegiance to the house of Saul. 
1CH.12.30	Of the Ephraimites twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous men in their fathers' houses. 
1CH.12.31	Of the half-tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were expressly named to come and make David king. 
1CH.12.32	Of Issachar men who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, two hundred chiefs, and all their kinsmen under their command. 
1CH.12.33	Of Zebulun fifty thousand seasoned troops, equipped for battle with all the weapons of war, to help David
1CH.12.34	Of Naphtali a thousand commanders with whom were thirty-seven thousand men armed with shield and spear. 
1CH.12.35	Of the Danites twenty-eight thousand six hundred men equipped for battle. 
1CH.12.36	Of Asher forty thousand seasoned troops ready for battle. 
1CH.12.37	Of the Reubenites and Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh from beyond the Jordan, one hundred and twenty thousand men armed with all the weapons of war.
1CH.12.38	All these, men of war, arrayed in battle order, came to Hebron with full intent to make David king over all Israel; likewise all the rest of Israel were of a single mind to make David king. 
1CH.12.39	And they were there with David for three days, eating and drinking, for their brethren had made preparation for them. 
1CH.12.40	And also their neighbors, from as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, came bringing food on asses and on camels and on mules and on oxen, abundant provisions of meal, cakes of figs, clusters of raisins, and wine and oil, oxen and sheep, for there was joy in Israel.
1CH.13.2	And David said to all the assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you, and if it is the will of the 
1CH.13.3	Then let us bring again the ark of our God to us; for we neglected it in the days of Saul.” 
1CH.13.4	All the assembly agreed to do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
1CH.13.5	So David assembled all Israel from the Shihor of Egypt to the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim. 
1CH.13.6	And David and all Israel went up to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim which belongs to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the name of the 
1CH.13.7	And they carried the ark of God upon a new cart, from the house of Abinadab, and Uzzah and Ahio
1CH.13.8	And David and all Israel were making merry before God with all their might, with song and lyres and harps and tambourines and cymbals and trumpets.
1CH.13.9	And when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzzah put out his hand to hold the ark, for the oxen stumbled. 
1CH.13.10	And the anger of the 
1CH.13.11	And David was angry because the 
1CH.13.12	And David was afraid of God that day; and he said, “How can I bring the ark of God home to me?” 
1CH.13.13	So David did not take the ark home into the city of David, but took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. 
1CH.13.14	And the ark of God remained with the household of Obed-edom in his house three months; and the 
1CH.14.2	And David perceived that the 
1CH.14.4	These are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
1CH.14.5	Ibhar, Elishu-a, Elpelet, 
1CH.14.6	Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 
1CH.14.7	Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
1CH.14.9	Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim. 
1CH.14.10	And David inquired of God, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Wilt thou give them into my hand?” And the 
1CH.14.11	And he went up to Baal-perazim, and David defeated them there; and David said, “God has broken through
1CH.14.12	And they left their gods there, and David gave command, and they were burned.
1CH.14.14	And when David again inquired of God, God said to him, “You shall not go up after them; go around and come upon them opposite the balsam trees. 
1CH.14.15	And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then go out to battle; for God has gone out before you to smite the army of the Philistines.” 
1CH.14.16	And David did as God commanded him, and they smote the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer. 
1CH.14.17	And the fame of David went out into all lands, and the 
1CH.15.2	Then David said, “No one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, for the 
1CH.15.3	And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the 
1CH.15.4	And David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites: 
1CH.15.5	of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, with a hundred and twenty of his brethren; 
1CH.15.6	of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, with two hundred and twenty of his brethren; 
1CH.15.7	of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, with a hundred and thirty of his brethren; 
1CH.15.8	of the sons of Eli-zaphan, Shemaiah the chief, with two hundred of his brethren; 
1CH.15.9	of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, with eighty of his brethren; 
1CH.15.10	of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, with a hundred and twelve of his brethren. 
1CH.15.11	Then David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar, and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab, 
1CH.15.12	and said to them, “You are the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites; sanctify yourselves, you and your brethren, so that you may bring up the ark of the 
1CH.15.13	Because you did not carry it the first time,
1CH.15.14	So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the 
1CH.15.15	And the Levites carried the ark of God upon their shoulders with the poles, as Moses had commanded according to the word of the 
1CH.15.16	David also commanded the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brethren as the singers who should play loudly on musical instruments, on harps and lyres and cymbals, to raise sounds of joy. 
1CH.15.17	So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari, their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; 
1CH.15.18	and with them their brethren of the second order, Zechariah, Ja-aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Ma-aseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Je-iel. 
1CH.15.19	The singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were to sound bronze cymbals; 
1CH.15.20	Zechariah, Azi-el, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Ma-aseiah, and Benaiah were to play harps according to Alamoth; 
1CH.15.21	but Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Je-iel, and Azaziah were to lead with lyres according to the Sheminith. 
1CH.15.22	Chenaniah, leader of the Levites in music, should direct the music, for he understood it. 
1CH.15.23	Berechiah and Elkanah were to be gatekeepers for the ark. 
1CH.15.24	Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, should blow the trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah also were to be gatekeepers for the ark.
1CH.15.25	So David and the elders of Israel, and the commanders of thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.15.26	And because God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.15.27	David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as also were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the leader of the music of the singers; and David wore a linen ephod. 
1CH.15.28	So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.15.29	And as the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.16.1	And they brought in the ark of God, and set it inside the tent which David had pitched for it; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God. 
1CH.16.2	And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the 
1CH.16.3	and distributed to all Israel, both men and women, to each a loaf of bread, a portion of meat,
1CH.16.4	Moreover he appointed certain of the Levites as ministers before the ark of the 
1CH.16.5	Asaph was the chief, and second to him were Zechariah, Je-iel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Je-iel, who were to play harps and lyres; Asaph was to sound the cymbals, 
1CH.16.6	and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests were to blow trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.
1CH.16.7	Then on that day David first appointed that thanksgiving be sung to the 
1CH.16.8	make known his deeds among the peoples!
1CH.16.9	Sing to him, sing praises to him,
1CH.16.9	tell of all his wonderful works!
1CH.16.10	Glory in his holy name;
1CH.16.10	let the hearts of those who seek the 
1CH.16.11	Seek the 
1CH.16.11	seek his presence continually!
1CH.16.12	Remember the wonderful works that he has done,
1CH.16.12	the wonders he wrought, the judgments he uttered,
1CH.16.13	O offspring of Abraham his servant,
1CH.16.13	sons of Jacob, his chosen ones!
1CH.16.14	He is the 
1CH.16.14	his judgments are in all the earth.
1CH.16.15	He is mindful of his covenant for ever,
1CH.16.15	of the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations,
1CH.16.16	the covenant which he made with Abraham,
1CH.16.16	his sworn promise to Isaac,
1CH.16.17	which he confirmed as a statute to Jacob,
1CH.16.17	as an everlasting covenant to Israel,
1CH.16.18	saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan,
1CH.16.18	as your portion for an inheritance.”
1CH.16.19	When they were few in number,
1CH.16.19	and of little account, and sojourners in it,
1CH.16.20	wandering from nation to nation,
1CH.16.20	from one kingdom to another people,
1CH.16.21	he allowed no one to oppress them;
1CH.16.21	he rebuked kings on their account,
1CH.16.22	saying, “Touch not my anointed ones,
1CH.16.22	do my prophets no harm!”
1CH.16.23	Tell of his salvation from day to day.
1CH.16.24	Declare his glory among the nations,
1CH.16.24	his marvelous works among all the peoples!
1CH.16.25	For great is the 
1CH.16.25	and he is to be held in awe above all gods.
1CH.16.26	For all the gods of the peoples are idols;
1CH.16.26	but the 
1CH.16.27	Honor and majesty are before him;
1CH.16.27	strength and joy are in his place.
1CH.16.28	Ascribe to the 
1CH.16.28	ascribe to the 
1CH.16.29	Ascribe to the 
1CH.16.29	bring an offering, and come before him!
1CH.16.29	Worship the 
1CH.16.30	tremble before him, all the earth;
1CH.16.30	yea, the world stands firm, never to be moved.
1CH.16.31	Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice,
1CH.16.31	and let them say among the nations, “The 
1CH.16.32	Let the sea roar, and all that fills it,
1CH.16.32	let the field exult, and everything in it!
1CH.16.33	Then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy
1CH.16.33	before the 
1CH.16.34	for his steadfast love endures for ever!
1CH.16.35	“Deliver us, O God of our salvation,
1CH.16.35	and gather and save us from among the nations,
1CH.16.35	that we may give thanks to thy holy name,
1CH.16.35	and glory in thy praise.
1CH.16.36	Blessed be the 
1CH.16.36	from everlasting to everlasting!”
1CH.16.36	Then all the people said, “Amen!” and praised the 
1CH.16.37	So David left Asaph and his brethren there before the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.16.38	and also Obed-edom and his
1CH.16.39	And he left Zadok the priest and his brethren the priests before the tabernacle of the 
1CH.16.40	to offer burnt offerings to the 
1CH.16.41	With them were Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest of those chosen and expressly named to give thanks to the 
1CH.16.42	Heman and Jeduthun had trumpets and cymbals for the music and instruments for sacred song. The sons of Jeduthun were appointed to the gate.
1CH.16.43	Then all the people departed each to his house, and David went home to bless his household.
1CH.17.2	And Nathan said to David, “Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you.”
1CH.17.3	But that same night the word of the 
1CH.17.4	“Go and tell my servant David, ‘Thus says the 
1CH.17.5	For I have not dwelt in a house since the day I led up Israel to this day, but I have gone from tent to tent and from dwelling to dwelling. 
1CH.17.6	In all places where I have moved with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people, saying, “Why have you not built me a house of cedar?” ’ 
1CH.17.7	Now therefore thus shall you say to my servant David, ‘Thus says the 
1CH.17.8	and I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make for you a name, like the name of the great ones of the earth. 
1CH.17.9	And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be disturbed no more; and violent men shall waste them no more, as formerly, 
1CH.17.10	from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel; and I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I declare to you that the 
1CH.17.11	When your days are fulfilled to go to be with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom. 
1CH.17.12	He shall build a house for me, and I will establish his throne for ever. 
1CH.17.13	I will be his father, and he shall be my son; I will not take my steadfast love from him, as I took it from him who was before you, 
1CH.17.14	but I will confirm him in my house and in my kingdom for ever and his throne shall be established for ever.’ ” 
1CH.17.15	In accordance with all these words, and in accordance with all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.
1CH.17.16	Then King David went in and sat before the 
1CH.17.17	And this was a small thing in thy eyes, O God; thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast shown me future generations,
1CH.17.18	And what more can David say to thee for honoring thy servant? For thou knowest thy servant. 
1CH.17.19	For thy servant's sake, O 
1CH.17.20	There is none like thee, O 
1CH.17.21	What other
1CH.17.22	And thou didst make thy people Israel to be thy people for ever; and thou, O 
1CH.17.23	And now, O 
1CH.17.24	and thy name will be established and magnified for ever, saying, ‘The 
1CH.17.25	For thou, my God, hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build a house for him; therefore thy servant has found courage to pray before thee. 
1CH.17.26	And now, O 
1CH.17.27	now therefore may it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee; for what thou, O 
1CH.18.2	And he defeated Moab, and the Moabites became servants to David and brought tribute.
1CH.18.3	David also defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah, toward Hamath, as he went to set up his monument
1CH.18.4	And David took from him a thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but left enough for a hundred chariots. 
1CH.18.5	And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew twenty-two thousand men of the Syrians. 
1CH.18.6	Then David put garrisons
1CH.18.7	And David took the shields of gold which were carried by the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 
1CH.18.8	And from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took very much bronze; with it Solomon made the bronze sea and the pillars and the vessels of bronze.
1CH.18.9	When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the whole army of Hadadezer, king of Zobah, 
1CH.18.10	he sent his son Hadoram to King David, to greet him, and to congratulate him because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him; for Hadadezer had often been at war with Tou. And he sent all sorts of articles of gold, of silver, and of bronze; 
1CH.18.11	these also King David dedicated to the 
1CH.18.12	And Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, slew eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 
1CH.18.13	And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. And the 
1CH.18.15	And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; 
1CH.18.16	and Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were priests; and Shavsha was secretary; 
1CH.18.17	and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were the chief officials in the service of the king.
1CH.19.2	And David said, “I will deal loyally with Hanun the son of Nahash, for his father dealt loyally with me.” So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. And David's servants came to Hanun in the land of the Ammonites, to console him. 
1CH.19.3	But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun, “Do you think, because David has sent comforters to you, that he is honoring your father? Have not his servants come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?” 
1CH.19.4	So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, at their hips, and sent them away; 
1CH.19.5	and they departed. When David was told concerning the men, he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, “Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.”
1CH.19.6	When the Ammonites saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, from Aram-maacah, and from Zobah. 
1CH.19.7	They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and the king of Maacah with his army, who came and encamped before Medeba. And the Ammonites were mustered from their cities and came to battle. 
1CH.19.8	When David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men. 
1CH.19.9	And the Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the city, and the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.
1CH.19.10	When Joab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the picked men of Israel, and arrayed them against the Syrians; 
1CH.19.11	the rest of his men he put in the charge of Abishai his brother, and they were arrayed against the Ammonites. 
1CH.19.12	And he said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will help you. 
1CH.19.13	Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people, and for the cities of our God; and may the 
1CH.19.14	So Joab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians for battle; and they fled before him. 
1CH.19.15	And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, Joab's brother, and entered the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
1CH.19.16	But when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the Euphrates, with Shophach the commander of the army of Hadadezer at their head. 
1CH.19.17	And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and crossed the Jordan, and came to them, and drew up his forces against them. And when David set the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him. 
1CH.19.18	And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians the men of seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand foot soldiers, and killed also Shophach the commander of their army. 
1CH.19.19	And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David, and became subject to him. So the Syrians were not willing to help the Ammonites any more.
1CH.20.2	And David took the crown of their king
1CH.20.3	And he brought forth the people who were in it, and set them to labor
1CH.20.5	And there was again war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. 
1CH.20.6	And there was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on each hand, and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number; and he also was descended from the giants. 
1CH.20.7	And when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shime-a, David's brother, slew him. 
1CH.20.8	These were descended from the giants in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.
1CH.21.2	So David said to Joab and the commanders of the army, “Go, number Israel, from Beer-sheba to Dan, and bring me a report, that I may know their number.” 
1CH.21.3	But Joab said, “May the 
1CH.21.4	But the king's word prevailed against Joab. So Joab departed and went throughout all Israel, and came back to Jerusalem. 
1CH.21.5	And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to David. In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand men who drew the sword, and in Judah four hundred and seventy thousand who drew the sword. 
1CH.21.6	But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, for the king's command was abhorrent to Joab.
1CH.21.7	But God was displeased with this thing, and he smote Israel. 
1CH.21.8	And David said to God, “I have sinned greatly in that I have done this thing. But now, I pray thee, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.” 
1CH.21.9	And the 
1CH.21.10	“Go and say to David, ‘Thus says the 
1CH.21.11	So Gad came to David and said to him, “Thus says the 
1CH.21.12	either three years of famine; or three months of devastation by your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days of the sword of the 
1CH.21.13	Then David said to Gad, “I am in great distress; let me fall into the hand of the 
1CH.21.14	So the 
1CH.21.15	And God sent the angel to Jerusalem to destroy it; but when he was about to destroy it, the 
1CH.21.16	And David lifted his eyes and saw the angel of the 
1CH.21.17	And David said to God, “Was it not I who gave command to number the people? It is I who have sinned and done very wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? Let thy hand, I pray thee, O 
1CH.21.18	Then the angel of the 
1CH.21.19	So David went up at Gad's word, which he had spoken in the name of the 
1CH.21.20	Now Ornan was threshing wheat; he turned and saw the angel, and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. 
1CH.21.21	As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David and went forth from the threshing floor, and did obeisance to David with his face to the ground. 
1CH.21.22	And David said to Ornan, “Give me the site of the threshing floor that I may build on it an altar to the 
1CH.21.23	Then Ornan said to David, “Take it; and let my lord the king do what seems good to him; see, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for a cereal offering. I give it all.” 
1CH.21.24	But King David said to Ornan, “No, but I will buy it for the full price; I will not take for the 
1CH.21.25	So David paid Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the site. 
1CH.21.26	And David built there an altar to the 
1CH.21.27	Then the 
1CH.21.28	At that time, when David saw that the 
1CH.21.29	For the tabernacle of the 
1CH.21.30	but David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the 
1CH.22.1	Then David said, “Here shall be the house of the 
1CH.22.2	David commanded to gather together the aliens who were in the land of Israel, and he set stonecutters to prepare dressed stones for building the house of God. 
1CH.22.3	David also provided great stores of iron for nails for the doors of the gates and for clamps, as well as bronze in quantities beyond weighing, 
1CH.22.4	and cedar timbers without number; for the Sidonians and Tyrians brought great quantities of cedar to David. 
1CH.22.5	For David said, “Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for the 
1CH.22.6	Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for the 
1CH.22.7	David said to Solomon, “My son, I had it in my heart to build a house to the name of the 
1CH.22.8	But the word of the 
1CH.22.9	Behold, a son shall be born to you; he shall be a man of peace. I will give him peace from all his enemies round about; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel in his days. 
1CH.22.10	He shall build a house for my name. He shall be my son, and I will be his father, and I will establish his royal throne in Israel for ever.’ 
1CH.22.11	Now, my son, the 
1CH.22.12	Only, may the 
1CH.22.13	Then you will prosper if you are careful to observe the statutes and the ordinances which the 
1CH.22.14	With great pains I have provided for the house of the 
1CH.22.15	You have an abundance of workmen: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and all kinds of craftsmen without number, skilled in working 
1CH.22.16	gold, silver, bronze, and iron. Arise and be doing! The 
1CH.22.17	David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying, 
1CH.22.18	“Is not the 
1CH.22.19	Now set your mind and heart to seek the 
1CH.23.1	When David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
1CH.23.2	David assembled all the leaders of Israel and the priests and the Levites. 
1CH.23.3	The Levites, thirty years old and upward, were numbered, and the total was thirty-eight thousand men. 
1CH.23.4	“Twenty-four thousand of these,” David said, “shall have charge of the work in the house of the 
1CH.23.5	four thousand gatekeepers, and four thousand shall offer praises to the 
1CH.23.6	And David organized them in divisions corresponding to the sons of Levi: Gershom, Kohath, and Merari.
1CH.23.7	The sons of Gershom
1CH.23.8	The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three. 
1CH.23.9	The sons of Shime-i: Shelomoth, Hazi-el, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers' houses of Ladan. 
1CH.23.10	And the sons of Shime-i: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shime-i. 
1CH.23.11	Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons, therefore they became a father's house in one reckoning.
1CH.23.12	The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. 
1CH.23.13	The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron was set apart to consecrate the most holy things, that he and his sons for ever should burn incense before the 
1CH.23.14	But the sons of Moses the man of God were named among the tribe of Levi. 
1CH.23.15	The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer. 
1CH.23.16	The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief. 
1CH.23.17	The sons of Eliezer: Rehabiah the chief; Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very many. 
1CH.23.18	The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief. 
1CH.23.19	The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. 
1CH.23.20	The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief and Isshiah the second.
1CH.23.21	The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish. 
1CH.23.22	Eleazar died having no sons, but only daughters; their kinsmen, the sons of Kish, married them. 
1CH.23.23	The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
1CH.23.24	These were the sons of Levi by their fathers' houses, the heads of fathers' houses as they were registered according to the number of the names of the individuals from twenty years old and upward who were to do the work for the service of the house of the 
1CH.23.25	For David said, “The 
1CH.23.26	And so the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the things for its service” — 
1CH.23.27	for by the last words of David these were the number of the Levites from twenty years old and upward— 
1CH.23.28	“but their duty shall be to assist the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the 
1CH.23.29	to assist also with the showbread, the flour for the cereal offering, the wafers of unleavened bread, the baked offering, the offering mixed with oil, and all measures of quantity or size. 
1CH.23.30	And they shall stand every morning, thanking and praising the 
1CH.23.31	and whenever burnt offerings are offered to the

1CH.24.3	With the help of Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, David organized them according to the appointed duties in their service. 
1CH.24.4	Since more chief men were found among the sons of Eleazar than among the sons of Ithamar, they organized them under sixteen heads of fathers' houses of the sons of Eleazar, and eight of the sons of Ithamar.

1CH.25.1	David and the chiefs of the service also set apart for the service certain of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with lyres, with harps, and with cymbals. The list of those who did the work and of their duties was:

1CH.28.2	Then King David rose to his feet and said: “Hear me, my brethren and my people. I had it in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.28.3	But God said to me, ‘You may not build a house for my name, for you are a warrior and have shed blood.’ 
1CH.28.4	Yet the 
1CH.28.5	And of all my sons (for the 
1CH.28.6	He said to me, ‘It is Solomon your son who shall build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father. 
1CH.28.7	I will establish his kingdom for ever if he continues resolute in keeping my commandments and my ordinances, as he is today.’ 
1CH.28.8	Now therefore in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the 
1CH.28.9	“And you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, and serve him with a whole heart and with a willing mind; for the 
1CH.28.10	Take heed now, for the 
1CH.28.11	Then David gave Solomon his son the plan of the vestibule of the temple, and of its houses, its treasuries, its upper rooms, and its inner chambers, and of the room for the mercy seat; 
1CH.28.12	and the plan of all that he had in mind for the courts of the house of the 
1CH.28.13	for the divisions of the priests and of the Levites, and all the work of the service in the house of the 
1CH.28.14	the weight of gold for all golden vessels for each service, the weight of silver vessels for each service, 
1CH.28.15	the weight of the golden lampstands and their lamps, the weight of gold for each lampstand and its lamps, the weight of silver for a lampstand and its lamps, according to the use of each lampstand in the service, 
1CH.28.16	the weight of gold for each table for the showbread, the silver for the silver tables, 
1CH.28.17	and pure gold for the forks, the basins, and the cups; for the golden bowls and the weight of each; for the silver bowls and the weight of each; 
1CH.28.18	for the altar of incense made of refined gold, and its weight; also his plan for the golden chariot of the cherubim that spread their wings and covered the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.28.19	All this he made clear by the writing from the hand of the 
1CH.28.20	Then David said to Solomon his son, “Be strong and of good courage, and do it. Fear not, be not dismayed; for the 
1CH.28.21	And behold the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God; and with you in all the work will be every willing man who has skill for any kind of service; also the officers and all the people will be wholly at your command.”
1CH.29.1	And David the king said to all the assembly, “Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is young and inexperienced, and the work is great; for the palace will not be for man but for the 
1CH.29.2	So I have provided for the house of my God, so far as I was able, the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, and the bronze for the things of bronze, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood, besides great quantities of onyx and stones for setting, antimony, colored stones, all sorts of precious stones, and marble. 
1CH.29.3	Moreover, in addition to all that I have provided for the holy house, I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, and because of my devotion to the house of my God I give it to the house of my God: 
1CH.29.4	three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, for overlaying the walls of the house, 
1CH.29.5	and for all the work to be done by craftsmen, gold for the things of gold and silver for the things of silver. Who then will offer willingly, consecrating himself today to the 
1CH.29.6	Then the heads of fathers' houses made their freewill offerings, as did also the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and the officers over the king's work. 
1CH.29.7	They gave for the service of the house of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents of bronze, and a hundred thousand talents of iron. 
1CH.29.8	And whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the 
1CH.29.9	Then the people rejoiced because these had given willingly, for with a whole heart they had offered freely to the 
1CH.29.10	Therefore David blessed the 
1CH.29.11	Thine, O 
1CH.29.12	Both riches and honor come from thee, and thou rulest over all. In thy hand are power and might; and in thy hand it is to make great and to give strength to all. 
1CH.29.13	And now we thank thee, our God, and praise thy glorious name.
1CH.29.14	“But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly? For all things come from thee, and of thy own have we given thee. 
1CH.29.15	For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as all our fathers were; our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no abiding.
1CH.29.16	O 
1CH.29.17	I know, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness; in the uprightness of my heart I have freely offered all these things, and now I have seen thy people, who are present here, offering freely and joyously to thee. 
1CH.29.18	O 
1CH.29.19	Grant to Solomon my son that with a whole heart he may keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, performing all, and that he may build the palace for which I have made provision.”
1CH.29.20	Then David said to all the assembly, “Bless the 
1CH.29.21	And they performed sacrifices to the 
1CH.29.22	and they ate and drank before the 
1CH.29.22	And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and they anointed him as prince for the 
1CH.29.23	 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the 
1CH.29.24	All the leaders and the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon. 
1CH.29.25	And the 
1CH.29.26	Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. 
1CH.29.27	The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. 
1CH.29.28	Then he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor; and Solomon his son reigned in his stead. 
1CH.29.29	Now the acts of King David, from first to last, are written in the Chronicles of Samuel the seer, and in the Chronicles of Nathan the prophet, and in the Chronicles of Gad the seer, 
1CH.29.30	with accounts of all his rule and his might and of the circumstances that came upon him and upon Israel, and upon all the kingdoms of the countries.
2CH.1.1	Solomon the son of David established himself in his kingdom, and the 
2CH.1.2	Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to all the leaders in all Israel, the heads of fathers' houses. 
2CH.1.3	 And Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of the 
2CH.1.4	(But David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place that David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.) 
2CH.1.5	Moreover the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of the 
2CH.1.6	And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the 
2CH.1.7	In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, “Ask what I shall give you.” 
2CH.1.8	And Solomon said to God, “Thou hast shown great and steadfast love to David my father, and hast made me king in his stead. 
2CH.1.9	O 
2CH.1.10	Give me now wisdom and knowledge to go out and come in before this people, for who can rule this thy people, that is so great?” 
2CH.1.11	God answered Solomon, “Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked possessions, wealth, honor, or the life of those who hate you, and have not even asked long life, but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself that you may rule my people over whom I have made you king, 
2CH.1.12	wisdom and knowledge are granted to you. I will also give you riches, possessions, and honor, such as none of the kings had who were before you, and none after you shall have the like.” 
2CH.1.13	So Solomon came from
2CH.1.15	And the king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah. 
2CH.1.16	And Solomon's import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, and the king's traders received them from Kue for a price. 
2CH.1.17	They imported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; likewise through them these were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.
2CH.2.3	 And Solomon sent word to Huram the king of Tyre: “As you dealt with David my father and sent him cedar to build himself a house to dwell in, so deal with me. 
2CH.2.4	Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of the 
2CH.2.5	The house which I am to build will be great, for our God is greater than all gods. 
2CH.2.6	But who is able to build him a house, since heaven, even highest heaven, cannot contain him? Who am I to build a house for him, except as a place to burn incense before him? 
2CH.2.7	So now send me a man skilled to work in gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue fabrics, trained also in engraving, to be with the skilled workers who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, whom David my father provided. 
2CH.2.8	Send me also cedar, cypress, and algum timber from Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon. And my servants will be with your servants, 
2CH.2.9	to prepare timber for me in abundance, for the house I am to build will be great and wonderful. 
2CH.2.10	I will give for your servants, the hewers who cut timber, twenty thousand cors of crushed wheat, twenty thousand cors of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.”
2CH.2.11	Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in a letter which he sent to Solomon, “Because the 
2CH.2.12	Huram also said, “Blessed be the 
2CH.2.13	“Now I have sent a skilled man, endued with understanding, Huramabi, 
2CH.2.14	the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre. He is trained to work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, and in purple, blue, and crimson fabrics and fine linen, and to do all sorts of engraving and execute any design that may be assigned him, with your craftsmen, the craftsmen of my lord, David your father. 
2CH.2.15	Now therefore the wheat and barley, oil and wine, of which my lord has spoken, let him send to his servants; 
2CH.2.16	and we will cut whatever timber you need from Lebanon, and bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa, so that you may take it up to Jerusalem.”
2CH.2.17	Then Solomon took a census of all the aliens who were in the land of Israel, after the census of them which David his father had taken; and there were found a hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred. 
2CH.2.18	Seventy thousand of them he assigned to bear burdens, eighty thousand to quarry in the hill country, and three thousand six hundred as overseers to make the people work.
2CH.3.2	He began to build in the second month of the fourth year of his reign. 
2CH.3.3	These are Solomon's measurements
2CH.3.4	The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits long, equal to the width of the house;
2CH.3.5	The nave he lined with cypress, and covered it with fine gold, and made palms and chains on it. 
2CH.3.6	He adorned the house with settings of precious stones. The gold was gold of Parvaim. 
2CH.3.7	So he lined the house with gold—its beams, its thresholds, its walls, and its doors; and he carved cherubim on the walls.
2CH.3.8	And he made the most holy place; its length, corresponding to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and its breadth was twenty cubits; he overlaid it with six hundred talents of fine gold. 
2CH.3.9	The weight of the nails was one shekel
2CH.3.10	In the most holy place he made two cherubim of wood
2CH.3.11	The wings of the cherubim together extended twenty cubits: one wing of the one, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house, and its other wing, of five cubits, touched the wing of the other cherub; 
2CH.3.12	and of this cherub, one wing, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house, and the other wing, also of five cubits, was joined to the wing of the first cherub. 
2CH.3.13	The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits; the cherubim
2CH.3.14	And he made the veil of blue and purple and crimson fabrics and fine linen, and worked cherubim on it.
2CH.3.16	He made chains like a necklace
2CH.3.17	He set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the south, the other on the north; that on the south he called Jachin, and that on the north Boaz.
2CH.4.1	He made an altar of bronze, twenty cubits long, and twenty cubits wide, and ten cubits high. 
2CH.4.2	 Then he made the molten sea; it was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference. 
2CH.4.3	Under it were figures of gourds,
2CH.4.4	It stood upon twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east; the sea was set upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward. 
2CH.4.5	Its thickness was a handbreadth; and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily; it held over three thousand baths. 
2CH.4.6	 He also made ten lavers in which to wash, and set five on the south side, and five on the north side. In these they were to rinse off what was used for the burnt offering, and the sea was for the priests to wash in.
2CH.4.7	And he made ten golden lampstands as prescribed, and set them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. 
2CH.4.8	He also made ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. And he made a hundred basins of gold. 
2CH.4.9	He made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid their doors with bronze; 
2CH.4.10	and he set the sea at the southeast corner of the house.
2CH.4.11	Huram also made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. So Huram finished the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of God: 
2CH.4.12	the two pillars, the bowls, and the two capitals on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; 
2CH.4.13	and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars. 
2CH.4.14	He made the stands also, and the lavers upon the stands, 
2CH.4.15	and the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath it. 
2CH.4.16	The pots, the shovels, the forks, and all the equipment for these Huramabi made of burnished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the 
2CH.4.17	In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah. 
2CH.4.18	Solomon made all these things in great quantities, so that the weight of the bronze was not ascertained.
2CH.4.19	So Solomon made all the things that were in the house of God: the golden altar, the tables for the bread of the Presence, 
2CH.4.20	the lampstands and their lamps of pure gold to burn before the inner sanctuary, as prescribed; 
2CH.4.21	the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of purest gold; 
2CH.4.22	the snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and firepans, of pure gold; and the sockets
2CH.5.1	Thus all the work that Solomon did for the house of the 
2CH.5.2	Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the fathers' houses of the people of Israel, in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the 
2CH.5.3	And all the men of Israel assembled before the king at the feast which is in the seventh month. 
2CH.5.4	And all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark. 
2CH.5.5	And they brought up the ark, the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent; the priests and the Levites brought them up. 
2CH.5.6	And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who had assembled before him, were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered. 
2CH.5.7	So the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the 
2CH.5.8	For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim made a covering above the ark and its poles. 
2CH.5.9	And the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place before the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside; and they are there to this day. 
2CH.5.10	There was nothing in the ark except the two tables which Moses put there at Horeb, where the 
2CH.5.11	Now when the priests came out of the holy place (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves, without regard to their divisions; 
2CH.5.12	and all the Levitical singers, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, their sons and kinsmen, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals, harps, and lyres, stood east of the altar with a hundred and twenty priests who were trumpeters; 
2CH.5.13	 and it was the duty of the trumpeters and singers to make themselves heard in unison in praise and thanksgiving to the 
2CH.5.13	“For he is good,
2CH.5.13	for his steadfast love endures for ever,”
2CH.5.13	the house, the house of the 
2CH.5.14	so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud; for the glory of the 
2CH.6.1	“The 
2CH.6.2	I have built thee an exalted house,
2CH.6.2	a place for thee to dwell in for ever.”
2CH.6.3	Then the king faced about, and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel stood. 
2CH.6.4	And he said, “Blessed be the 
2CH.6.5	‘Since the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city in all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house, that my name might be there, and I chose no man as prince over my people Israel; 
2CH.6.6	but I have chosen Jerusalem that my name may be there and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.’ 
2CH.6.7	Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the 
2CH.6.8	But the 
2CH.6.9	nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who shall be born to you shall build the house for my name.’ 
2CH.6.10	Now the 
2CH.6.11	And there I have set the ark, in which is the covenant of the 
2CH.6.12	Then Solomon stood before the altar of the 
2CH.6.13	Solomon had made a bronze platform five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the court; and he stood upon it. Then he knelt upon his knees in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven; 
2CH.6.14	and said, “O 
2CH.6.15	who hast kept with thy servant David my father what thou didst declare to him; yea, thou didst speak with thy mouth, and with thy hand hast fulfilled it this day. 
2CH.6.16	Now therefore, O 
2CH.6.17	Now therefore, O 
2CH.6.18	“But will God dwell indeed with man on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built! 
2CH.6.19	Yet have regard to the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication, O 
2CH.6.20	that thy eyes may be open day and night toward this house, the place where thou hast promised to set thy name, that thou mayest hearken to the prayer which thy servant offers toward this place. 
2CH.6.21	And hearken thou to the supplications of thy servant and of thy people Israel, when they pray toward this place; yea, hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place; and when thou hearest, forgive.
2CH.6.22	“If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take an oath, and comes and swears his oath before thy altar in this house, 
2CH.6.23	then hear thou from heaven, and act, and judge thy servants, requiting the guilty by bringing his conduct upon his own head, and vindicating the righteous by rewarding him according to his righteousness.
2CH.6.24	“If thy people Israel are defeated before the enemy because they have sinned against thee, when they turn again and acknowledge thy name, and pray and make supplication to thee in this house, 
2CH.6.25	then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again to the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.
2CH.6.26	“When heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against thee, if they pray toward this place, and acknowledge thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them, 
2CH.6.27	then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, thy people Israel, when thou dost teach them the good way
2CH.6.28	“If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence or blight or mildew or locust or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in any of their cities; whatever plague, whatever sickness there is; 
2CH.6.29	whatever prayer, whatever supplication is made by any man or by all thy people Israel, each knowing his own affliction, and his own sorrow and stretching out his hands toward this house; 
2CH.6.30	then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render to each whose heart thou knowest, according to all his ways (for thou, thou only, knowest the hearts of the children of men); 
2CH.6.31	that they may fear thee and walk in thy ways all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest to our fathers.
2CH.6.32	“Likewise when a foreigner, who is not of thy people Israel, comes from a far country for the sake of thy great name, and thy mighty hand, and thy outstretched arm, when he comes and prays toward this house, 
2CH.6.33	hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to thee; in order that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name and fear thee, as do thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.
2CH.6.34	“If thy people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way thou shalt send them, and they pray to thee toward this city which thou hast chosen and the house which I have built for thy name, 
2CH.6.35	then hear thou from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
2CH.6.36	“If they sin against thee—for there is no man who does not sin—and thou art angry with them, and dost give them to an enemy, so that they are carried away captive to a land far or near; 
2CH.6.37	yet if they lay it to heart in the land to which they have been carried captive, and repent, and make supplication to thee in the land of their captivity, saying, ‘We have sinned, and have acted perversely and wickedly’; 
2CH.6.38	if they repent with all their mind and with all their heart in the land of their captivity, to which they were carried captive, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest to their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name, 
2CH.6.39	then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee. 
2CH.6.40	Now, O my God, let thy eyes be open and thy ears attentive to a prayer of this place.
2CH.6.41	thou and the ark of thy might.
2CH.6.41	Let thy priests, O 
2CH.6.41	and let thy saints rejoice in thy goodness.
2CH.6.42	O 
2CH.6.42	Remember thy steadfast love for David thy servant.”
2CH.7.1	When Solomon had ended his prayer, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the 
2CH.7.2	And the priests could not enter the house of the 
2CH.7.3	When all the children of Israel saw the fire come down and the glory of the 
2CH.7.3	“For he is good,
2CH.7.3	for his steadfast love endures for ever.”
2CH.7.5	King Solomon offered as a sacrifice twenty-two thousand oxen and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God. 
2CH.7.6	The priests stood at their posts; the Levites also, with the instruments for music to the 
2CH.7.7	And Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the 
2CH.7.8	At that time Solomon held the feast for seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt. 
2CH.7.9	And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly; for they had kept the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days. 
2CH.7.10	On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their homes, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that the 
2CH.7.12	Then the 
2CH.7.13	When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or command the locust to devour the land, or send pestilence among my people, 
2CH.7.14	if my people who are called by my name humble themselves, and pray and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land. 
2CH.7.15	Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayer that is made in this place. 
2CH.7.16	For now I have chosen and consecrated this house that my name may be there for ever; my eyes and my heart will be there for all time. 
2CH.7.17	And as for you, if you walk before me, as David your father walked, doing according to all that I have commanded you and keeping my statutes and my ordinances, 
2CH.7.18	then I will establish your royal throne, as I covenanted with David your father, saying, ‘There shall not fail you a man to rule Israel.’
2CH.7.19	“But if you
2CH.7.20	then I will pluck you
2CH.7.21	And at this house, which is exalted, every one passing by will be astonished, and say, ‘Why has the 
2CH.7.22	Then they will say, ‘Because they forsook the 
2CH.8.2	Solomon rebuilt the cities which Huram had given to him, and settled the people of Israel in them.
2CH.8.3	And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and took it. 
2CH.8.4	He built Tadmor in the wilderness and all the store-cities which he built in Hamath. 
2CH.8.5	He also built Upper Beth-horon and Lower Beth-horon, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars, 
2CH.8.6	and Baalath, and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. 
2CH.8.7	All the people who were left of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel, 
2CH.8.8	from their descendants who were left after them in the land, whom the people of Israel had not destroyed—these Solomon made a forced levy and so they are to this day. 
2CH.8.9	But of the people of Israel Solomon made no slaves for his work; they were soldiers, and his officers, the commanders of his chariots, and his horsemen. 
2CH.8.10	And these were the chief officers of King Solomon, two hundred and fifty, who exercised authority over the people.
2CH.8.11	Solomon brought Pharaoh's daughter up from the city of David to the house which he had built for her, for he said, “My wife shall not live in the house of David king of Israel, for the places to which the ark of the 
2CH.8.12	Then Solomon offered up burnt offerings to the 
2CH.8.13	as the duty of each day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses for the sabbaths, the new moons, and the three annual feasts—the feast of unleavened bread, the feast of weeks, and the feast of tabernacles. 
2CH.8.14	According to the ordinance of David his father, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service, and the Levites for their offices of praise and ministry before the priests as the duty of each day required, and the gatekeepers in their divisions for the several gates; for so David the man of God had commanded. 
2CH.8.15	And they did not turn aside from what the king had commanded the priests and Levites concerning any matter and concerning the treasuries.
2CH.8.16	Thus was accomplished all the work of Solomon from
2CH.8.17	Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and Eloth on the shore of the sea, in the land of Edom. 
2CH.8.18	And Huram sent him by his servants ships and servants familiar with the sea, and they went to Ophir together with the servants of Solomon, and fetched from there four hundred and fifty talents of gold and brought it to King Solomon.
2CH.9.2	And Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing hidden from Solomon which he could not explain to her. 
2CH.9.3	And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built, 
2CH.9.4	the food of his table, the seating of his officials, and the attendance of his servants, and their clothing, his cupbearers, and their clothing, and his burnt offerings which he offered at the house of the 
2CH.9.5	And she said to the king, “The report was true which I heard in my own land of your affairs and of your wisdom, 
2CH.9.6	but I did not believe the
2CH.9.7	Happy are your wives!
2CH.9.8	Blessed be the 
2CH.9.9	Then she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and a very great quantity of spices, and precious stones: there were no spices such as those which the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
2CH.9.10	Moreover the servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum wood and precious stones. 
2CH.9.11	And the king made of the algum wood steps
2CH.9.12	And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired, whatever she asked besides what she had brought to the king. So she turned and went back to her own land, with her servants.
2CH.9.13	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold, 
2CH.9.14	besides that which the traders and merchants brought; and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land brought gold and silver to Solomon. 
2CH.9.15	King Solomon made two hundred large shields of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of beaten gold went into each shield. 
2CH.9.16	And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three hundred shekels of gold went into each shield; and the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon. 
2CH.9.17	The king also made a great ivory throne, and overlaid it with pure gold. 
2CH.9.18	The throne had six steps and a footstool of gold, which were attached to the throne, and on each side of the seat were arm rests and two lions standing beside the arm rests, 
2CH.9.19	while twelve lions stood there, one on each end of a step on the six steps. The like of it was never made in any kingdom. 
2CH.9.20	All King Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; silver was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon. 
2CH.9.21	For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years the ships of Tarshish used to come bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
2CH.9.22	Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom. 
2CH.9.23	And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his mind. 
2CH.9.24	Every one of them brought his present, articles of silver and of gold, garments, myrrh, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year. 
2CH.9.25	And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. 
2CH.9.26	And he ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt. 
2CH.9.27	And the king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stone, and cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah. 
2CH.9.28	And horses were imported for Solomon from Egypt and from all lands.
2CH.9.29	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, from first to last, are they not written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat? 
2CH.9.30	 Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. 
2CH.9.31	And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father; and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.10.2	And when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was in Egypt, whither he had fled from King Solomon), then Jeroboam returned from Egypt. 
2CH.10.3	And they sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came and said to Rehoboam, 
2CH.10.4	“Your father made our yoke heavy. Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke upon us, and we will serve you.” 
2CH.10.5	He said to them, “Come to me again in three days.” So the people went away.
2CH.10.6	Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he was yet alive, saying, “How do you advise me to answer this people?” 
2CH.10.7	And they said to him, “If you will be kind to this people and please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants for ever.” 
2CH.10.8	But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him. 
2CH.10.9	And he said to them, “What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, ‘Lighten the yoke that your father put upon us’?” 
2CH.10.10	And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, “Thus shall you speak to the people who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but do you lighten it for us’; thus shall you say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father's loins. 
2CH.10.11	And now, whereas my father laid upon you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.’ ”
2CH.10.12	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king said, “Come to me again the third day.” 
2CH.10.13	And the king answered them harshly, and forsaking the counsel of the old men, 
2CH.10.14	King Rehoboam spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.” 
2CH.10.15	So the king did not hearken to the people; for it was a turn of affairs brought about by God that the 
2CH.10.16	And when all Israel saw that the king did not hearken to them, the people answered the king,
2CH.10.16	“What portion have we in David?
2CH.10.16	We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse.
2CH.10.16	Each of you to your tents, O Israel!
2CH.10.16	Look now to your own house, David.”
2CH.10.16	So all Israel departed to their tents. 
2CH.10.17	But Rehoboam reigned over the people of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah. 
2CH.10.18	Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was taskmaster over the forced labor, and the people of Israel stoned him to death with stones. And King Rehoboam made haste to mount his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. 
2CH.10.19	So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
2CH.11.2	But the word of the 
2CH.11.3	“Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, 
2CH.11.4	‘Thus says the 
2CH.11.5	Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and he built cities for defense in Judah. 
2CH.11.6	He built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, 
2CH.11.7	Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam, 
2CH.11.8	Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 
2CH.11.9	Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 
2CH.11.10	Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, fortified cities which are in Judah and in Benjamin. 
2CH.11.11	He made the fortresses strong, and put commanders in them, and stores of food, oil, and wine. 
2CH.11.12	And he put shields and spears in all the cities, and made them very strong. So he held Judah and Benjamin.
2CH.11.13	And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him from all places where they lived. 
2CH.11.14	For the Levites left their common lands and their holdings and came to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons cast them out from serving as priests of the 
2CH.11.15	and he appointed his own priests for the high places, and for the satyrs, and for the calves which he had made. 
2CH.11.16	And those who had set their hearts to seek the 
2CH.11.17	They strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and for three years they made Rehoboam the son of Solomon secure, for they walked for three years in the way of David and Solomon.
2CH.11.18	Rehoboam took as wife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse; 
2CH.11.19	and she bore him sons, Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham. 
2CH.11.20	After her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom, who bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. 
2CH.11.21	Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and concubines (he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and had twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters); 
2CH.11.22	and Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah as chief prince among his brothers, for he intended to make him king. 
2CH.11.23	And he dealt wisely, and distributed some of his sons through all the districts of Judah and Benjamin, in all the fortified cities; and he gave them abundant provisions, and procured wives for them.
2CH.12.2	In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, because they had been unfaithful to the 
2CH.12.3	with twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen. And the people were without number who came with him from Egypt—Libyans, Sukki-im, and Ethiopians. 
2CH.12.4	And he took the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem. 
2CH.12.5	Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and to the princes of Judah, who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, “Thus says the 
2CH.12.6	Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, “The 
2CH.12.7	When the 
2CH.12.8	Nevertheless they shall be servants to him, that they may know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.”
2CH.12.9	So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem; he took away the treasures of the house of the 
2CH.12.10	and King Rehoboam made in their stead shields of bronze, and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard, who kept the door of the king's house. 
2CH.12.11	And as often as the king went into the house of the 
2CH.12.12	And when he humbled himself the wrath of the 
2CH.12.13	So King Rehoboam established himself in Jerusalem and reigned. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the 
2CH.12.14	And he did evil, for he did not set his heart to seek the 
2CH.12.15	Now the acts of Rehoboam, from first to last, are they not written in the chronicles of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer?
2CH.12.16	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David; and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.13.2	He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah.
2CH.13.2	Now there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. 
2CH.13.3	Abijah went out to battle having an army of valiant men of war, four hundred thousand picked men; and Jeroboam drew up his line of battle against him with eight hundred thousand picked mighty warriors. 
2CH.13.4	Then Abijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, “Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel! 
2CH.13.5	Ought you not to know that the 
2CH.13.6	Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his lord; 
2CH.13.7	and certain worthless scoundrels gathered about him and defied Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and irresolute and could not withstand them.
2CH.13.8	“And now you think to withstand the kingdom of the 
2CH.13.9	Have you not driven out the priests of the 
2CH.13.10	But as for us, the 
2CH.13.11	They offer to the 
2CH.13.12	Behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with their battle trumpets to sound the call to battle against you. O sons of Israel, do not fight against the 
2CH.13.13	Jeroboam had sent an ambush around to come on them from behind; thus his troops
2CH.13.14	And when Judah looked, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried to the 
2CH.13.15	Then the men of Judah raised the battle shout. And when the men of Judah shouted, God defeated Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. 
2CH.13.16	The men of Israel fled before Judah, and God gave them into their hand. 
2CH.13.17	Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter; so there fell slain of Israel five hundred thousand picked men. 
2CH.13.18	Thus the men of Israel were subdued at that time, and the men of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the 
2CH.13.19	And Abijah pursued Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with its villages and Jeshanah with its villages and Ephron
2CH.13.20	Jeroboam did not recover his power in the days of Abijah; and the 
2CH.13.21	But Abijah grew mighty. And he took fourteen wives, and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. 
2CH.13.22	The rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways and his sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.
2CH.14.2	 And Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the 
2CH.14.3	He took away the foreign altars and the high places, and broke down the pillars and hewed down the Asherim, 
2CH.14.4	and commanded Judah to seek the 
2CH.14.5	He also took out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the incense altars. And the kingdom had rest under him. 
2CH.14.6	He built fortified cities in Judah, for the land had rest. He had no war in those years, for the 
2CH.14.7	And he said to Judah, “Let us build these cities, and surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars; the land is still ours, because we have sought the 
2CH.14.8	And Asa had an army of three hundred thousand from Judah, armed with bucklers and spears, and two hundred and eighty thousand men from Benjamin, that carried shields and drew bows; all these were mighty men of valor.
2CH.14.9	Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots, and came as far as Mareshah. 
2CH.14.10	And Asa went out to meet him, and they drew up their lines of battle in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. 
2CH.14.11	And Asa cried to the 
2CH.14.12	So the 
2CH.14.13	Asa and the people that were with him pursued them as far as Gerar, and the Ethiopians fell until none remained alive; for they were broken before the 
2CH.14.14	And they smote all the cities round about Gerar, for the fear of the 
2CH.14.15	And they smote the tents of those who had cattle,
2CH.15.1	The Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded, 
2CH.15.2	and he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, “Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: The 
2CH.15.3	For a long time Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law; 
2CH.15.4	but when in their distress they turned to the 
2CH.15.5	In those times there was no peace to him who went out or to him who came in, for great disturbances afflicted all the inhabitants of the lands. 
2CH.15.6	They were broken in pieces, nation against nation and city against city, for God troubled them with every sort of distress. 
2CH.15.7	But you, take courage! Do not let your hands be weak, for your work shall be rewarded.”
2CH.15.8	When Asa heard these words, the prophecy of Azariah the son of Oded,
2CH.15.9	And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who were sojourning with them, for great numbers had deserted to him from Israel when they saw that the 
2CH.15.10	They were gathered at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. 
2CH.15.11	They sacrificed to the 
2CH.15.12	And they entered into a covenant to seek the 
2CH.15.13	and that whoever would not seek the 
2CH.15.14	They took oath to the 
2CH.15.15	And all Judah rejoiced over the oath; for they had sworn with all their heart, and had sought him with their whole desire, and he was found by them, and the 
2CH.15.17	But the high places were not taken out of Israel. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was blameless all his days. 
2CH.15.18	And he brought into the house of God the votive gifts of his father and his own votive gifts, silver, and gold, and vessels. 
2CH.15.19	And there was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.
2CH.16.1	In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might permit no one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 
2CH.16.2	Then Asa took silver and gold from the treasures of the house of the 
2CH.16.3	“Let there be a league between me and you, as between my father and your father; behold, I am sending to you silver and gold; go, break your league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may withdraw from me.” 
2CH.16.4	And Ben-hadad hearkened to King Asa, and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and they conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the store-cities of Naphtali. 
2CH.16.5	And when Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah, and let his work cease. 
2CH.16.6	Then King Asa took all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber, with which Baasha had been building, and with them he built Geba and Mizpah.
2CH.16.7	At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, “Because you relied on the king of Syria, and did not rely on the 
2CH.16.8	Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans a huge army with exceedingly many chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied on the 
2CH.16.9	For the eyes of the 
2CH.16.10	Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the stocks, in prison, for he was in a rage with him because of this. And Asa inflicted cruelties upon some of the people at the same time.
2CH.16.11	The acts of Asa, from first to last, are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.16.12	 In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet, and his disease became severe; yet even in his disease he did not seek the 
2CH.16.13	And Asa slept with his fathers, dying in the forty-first year of his reign. 
2CH.16.14	They buried him in the tomb which he had hewn out for himself in the city of David. They laid him on a bier which had been filled with various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumer's art; and they made a very great fire in his honor.
2CH.17.2	He placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim which Asa his father had taken. 
2CH.17.3	The 
2CH.17.4	but sought the God of his father and walked in his commandments, and not according to the ways of Israel. 
2CH.17.5	Therefore the 
2CH.17.6	His heart was courageous in the ways of the 
2CH.17.7	In the third year of his reign he sent his princes, Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah; 
2CH.17.8	and with them the Levites, Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah; and with these Levites, the priests Elishama and Jehoram. 
2CH.17.9	And they taught in Judah, having the book of the law of the 
2CH.17.10	And the fear of the 
2CH.17.11	Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and silver for tribute; and the Arabs also brought him seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred he-goats. 
2CH.17.12	And Jehoshaphat grew steadily greater. He built in Judah fortresses and store-cities, 
2CH.17.13	and he had great stores in the cities of Judah. He had soldiers, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem. 
2CH.17.14	This was the muster of them by fathers' houses: Of Judah, the commanders of thousands: Adnah the commander, with three hundred thousand mighty men of valor, 
2CH.17.15	and next to him Jehohanan the commander, with two hundred and eighty thousand, 
2CH.17.16	and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, a volunteer for the service of the 
2CH.17.17	Of Benjamin: Eliada, a mighty man of valor, with two hundred thousand men armed with bow and shield, 
2CH.17.18	and next to him Jehozabad with a hundred and eighty thousand armed for war. 
2CH.17.19	These were in the service of the king, besides those whom the king had placed in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.
2CH.18.2	After some years he went down to Ahab in Samaria. And Ahab killed an abundance of sheep and oxen for him and for the people who were with him, and induced him to go up against Ramoth-gilead. 
2CH.18.3	Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead?” He answered him, “I am as you are, my people as your people. We will be with you in the war.”
2CH.18.4	And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Inquire first for the word of the 
2CH.18.5	Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall we go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I forbear?” And they said, “Go up; for God will give it into the hand of the king.” 
2CH.18.6	But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not here another prophet of the 
2CH.18.7	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the 
2CH.18.8	Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, “Bring quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.” 
2CH.18.9	Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes; and they were sitting at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them. 
2CH.18.10	And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron, and said, “Thus says the 
2CH.18.11	And all the prophets prophesied so, and said, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and triumph; the 
2CH.18.12	And the messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him, “Behold, the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king; let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably.” 
2CH.18.13	But Micaiah said, “As the 
2CH.18.14	And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?” And he answered, “Go up and triumph; they will be given into your hand.” 
2CH.18.15	But the king said to him, “How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the 
2CH.18.16	And he said, “I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd; and the 
2CH.18.17	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?” 
2CH.18.18	And Micaiah said, “Therefore hear the word of the 
2CH.18.19	and the 
2CH.18.20	Then a spirit came forward and stood before the 
2CH.18.21	And he said, ‘I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ And he said, ‘You are to entice him, and you shall succeed; go forth and do so.’ 
2CH.18.22	Now therefore behold, the 
2CH.18.23	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, “Which way did the Spirit of the 
2CH.18.24	And Micaiah said, “Behold, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.” 
2CH.18.25	And the king of Israel said, “Seize Micaiah, and take him back to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king's son; 
2CH.18.26	and say, ‘Thus says the king, Put this fellow in prison, and feed him with scant fare of bread and water, until I return in peace.’ ” 
2CH.18.27	And Micaiah said, “If you return in peace, the 
2CH.18.28	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. 
2CH.18.29	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your robes.” And the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into battle. 
2CH.18.30	Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, “Fight with neither small nor great, but only with the king of Israel.” 
2CH.18.31	And when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “It is the king of Israel.” So they turned to fight against him; and Jehoshaphat cried out, and the 
2CH.18.32	for when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him. 
2CH.18.33	But a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and struck the king of Israel between the scale armor and the breastplate; therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn about, and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded.” 
2CH.18.34	And the battle grew hot that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Syrians until evening; then at sunset he died.
2CH.19.1	Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned in safety to his house in Jerusalem. 
2CH.19.2	But Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to King Jehoshaphat, “Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the 
2CH.19.3	Nevertheless some good is found in you, for you destroyed the Asherahs out of the land, and have set your heart to seek God.”
2CH.19.4	Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem; and he went out again among the people, from Beer-sheba to the hill country of Ephraim, and brought them back to the 
2CH.19.5	He appointed judges in the land in all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city, 
2CH.19.6	and said to the judges, “Consider what you do, for you judge not for man but for the 
2CH.19.7	Now then, let the fear of the 
2CH.19.8	Moreover in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat appointed certain Levites and priests and heads of families of Israel, to give judgment for the 
2CH.19.9	And he charged them: “Thus you shall do in the fear of the 
2CH.19.10	whenever a case comes to you from your brethren who live in their cities, concerning bloodshed, law or commandment, statutes or ordinances, then you shall instruct them, that they may not incur guilt before the 
2CH.19.11	And behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the 
2CH.20.1	After this the Moabites and Ammonites, and with them some of the Me-unites,
2CH.20.2	Some men came and told Jehoshaphat, “A great multitude is coming against you from Edom,
2CH.20.3	Then Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the 
2CH.20.4	And Judah assembled to seek help from the 
2CH.20.5	And Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the 
2CH.20.6	and said, “O 
2CH.20.7	 Didst thou not, O our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and give it for ever to the descendants of Abraham thy friend? 
2CH.20.8	And they have dwelt in it, and have built thee in it a sanctuary for thy name, saying, 
2CH.20.9	‘If evil comes upon us, the sword, judgment,
2CH.20.10	And now behold, the men of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade when they came from the land of Egypt, and whom they avoided and did not destroy— 
2CH.20.11	behold, they reward us by coming to drive us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit. 
2CH.20.12	O our God, wilt thou not execute judgment upon them? For we are powerless against this great multitude that is coming against us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are upon thee.”
2CH.20.13	Meanwhile all the men of Judah stood before the 
2CH.20.14	And the Spirit of the 
2CH.20.15	And he said, “Hearken, all Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, and King Jehoshaphat: Thus says the 
2CH.20.16	Tomorrow go down against them; behold, they will come up by the ascent of Ziz; you will find them at the end of the valley, east of the wilderness of Jeruel. 
2CH.20.17	You will not need to fight in this battle; take your position, stand still, and see the victory of the 
2CH.20.18	Then Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the 
2CH.20.19	And the Levites, of the Kohathites and the Korahites, stood up to praise the 
2CH.20.20	And they rose early in the morning and went out into the wilderness of Tekoa; and as they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Hear me, Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem! Believe in the 
2CH.20.21	And when he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed those who were to sing to the 
2CH.20.21	“Give thanks to the 
2CH.20.21	for his steadfast love endures for ever.”
2CH.20.22	And when they began to sing and praise, the 
2CH.20.23	For the men of Ammon and Moab rose against the inhabitants of Mount Seir, destroying them utterly, and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, they all helped to destroy one another.
2CH.20.24	When Judah came to the watchtower of the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude; and behold, they were dead bodies lying on the ground; none had escaped. 
2CH.20.25	When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take the spoil from them, they found cattle
2CH.20.26	On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Beracah,
2CH.20.27	Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat at their head, returning to Jerusalem with joy, for the 
2CH.20.28	They came to Jerusalem, with harps and lyres and trumpets, to the house of the 
2CH.20.29	And the fear of God came on all the kingdoms of the countries when they heard that the 
2CH.20.30	So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest round about.
2CH.20.32	He walked in the way of Asa his father and did not turn aside from it; he did what was right in the sight of the 
2CH.20.33	The high places, however, were not taken away; the people had not yet set their hearts upon the God of their fathers.
2CH.20.34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, from first to last, are written in the chronicles of Jehu the son of Hanani, which are recorded in the Book of the Kings of Israel.
2CH.20.36	He joined him in building ships to go to Tarshish, and they built the ships in Ezion-geber. 
2CH.20.37	Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because you have joined with Ahaziah, the 
2CH.21.2	He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Judah. 
2CH.21.3	Their father gave them great gifts, of silver, gold, and valuable possessions, together with fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, because he was the first-born. 
2CH.21.4	When Jehoram had ascended the throne of his father and was established, he slew all his brothers with the sword, and also some of the princes of Israel. 
2CH.21.5	 Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.21.6	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done; for the daughter of Ahab was his wife. And he did what was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.21.7	Yet the 
2CH.21.8	In his days Edom revolted from the rule of Judah, and set up a king of their own. 
2CH.21.9	Then Jehoram passed over with his commanders and all his chariots, and he rose by night and smote the Edomites who had surrounded him and his chariot commanders. 
2CH.21.10	So Edom revolted from the rule of Judah to this day. At that time Libnah also revolted from his rule, because he had forsaken the 
2CH.21.11	Moreover he made high places in the hill country of Judah, and led the inhabitants of Jerusalem into unfaithfulness, and made Judah go astray. 
2CH.21.12	And a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, “Thus says the 
2CH.21.13	but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem into unfaithfulness, as the house of Ahab led Israel into unfaithfulness, and also you have killed your brothers, of your father's house, who were better than yourself; 
2CH.21.14	behold, the 
2CH.21.15	and you yourself will have a severe sickness with a disease of your bowels, until your bowels come out because of the disease, day by day.’ ”
2CH.21.16	And the 
2CH.21.17	and they came up against Judah, and invaded it, and carried away all the possessions they found that belonged to the king's house, and also his sons and his wives, so that no son was left to him except Jehoahaz, his youngest son.
2CH.21.18	And after all this the 
2CH.21.19	In course of time, at the end of two years, his bowels came out because of the disease, and he died in great agony. His people made no fire in his honor, like the fires made for his fathers. 
2CH.21.20	 He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem; and he departed with no one's regret. They buried him in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
2CH.22.2	Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah, the granddaughter of Omri. 
2CH.22.3	He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counselor in doing wickedly. 
2CH.22.4	He did what was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.22.5	He even followed their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to make war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead. And the Syrians wounded Joram, 
2CH.22.6	and he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which he had received at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
2CH.22.8	And when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, he met the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah's brothers, who attended Ahaziah, and he killed them. 
2CH.22.9	He searched for Ahaziah, and he was captured while hiding in Samaria, and he was brought to Jehu and put to death. They buried him, for they said, “He is the grandson of Jehoshaphat, who sought the 
2CH.22.11	But Jeho-shabe-ath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king's sons who were about to be slain, and she put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. Thus Jeho-shabe-ath, the daughter of King Jehoram and wife of Jehoiada the priest, because she was a sister of Ahaziah, hid him from Athaliah, so that she did not slay him; 
2CH.22.12	and he remained with them six years, hid in the house of God, while Athaliah reigned over the land.
2CH.23.1	But in the seventh year Jehoiada took courage, and entered into a compact with the commanders of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Ma-aseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri. 
2CH.23.2	And they went about through Judah and gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah, and the heads of fathers' houses of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem. 
2CH.23.3	And all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And Jehoiada
2CH.23.4	This is the thing that you shall do: of you priests and Levites who come off duty on the sabbath, one third shall be gatekeepers, 
2CH.23.5	and one third shall be at the king's house and one third at the Gate of the Foundation; and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the 
2CH.23.6	Let no one enter the house of the 
2CH.23.7	The Levites shall surround the king, each with his weapons in his hand; and whoever enters the house shall be slain. Be with the king when he comes in, and when he goes out.”
2CH.23.8	The Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. They each brought his men, who were to go off duty on the sabbath, with those who were to come on duty on the sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest did not dismiss the divisions. 
2CH.23.9	And Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains the spears and the large and small shields that had been King David's, which were in the house of God; 
2CH.23.10	and he set all the people as a guard for the king, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the south side of the house to the north side of the house, around the altar and the house. 
2CH.23.11	Then he brought out the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony; and they proclaimed him king, and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and they said, “Long live the king.”
2CH.23.12	When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she went into the house of the 
2CH.23.13	and when she looked, there was the king standing by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpeters beside the king, and all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets, and the singers with their musical instruments leading in the celebration. And Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, “Treason! Treason!” 
2CH.23.14	Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains who were set over the army, saying to them, “Bring her out between the ranks; any one who follows her is to be slain with the sword.” For the priest said, “Do not slay her in the house of the 
2CH.23.15	So they laid hands on her; and she went into the entrance of the horse gate of the king's house, and they slew her there.
2CH.23.16	And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself and all the people and the king that they should be the 
2CH.23.17	Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and tore it down; his altars and his images they broke in pieces, and they slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. 
2CH.23.18	And Jehoiada posted watchmen for the house of the 
2CH.23.19	He stationed the gatekeepers at the gates of the house of the 
2CH.23.20	And he took the captains, the nobles, the governors of the people, and all the people of the land; and they brought the king down from the house of the 
2CH.23.21	So all the people of the land rejoiced; and the city was quiet, after Athaliah had been slain with the sword.
2CH.24.2	And Joash did what was right in the eyes of the 
2CH.24.3	Jehoiada got for him two wives, and he had sons and daughters.
2CH.24.4	After this Joash decided to restore the house of the 
2CH.24.5	And he gathered the priests and the Levites, and said to them, “Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year; and see that you hasten the matter.” But the Levites did not hasten it. 
2CH.24.6	So the king summoned Jehoiada the chief, and said to him, “Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax levied by Moses, the servant of the 
2CH.24.7	For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken into the house of God; and had also used all the dedicated things of the house of the 
2CH.24.8	So the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it outside the gate of the house of the 
2CH.24.9	And proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for the 
2CH.24.10	And all the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought their tax and dropped it into the chest until they had finished. 
2CH.24.11	And whenever the chest was brought to the king's officers by the Levites, when they saw that there was much money in it, the king's secretary and the officer of the chief priest would come and empty the chest and take it and return it to its place. Thus they did day after day, and collected money in abundance. 
2CH.24.12	And the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who had charge of the work of the house of the 
2CH.24.13	So those who were engaged in the work labored, and the repairing went forward in their hands, and they restored the house of God to its proper condition and strengthened it. 
2CH.24.14	And when they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, and with it were made utensils for the house of the 
2CH.24.15	But Jehoiada grew old and full of days, and died; he was a hundred and thirty years old at his death. 
2CH.24.16	And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward God and his house.
2CH.24.17	Now after the death of Jehoiada the princes of Judah came and did obeisance to the king; then the king harkened to them. 
2CH.24.18	And they forsook the house of the 
2CH.24.19	Yet he sent prophets among them to bring them back to the 
2CH.24.20	Then the Spirit of God took possession of
2CH.24.21	But they conspired against him, and by command of the king they stoned him with stones in the court of the house of the 
2CH.24.22	Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which Jehoiada, Zechariah's father, had shown him, but killed his son. And when he was dying, he said, “May the 
2CH.24.24	Though the army of the Syrians had come with few men, the 
2CH.24.25	When they had departed from him, leaving him severely wounded, his servants conspired against him because of the blood of the son
2CH.24.26	Those who conspired against him were Zabad the son of Shime-ath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess. 
2CH.24.27	Accounts of his sons, and of the many oracles against him, and of the rebuilding
2CH.25.2	And he did what was right in the eyes of the 
2CH.25.3	And as soon as the royal power was firmly in his hand he killed his servants who had slain the king his father. 
2CH.25.4	But he did not put their children to death, according to what is written in the law, in the book of Moses, where the 
2CH.25.5	Then Amaziah assembled the men of Judah, and set them by fathers' houses under commanders of thousands and of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He mustered those twenty years old and upward, and found that they were three hundred thousand picked men, fit for war, able to handle spear and shield. 
2CH.25.6	He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valor from Israel for a hundred talents of silver. 
2CH.25.7	But a man of God came to him and said, “O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for the 
2CH.25.8	But if you suppose that in this way you will be strong for war,
2CH.25.9	And Amaziah said to the man of God, “But what shall we do about the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?” The man of God answered, “The 
2CH.25.10	Then Amaziah discharged the army that had come to him from Ephraim, to go home again. And they became very angry with Judah, and returned home in fierce anger. 
2CH.25.11	 But Amaziah took courage, and led out his people, and went to the Valley of Salt and smote ten thousand men of Seir. 
2CH.25.12	The men of Judah captured another ten thousand alive, and took them to the top of a rock and threw them down from the top of the rock; and they were all dashed to pieces. 
2CH.25.13	But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, not letting them go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria to Beth-horon, and killed three thousand people in them, and took much spoil.
2CH.25.14	After Amaziah came from the slaughter of the Edomites, he brought the gods of the men of Seir, and set them up as his gods, and worshiped them, making offerings to them. 
2CH.25.15	Therefore the 
2CH.25.16	But as he was speaking the king said to him, “Have we made you a royal counselor? Stop! Why should you be put to death?” So the prophet stopped, but said, “I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel.”
2CH.25.18	And Joash the king of Israel sent word to Amaziah king of Judah, “A thistle on Lebanon sent to a cedar on Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son for a wife’; and a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thistle. 
2CH.25.19	You say, ‘See, I have smitten Edom,’ and your heart has lifted you up in boastfulness. But now stay at home; why should you provoke trouble so that you fall, you and Judah with you?”
2CH.25.20	But Amaziah would not listen; for it was of God, in order that he might give them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought the gods of Edom. 
2CH.25.21	So Joash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another in battle at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah. 
2CH.25.22	And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his home. 
2CH.25.23	And Joash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem for four hundred cubits, from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate. 
2CH.25.24	And he seized all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God, and Obed-edom with them; he seized also the treasuries of the king's house, and hostages, and he returned to Samaria.
2CH.25.26	Now the rest of the deeds of Amaziah, from first to last, are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel? 
2CH.25.27	From the time when he turned away from the 
2CH.25.28	And they brought him upon horses; and he was buried with his fathers in the city of David.
2CH.26.2	He built Eloth and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers. 
2CH.26.3	Uzziah was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. 
2CH.26.4	And he did what was right in the eyes of the 
2CH.26.5	He set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God; and as long as he sought the 
2CH.26.6	He went out and made war against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in the territory of Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines. 
2CH.26.7	God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabs that dwelt in Gurbaal, and against the Me-unites. 
2CH.26.8	The Ammonites paid tribute to Uzziah, and his fame spread even to the border of Egypt, for he became very strong. 
2CH.26.9	Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate and at the Valley Gate and at the Angle, and fortified them. 
2CH.26.10	And he built towers in the wilderness, and hewed out many cisterns, for he had large herds, both in the Shephelah and in the plain, and he had farmers and vinedressers in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil. 
2CH.26.11	Moreover Uzziah had an army of soldiers, fit for war, in divisions according to the numbers in the muster made by Je-iel the secretary and Ma-aseiah the officer, under the direction of Hananiah, one of the king's commanders. 
2CH.26.12	The whole number of the heads of fathers' houses of mighty men of valor was two thousand six hundred. 
2CH.26.13	Under their command was an army of three hundred and seven thousand five hundred, who could make war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy. 
2CH.26.14	And Uzziah prepared for all the army shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows, and stones for slinging. 
2CH.26.15	In Jerusalem he made engines, invented by skilful men, to be on the towers and the corners, to shoot arrows and great stones. And his fame spread far, for he was marvelously helped, till he was strong.
2CH.26.16	But when he was strong he grew proud, to his destruction. For he was false to the 
2CH.26.17	But Azariah the priest went in after him, with eighty priests of the 
2CH.26.18	and they withstood King Uzziah, and said to him, “It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the 
2CH.26.19	Then Uzziah was angry. Now he had a censer in his hand to burn incense, and when he became angry with the priests leprosy broke out on his forehead, in the presence of the priests in the house of the 
2CH.26.20	 And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked at him, and behold, he was leprous in his forehead! And they thrust him out quickly, and he himself hastened to go out, because the 
2CH.26.21	And King Uzziah was a leper to the day of his death, and being a leper dwelt in a separate house, for he was excluded from the house of the 
2CH.26.22	Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from first to last, Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz wrote. 
2CH.26.23	And Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the burial field which belonged to the kings, for they said, “He is a leper.” And Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.27.2	And he did what was right in the eyes of the 
2CH.27.3	He built the upper gate of the house of the 
2CH.27.4	Moreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and forts and towers on the wooded hills. 
2CH.27.5	He fought with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed against them. And the Ammonites gave him that year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand cors of wheat and ten thousand of barley. The Ammonites paid him the same amount in the second and the third years. 
2CH.27.6	So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before the 
2CH.27.7	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. 
2CH.27.8	He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.27.9	 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.28.2	but walked in the ways of the kings of Israel. He even made molten images for the Baals; 
2CH.28.3	and he burned incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burned his sons as an offering, according to the abominable practices of the nations whom the 
2CH.28.4	And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
2CH.28.5	Therefore the 
2CH.28.6	For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew a hundred and twenty thousand in Judah in one day, all of them men of valor, because they had forsaken the 
2CH.28.7	And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Ma-aseiah the king's son and Azrikam the commander of the palace and Elkanah the next in authority to the king.
2CH.28.8	The men of Israel took captive two hundred thousand of their kinsfolk, women, sons, and daughters; they also took much spoil from them and brought the spoil to Samaria. 
2CH.28.9	But a prophet of the 
2CH.28.10	And now you intend to subjugate the people of Judah and Jerusalem, male and female, as your slaves. Have you not sins of your own against the 
2CH.28.11	Now hear me, and send back the captives from your kinsfolk whom you have taken, for the fierce wrath of the 
2CH.28.12	Certain chiefs also of the men of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who were coming from the war, 
2CH.28.13	and said to them, “You shall not bring the captives in here, for you propose to bring upon us guilt against the 
2CH.28.14	So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly. 
2CH.28.15	And the men who have been mentioned by name rose and took the captives, and with the spoil they clothed all that were naked among them; they clothed them, gave them sandals, provided them with food and drink, and anointed them; and carrying all the feeble among them on asses, they brought them to their kinsfolk at Jericho, the city of palm trees. Then they returned to Samaria.
2CH.28.16	At that time King Ahaz sent to the king
2CH.28.17	For the Edomites had again invaded and defeated Judah, and carried away captives. 
2CH.28.18	And the Philistines had made raids on the cities in the Shephelah and the Negeb of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages; and they settled there. 
2CH.28.19	For the 
2CH.28.20	So Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came against him, and afflicted him instead of strengthening him. 
2CH.28.21	For Ahaz took from the house of the 
2CH.28.22	In the time of his distress he became yet more faithless to the 
2CH.28.23	For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which had defeated him, and said, “Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, I will sacrifice to them that they may help me.” But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel. 
2CH.28.24	And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and he shut up the doors of the house of the 
2CH.28.25	In every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, provoking to anger the 
2CH.28.26	Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.28.27	 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem, for they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.29.2	And he did what was right in the eyes of the 
2CH.29.3	In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the 
2CH.29.4	He brought in the priests and the Levites, and assembled them in the square on the east, 
2CH.29.5	and said to them, “Hear me, Levites! Now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of the 
2CH.29.6	For our fathers have been unfaithful and have done what was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.29.7	They also shut the doors of the vestibule and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel. 
2CH.29.8	Therefore the wrath of the 
2CH.29.9	For lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this. 
2CH.29.10	Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the 
2CH.29.11	My sons, do not now be negligent, for the 
2CH.29.12	Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah; 
2CH.29.13	and of the sons of Eli-zaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah; 
2CH.29.14	and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shime-i; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel. 
2CH.29.15	They gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and went in as the king had commanded, by the words of the 
2CH.29.16	The priests went into the inner part of the house of the 
2CH.29.17	They began to sanctify on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the vestibule of the 
2CH.29.18	Then they went in to Hezekiah the king and said, “We have cleansed all the house of the 
2CH.29.19	All the utensils which King Ahaz discarded in his reign when he was faithless, we have made ready and sanctified; and behold, they are before the altar of the 
2CH.29.20	Then Hezekiah the king rose early and gathered the officials of the city, and went up to the house of the 
2CH.29.21	And they brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven he-goats for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the 
2CH.29.22	So they killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood and threw it against the altar; and they killed the rams and their blood was thrown against the altar; and they killed the lambs and their blood was thrown against the altar. 
2CH.29.23	Then the he-goats for the sin offering were brought to the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands upon them, 
2CH.29.24	and the priests killed them and made a sin offering with their blood on the altar, to make atonement for all Israel. For the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel.
2CH.29.25	And he stationed the Levites in the house of the 
2CH.29.26	The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets. 
2CH.29.27	Then Hezekiah commanded that the burnt offering be offered on the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song to the 
2CH.29.28	The whole assembly worshiped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this continued until the burnt offering was finished. 
2CH.29.29	When the offering was finished, the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped. 
2CH.29.30	And Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises to the 
2CH.29.31	Then Hezekiah said, “You have now consecrated yourselves to the 
2CH.29.32	The number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all these were for a burnt offering to the 
2CH.29.33	And the consecrated offerings were six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep. 
2CH.29.34	But the priests were too few and could not flay all the burnt offerings, so until other priests had sanctified themselves their brethren the Levites helped them, until the work was finished—for the Levites were more upright in heart than the priests in sanctifying themselves. 
2CH.29.35	Besides the great number of burnt offerings there was the fat of the peace offerings, and there were the libations for the burnt offerings. Thus the service of the house of the 
2CH.29.36	And Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced because of what God had done for the people; for the thing came about suddenly.
2CH.30.1	Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the 
2CH.30.2	For the king and his princes and all the assembly in Jerusalem had taken counsel to keep the passover in the second month— 
2CH.30.3	for they could not keep it in its time because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, nor had the people assembled in Jerusalem— 
2CH.30.4	and the plan seemed right to the king and all the assembly. 
2CH.30.5	So they decreed to make a proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba to Dan, that the people should come and keep the passover to the 
2CH.30.6	So couriers went throughout all Israel and Judah with letters from the king and his princes, as the king had commanded, saying, “O people of Israel, return to the 
2CH.30.7	Do not be like your fathers and your brethren, who were faithless to the 
2CH.30.8	Do not now be stiff-necked as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to the 
2CH.30.9	For if you return to the 
2CH.30.10	So the couriers went from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, and as far as Zebulun; but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them. 
2CH.30.11	Only a few men of Asher, of Manasseh, and of Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.12	The hand of God was also upon Judah to give them one heart to do what the king and the princes commanded by the word of the 
2CH.30.13	And many people came together in Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly. 
2CH.30.14	They set to work and removed the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for burning incense they took away and threw into the Kidron valley. 
2CH.30.15	And they killed the passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. And the priests and the Levites were put to shame, so that they sanctified themselves, and brought burnt offerings into the house of the 
2CH.30.16	They took their accustomed posts according to the law of Moses the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood which they received from the hand of the Levites. 
2CH.30.17	For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves; therefore the Levites had to kill the passover lamb for every one who was not clean, to make it holy to the 
2CH.30.18	For a multitude of the people, many of them from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the passover otherwise than as prescribed. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, “The good 
2CH.30.19	who sets his heart to seek God, the 
2CH.30.20	And the 
2CH.30.21	And the people of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised the 
2CH.30.22	And Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who showed good skill in the service of the 
2CH.30.23	Then the whole assembly agreed together to keep the feast for another seven days; so they kept it for another seven days with gladness. 
2CH.30.24	For Hezekiah king of Judah gave the assembly a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep for offerings, and the princes gave the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep. And the priests sanctified themselves in great numbers. 
2CH.30.25	The whole assembly of Judah, and the priests and the Levites, and the whole assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners who came out of the land of Israel, and the sojourners who dwelt in Judah, rejoiced. 
2CH.30.26	So there was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.27	Then the priests and the Levites arose and blessed the people, and their voice was heard, and their prayer came to his holy habitation in heaven.
2CH.31.1	Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah and broke in pieces the pillars and hewed down the Asherim and broke down the high places and the altars throughout all Judah and Benjamin, and in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the people of Israel returned to their cities, every man to his possession.
2CH.31.2	And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and of the Levites, division by division, each according to his service, the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and peace offerings, to minister in the gates of the camp of the 
2CH.31.3	The contribution of the king from his own possessions was for the burnt offerings: the burnt offerings of morning and evening, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, the new moons, and the appointed feasts, as it is written in the law of the 
2CH.31.4	And he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion due to the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the law of the 
2CH.31.5	As soon as the command was spread abroad, the people of Israel gave in abundance the first fruits of grain, wine, oil, honey, and of all the produce of the field; and they brought in abundantly the tithe of everything. 
2CH.31.6	And the people of Israel and Judah who lived in the cities of Judah also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep, and the dedicated things
2CH.31.7	In the third month they began to pile up the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month. 
2CH.31.8	When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the 
2CH.31.9	And Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites about the heaps. 
2CH.31.10	Azariah the chief priest, who was of the house of Zadok, answered him, “Since they began to bring the contributions into the house of the 
2CH.31.11	Then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare chambers in the house of the 
2CH.31.12	And they faithfully brought in the contributions, the tithes and the dedicated things. The chief officer in charge of them was Conaniah the Levite, with Shime-i his brother as second; 
2CH.31.13	while Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers assisting Conaniah and Shime-i his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the chief officer of the house of God. 
2CH.31.14	And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, keeper of the east gate, was over the freewill offerings to God, to apportion the contribution reserved for the 
2CH.31.15	Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah were faithfully assisting him in the cities of the priests, to distribute the portions to their brethren, old and young alike, by divisions, 
2CH.31.16	except those enrolled by genealogy, males from three years old and upwards, all who entered the house of the 
2CH.31.17	The enrollment of the priests was according to their fathers' houses; that of the Levites from twenty years old and upwards was according to their offices, by their divisions. 
2CH.31.18	The priests were enrolled with all their little children, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, the whole multitude; for they were faithful in keeping themselves holy. 
2CH.31.19	And for the sons of Aaron, the priests, who were in the fields of common land belonging to their cities, there were men in the several cities who were designated by name to distribute portions to every male among the priests and to every one among the Levites who was enrolled.
2CH.31.20	Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah; and he did what was good and right and faithful before the 
2CH.31.21	And every work that he undertook in the service of the house of God and in accordance with the law and the commandments, seeking his God, he did with all his heart, and prospered.
2CH.32.2	And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and intended to fight against Jerusalem, 
2CH.32.3	he planned with his officers and his mighty men to stop the water of the springs that were outside the city; and they helped him. 
2CH.32.4	A great many people were gathered, and they stopped all the springs and the brook that flowed through the land, saying, “Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water?” 
2CH.32.5	He set to work resolutely and built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised towers upon it,
2CH.32.6	And he set combat commanders over the people, and gathered them together to him in the square at the gate of the city and spoke encouragingly to them, saying, 
2CH.32.7	“Be strong and of good courage. Do not be afraid or dismayed before the king of Assyria and all the horde that is with him; for there is one greater with us than with him. 
2CH.32.8	With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the 
2CH.32.10	“Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria, ‘On what are you relying, that you stand siege in Jerusalem? 
2CH.32.11	Is not Hezekiah misleading you, that he may give you over to die by famine and by thirst, when he tells you, “The 
2CH.32.12	Has not this same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, “Before one altar you shall worship, and upon it you shall burn your sacrifices”? 
2CH.32.13	Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of other lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands at all able to deliver their lands out of my hand? 
2CH.32.14	Who among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed was able to deliver his people from my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you from my hand? 
2CH.32.15	Now therefore do not let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you in this fashion, and do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or from the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand!’ ”
2CH.32.16	And his servants said still more against the Lord 
2CH.32.17	And he wrote letters to cast contempt on the 
2CH.32.18	And they shouted it with a loud voice in the language of Judah to the people of Jerusalem who were upon the wall, to frighten and terrify them, in order that they might take the city. 
2CH.32.19	And they spoke of the God of Jerusalem as they spoke of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men's hands.
2CH.32.20	Then Hezekiah the king and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, prayed because of this and cried to heaven. 
2CH.32.21	And the 
2CH.32.22	So the 
2CH.32.23	And many brought gifts to the 
2CH.32.25	But Hezekiah did not make return according to the benefit done to him, for his heart was proud. Therefore wrath came upon him and Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.32.26	But Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the 
2CH.32.27	And Hezekiah had very great riches and honor; and he made for himself treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all kinds of costly vessels; 
2CH.32.28	storehouses also for the yield of grain, wine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of cattle, and sheepfolds. 
2CH.32.29	He likewise provided cities for himself, and flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very great possessions. 
2CH.32.30	This same Hezekiah closed the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon and directed them down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works. 
2CH.32.31	And so in the matter of the envoys of the princes of Babylon, who had been sent to him to inquire about the sign that had been done in the land, God left him to himself, in order to try him and to know all that was in his heart.
2CH.32.32	Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.32.33	And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the tombs of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.33.2	He did what was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.33.3	For he rebuilt the high places which his father Hezekiah had broken down, and erected altars to the Baals, and made Asherahs, and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served them. 
2CH.33.4	And he built altars in the house of the 
2CH.33.5	And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the 
2CH.33.6	And he burned his sons as an offering in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and practiced soothsaying and augury and sorcery, and dealt with mediums and with wizards. He did much evil in the sight of the 
2CH.33.7	And the image of the idol which he had made he set in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name for ever; 
2CH.33.8	and I will no more remove the foot of Israel from the land which I appointed for your fathers, if only they will be careful to do all that I have commanded them, all the law, the statutes, and the ordinances given through Moses.” 
2CH.33.9	Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did more evil than the nations whom the 
2CH.33.10	The 
2CH.33.11	Therefore the 
2CH.33.12	And when he was in distress he entreated the favor of the 
2CH.33.13	He prayed to him, and God received his entreaty and heard his supplication and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the 
2CH.33.14	Afterwards he built an outer wall for the city of David west of Gihon, in the valley, and for the entrance into the Fish Gate, and carried it round Ophel, and raised it to a very great height; he also put commanders of the army in all the fortified cities in Judah. 
2CH.33.15	And he took away the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the 
2CH.33.16	He also restored the altar of the 
2CH.33.17	Nevertheless the people still sacrificed at the high places, but only to the 
2CH.33.18	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the 
2CH.33.19	And his prayer, and how God received his entreaty, and all his sin and his faithlessness, and the sites on which he built high places and set up the Asherim and the images, before he humbled himself, behold, they are written in the Chronicles of the Seers.
2CH.33.20	 So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his house; and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.33.22	He did what was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.33.23	And he did not humble himself before the 
2CH.33.24	And his servants conspired against him and killed him in his house. 
2CH.33.25	But the people of the land slew all those who had conspired against King Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
2CH.34.2	He did what was right in the eyes of the 
2CH.34.3	 For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet a boy, he began to seek the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the Asherim, and the graven and the molten images. 
2CH.34.4	And they broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence; and he hewed down the incense altars which stood above them; and he broke in pieces the Asherim and the graven and the molten images, and he made dust of them and strewed it over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them. 
2CH.34.5	He also burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.6	And in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, and as far as Naphtali, in their ruins
2CH.34.7	he broke down the altars, and beat the Asherim and the images into powder, and hewed down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.34.9	They came to Hilkiah the high priest and delivered the money that had been brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had collected from Manasseh and Ephraim and from all the remnant of Israel and from all Judah and Benjamin and from the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.10	They delivered it to the workmen who had the oversight of the house of the 
2CH.34.11	They gave it to the carpenters and the builders to buy quarried stone, and timber for binders and beams for the buildings which the kings of Judah had let go to ruin. 
2CH.34.12	And the men did the work faithfully. Over them were set Jahath and Obadiah the Levites, of the sons of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to have oversight. The Levites, all who were skilful with instruments of music, 
2CH.34.13	were over the burden bearers and directed all who did work in every kind of service; and some of the Levites were scribes, and officials, and gatekeepers.
2CH.34.14	While they were bringing out the money that had been brought into the house of the 
2CH.34.15	Then Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the 
2CH.34.16	Shaphan brought the book to the king, and further reported to the king, “All that was committed to your servants they are doing. 
2CH.34.17	They have emptied out the money that was found in the house of the 
2CH.34.18	Then Shaphan the secretary told the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read it before the king.
2CH.34.19	When the king heard the words of the law he rent his clothes. 
2CH.34.20	And the king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the secretary, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying, 
2CH.34.21	“Go, inquire of the 
2CH.34.22	So Hilkiah and those whom the king had sent
2CH.34.23	And she said to them, “Thus says the 
2CH.34.24	Thus says the 
2CH.34.25	Because they have forsaken me and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands, therefore my wrath will be poured out upon this place and will not be quenched. 
2CH.34.26	But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the 
2CH.34.27	because your heart was penitent and you humbled yourself before God when you heard his words against this place and its inhabitants, and you have humbled yourself before me, and have rent your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you, says the 
2CH.34.28	Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place and its inhabitants.’ ” And they brought back word to the king.
2CH.34.29	Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.30	And the king went up to the house of the 
2CH.34.31	And the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the 
2CH.34.32	Then he made all who were present in Jerusalem and in Benjamin stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers. 
2CH.34.33	And Josiah took away all the abominations from all the territory that belonged to the people of Israel, and made all who were in Israel serve the 
2CH.35.2	He appointed the priests to their offices and encouraged them in the service of the house of the 
2CH.35.3	And he said to the Levites who taught all Israel and who were holy to the 
2CH.35.4	Prepare yourselves according to your fathers' houses by your divisions, following the directions of David king of Israel and the directions of Solomon his son. 
2CH.35.5	And stand in the holy place according to the groupings of the fathers' houses of your brethren the lay people, and let there be for each a part of a father's house of the Levites.
2CH.35.6	And kill the passover lamb, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brethren, to do according to the word of the 
2CH.35.7	Then Josiah contributed to the lay people, as passover offerings for all that were present, lambs and kids from the flock to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bulls; these were from the king's possessions. 
2CH.35.8	And his princes contributed willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the chief officers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the passover offerings two thousand six hundred lambs and kids and three hundred bulls. 
2CH.35.9	Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel his brothers, and Hashabiah and Je-iel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the passover offerings five thousand lambs and kids and five hundred bulls.
2CH.35.10	When the service had been prepared for, the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their divisions according to the king's command. 
2CH.35.11	And they killed the passover lamb, and the priests sprinkled the blood which they received from them while the Levites flayed the victims. 
2CH.35.12	And they set aside the burnt offerings that they might distribute them according to the groupings of the fathers' houses of the lay people, to offer to the 
2CH.35.13	And they roasted the passover lamb with fire according to the ordinance; and they boiled the holy offerings in pots, in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the lay people. 
2CH.35.14	And afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering the burnt offerings and the fat parts until night; so the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of Aaron. 
2CH.35.15	The singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their place according to the command of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the gatekeepers were at each gate; they did not need to depart from their service, for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
2CH.35.16	So all the service of the 
2CH.35.17	And the people of Israel who were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days. 
2CH.35.18	No passover like it had been kept in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet; none of the kings of Israel had kept such a passover as was kept by Josiah, and the priests and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
2CH.35.19	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this passover was kept.
2CH.35.20	After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates and Josiah went out against him. 
2CH.35.21	But he sent envoys to him, saying, “What have we to do with each other, king of Judah? I am not coming against you this day, but against the house with which I am at war; and God has commanded me to make haste. Cease opposing God, who is with me, lest he destroy you.” 
2CH.35.22	Nevertheless Josiah would not turn away from him, but disguised himself in order to fight with him. He did not listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, but joined battle in the plain of Megiddo. 
2CH.35.23	And the archers shot King Josiah; and the king said to his servants, “Take me away, for I am badly wounded.” 
2CH.35.24	So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried him in his second chariot and brought him to Jerusalem. And he died, and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. 
2CH.35.25	Jeremiah also uttered a lament for Josiah; and all the singing men and singing women have spoken of Josiah in their laments to this day. They made these an ordinance in Israel; behold, they are written in the Laments. 
2CH.35.26	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds according to what is written in the law of the 
2CH.35.27	and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
2CH.36.2	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. 
2CH.36.3	Then the king of Egypt deposed him in Jerusalem and laid upon the land a tribute of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold. 
2CH.36.4	And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim; but Neco took Jehoahaz his brother and carried him to Egypt.
2CH.36.6	Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters to take him to Babylon. 
2CH.36.7	Nebuchadnezzar also carried part of the vessels of the house of the 
2CH.36.8	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and the abominations which he did, and what was found against him, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah; and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
2CH.36.10	In the spring of the year King Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon, with the precious vessels of the house of the 
2CH.36.12	He did what was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.36.13	He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God; he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to the 
2CH.36.14	All the leading priests and the people likewise were exceedingly unfaithful, following all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted the house of the 
2CH.36.15	The 
2CH.36.16	but they kept mocking the messengers of God, despising his words, and scoffing at his prophets, till the wrath of the 
2CH.36.17	Therefore he brought up against them the king of the Chaldeans, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or virgin, old man or aged; he gave them all into his hand. 
2CH.36.18	And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the 
2CH.36.19	And they burned the house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burned all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all its precious vessels. 
2CH.36.20	He took into exile in Babylon those who had escaped from the sword, and they became servants to him and to his sons until the establishment of the kingdom of Persia, 
2CH.36.21	to fulfil the word of the 
2CH.36.23	“Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, ‘The 
EZR.1.2	“Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: The 
EZR.1.3	Whoever is among you of all his people, may his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and rebuild the house of the 
EZR.1.4	and let each survivor, in whatever place he sojourns, be assisted by the men of his place with silver and gold, with goods and with beasts, besides freewill offerings for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.”
EZR.1.5	Then rose up the heads of the fathers' houses of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and the Levites, every one whose spirit God had stirred to go up to rebuild the house of the 
EZR.1.6	and all who were about them aided them with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, with beasts, and with costly wares, besides all that was freely offered. 
EZR.1.7	Cyrus the king also brought out the vessels of the house of the 
EZR.1.8	Cyrus king of Persia brought these out in charge of Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Shesh-bazzar the prince of Judah. 
EZR.1.9	And this was the number of them: a thousand

EZR.2.56	the sons of Jaalah, the sons of Darkon, the sons of Giddel, 
EZR.2.57	the sons of Shephatiah, the sons of Hattil, the sons of Pochereth-hazzebaim, and the sons of Ami.
EZR.2.58	All the temple servants
EZR.2.59	The following were those who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer, though they could not prove their fathers' houses or their descent, whether they belonged to Israel: 
EZR.2.60	the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, and the sons of Nekoda, six hundred and fifty-two. 
EZR.2.61	Also, of the sons of the priests: the sons of Habaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, and the sons of Barzillai (who had taken a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called by their name). 
EZR.2.62	These sought their registration among those enrolled in the genealogies, but they were not found there, and so they were excluded from the priesthood as unclean; 
EZR.2.63	the governor told them that they were not to partake of the most holy food, until there should be a priest to consult Urim and Thummim.
EZR.2.64	The whole assembly together was forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty, 
EZR.2.65	besides their menservants and maidservants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven; and they had two hundred male and female singers. 
EZR.2.66	Their horses were seven hundred and thirty-six, their mules were two hundred and forty-five, 
EZR.2.67	their camels were four hundred and thirty-five, and their asses were six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
EZR.2.68	Some of the heads of families, when they came to the house of the 
EZR.2.69	according to their ability they gave to the treasury of the work sixty-one thousand darics of gold, five thousand minas of silver, and one hundred priests' garments.
EZR.2.70	The priests, the Levites, and some of the people lived in Jerusalem and its vicinity;
EZR.3.1	When the seventh month came, and the sons of Israel were in the towns, the people gathered as one man to Jerusalem. 
EZR.3.2	Then arose Jeshua the son of Jozadak, with his fellow priests, and Zerubbabel the son of She-alti-el with his kinsmen, and they built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings upon it, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God. 
EZR.3.3	They set the altar in its place, for fear was upon them because of the peoples of the lands, and they offered burnt offerings upon it to the 
EZR.3.4	And they kept the feast of booths, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the ordinance, as each day required, 
EZR.3.5	and after that the continual burnt offerings, the offerings at the new moon and at all the appointed feasts of the 
EZR.3.6	From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the 
EZR.3.7	So they gave money to the masons and the carpenters, and food, drink, and oil to the Sidonians and the Tyrians to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea, to Joppa, according to the grant which they had from Cyrus king of Persia.
EZR.3.8	Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of She-alti-el and Jeshua the son of Jozadak made a beginning, together with the rest of their brethren, the priests and the Levites and all who had come to Jerusalem from the captivity. They appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work of the house of the 
EZR.3.9	And Jeshua with his sons and his kinsmen, and Kadmi-el and his sons, the sons of Judah, together took the oversight of the workmen in the house of God, along with the sons of Henadad and the Levites, their sons and kinsmen.
EZR.3.10	And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the 
EZR.3.11	and they sang responsively, praising and giving thanks to the 
EZR.3.11	“For he is good,
EZR.3.11	for his steadfast love endures for ever toward Israel.”
EZR.3.11	And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the 
EZR.3.12	But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers' houses, old men who had seen the first house, wept with a loud voice when they saw the foundation of this house being laid, though many shouted aloud for joy; 
EZR.3.13	so that the people could not distinguish the sound of the joyful shout from the sound of the people's weeping, for the people shouted with a great shout, and the sound was heard afar.
EZR.4.1	Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the returned exiles were building a temple to the 
EZR.4.2	they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of fathers' houses and said to them, “Let us build with you; for we worship your God as you do, and we have been sacrificing to him ever since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assyria who brought us here.” 
EZR.4.3	But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers' houses in Israel said to them, “You have nothing to do with us in building a house to our God; but we alone will build to the 
EZR.4.4	Then the people of the land discouraged the people of Judah, and made them afraid to build, 
EZR.4.5	and hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
EZR.4.6	And in the reign of Ahasu-erus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
EZR.4.7	And in the days of Ar-ta-xerxes, Bishlam and Mithredath and Tabeel and the rest of their associates wrote to Ar-ta-xerxes king of Persia; the letter was written in Aramaic and translated.
EZR.4.8	Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Ar-ta-xerxes the king as follows— 
EZR.4.9	then wrote Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates, the judges, the governors, the officials, the Persians, the men of Erech, the Babylonians, the men of Susa, that is, the Elamites, 
EZR.4.10	and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar deported and settled in the cities of Samaria and in the rest of the province Beyond the River, and now 
EZR.4.11	this is a copy of the letter that they sent—“To Ar-ta-xerxes the king: Your servants, the men of the province Beyond the River, send greeting. And now 
EZR.4.12	be it known to the king that the Jews who came up from you to us have gone to Jerusalem. They are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city; they are finishing the walls and repairing the foundations. 
EZR.4.13	Now be it known to the king that, if this city is rebuilt and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and the royal revenue will be impaired. 
EZR.4.14	Now because we eat the salt of the palace and it is not fitting for us to witness the king's dishonor, therefore we send and inform the king, 
EZR.4.15	in order that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers. You will find in the book of the records and learn that this city is a rebellious city, hurtful to kings and provinces, and that sedition was stirred up in it from of old. That was why this city was laid waste. 
EZR.4.16	We make known to the king that, if this city is rebuilt and its walls finished, you will then have no possession in the province Beyond the River.”
EZR.4.17	The king sent an answer: “To Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their associates who live in Samaria and in the rest of the province Beyond the River, greeting. And now 
EZR.4.18	the letter which you sent to us has been plainly read before me. 
EZR.4.19	And I made a decree, and search has been made, and it has been found that this city from of old has risen against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made in it. 
EZR.4.20	And mighty kings have been over Jerusalem, who ruled over the whole province Beyond the River, to whom tribute, custom, and toll were paid. 
EZR.4.21	Therefore make a decree that these men be made to cease, and that this city be not rebuilt, until a decree is made by me. 
EZR.4.22	And take care not to be slack in this matter; why should damage grow to the hurt of the king?”
EZR.4.23	Then, when the copy of King Ar-ta-xerxes' letter was read before Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their associates, they went in haste to the Jews at Jerusalem and by force and power made them cease. 
EZR.4.24	Then the work on the house of God which is in Jerusalem stopped; and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
EZR.5.2	Then Zerubbabel the son of She-alti-el and Jeshua the son of Jozadak arose and began to rebuild the house of God which is in Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping them.
EZR.5.3	At the same time Tattenai the governor of the province Beyond the River and Shethar-bozenai and their associates came to them and spoke to them thus, “Who gave you a decree to build this house and to finish this structure?” 
EZR.5.4	They
EZR.5.5	But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them till a report should reach Darius and then answer be returned by letter concerning it.
EZR.5.6	The copy of the letter which Tattenai the governor of the province Beyond the River and Shethar-bozenai and his associates the governors who were in the province Beyond the River sent to Darius the king; 
EZR.5.7	they sent him a report, in which was written as follows: “To Darius the king, all peace. 
EZR.5.8	Be it known to the king that we went to the province of Judah, to the house of the great God. It is being built with huge stones, and timber is laid in the walls; this work goes on diligently and prospers in their hands. 
EZR.5.9	Then we asked those elders and spoke to them thus, ‘Who gave you a decree to build this house and to finish this structure?’ 
EZR.5.10	We also asked them their names, for your information, that we might write down the names of the men at their head. 
EZR.5.11	And this was their reply to us: ‘We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the house that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished. 
EZR.5.12	But because our fathers had angered the God of heaven, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house and carried away the people to Babylonia. 
EZR.5.13	 However in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree that this house of God should be rebuilt. 
EZR.5.14	And the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought into the temple of Babylon, these Cyrus the king took out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one whose name was Shesh-bazzar, whom he had made governor; 
EZR.5.15	and he said to him, “Take these vessels, go and put them in the temple which is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its site.” 
EZR.5.16	Then this Shesh-bazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God which is in Jerusalem; and from that time until now it has been in building, and it is not yet finished.’ 
EZR.5.17	Therefore, if it seem good to the king, let search be made in the royal archives there in Babylon, to see whether a decree was issued by Cyrus the king for the rebuilding of this house of God in Jerusalem. And let the king send us his pleasure in this matter.”
EZR.6.1	Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in Babylonia, in the house of the archives where the documents were stored. 
EZR.6.2	And in Ecbatana, the capital which is in the province of Media, a scroll was found on which this was written: “A record. 
EZR.6.3	 In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king issued a decree: Concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, let the house be rebuilt, the place where sacrifices are offered and burnt offerings are brought; its height shall be sixty cubits and its breadth sixty cubits, 
EZR.6.4	with three courses of great stones and one course of timber; let the cost be paid from the royal treasury. 
EZR.6.5	And also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that is in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be restored and brought back to the temple which is in Jerusalem, each to its place; you shall put them in the house of God.”
EZR.6.6	“Now therefore, Tattenai, governor of the province Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your associates the governors who are in the province Beyond the River, keep away; 
EZR.6.7	let the work on this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews rebuild this house of God on its site. 
EZR.6.8	Moreover I make a decree regarding what you shall do for these elders of the Jews for the rebuilding of this house of God; the cost is to be paid to these men in full and without delay from the royal revenue, the tribute of the province from Beyond the River. 
EZR.6.9	And whatever is needed—young bulls, rams, or sheep for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, or oil, as the priests at Jerusalem require—let that be given to them day by day without fail, 
EZR.6.10	that they may offer pleasing sacrifices to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king and his sons. 
EZR.6.11	Also I make a decree that if any one alters this edict, a beam shall be pulled out of his house, and he shall be impaled upon it, and his house shall be made a dunghill. 
EZR.6.12	May the God who has caused his name to dwell there overthrow any king or people that shall put forth a hand to alter this, or to destroy this house of God which is in Jerusalem. I Darius make a decree; let it be done with all diligence.”
EZR.6.13	Then, according to the word sent by Darius the king, Tattenai, the governor of the province Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates did with all diligence what Darius the king had ordered. 
EZR.6.14	And the elders of the Jews built and prospered, through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. They finished their building by command of the God of Israel and by decree of Cyrus and Darius and Ar-ta-xerxes king of Persia; 
EZR.6.15	and this house was finished on the third day of the month of Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.
EZR.6.16	And the people of Israel, the priests and the Levites, and the rest of the returned exiles, celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy. 
EZR.6.17	They offered at the dedication of this house of God one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and as a sin offering for all Israel twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel. 
EZR.6.18	And they set the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God at Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses.
EZR.6.19	On the fourteenth day of the first month the returned exiles kept the passover. 
EZR.6.20	For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were clean. So they killed the passover lamb for all the returned exiles, for their fellow priests, and for themselves; 
EZR.6.21	it was eaten by the people of Israel who had returned from exile, and also by every one who had joined them and separated himself from the pollutions of the peoples of the land to worship the 
EZR.6.22	And they kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy; for the 
EZR.7.1	Now after this, in the reign of Ar-ta-xerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah, 
EZR.7.2	son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub, 
EZR.7.3	son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth, 
EZR.7.4	son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki, 
EZR.7.5	son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the chief priest— 
EZR.7.6	this Ezra went up from Babylonia. He was a scribe skilled in the law of Moses which the 
EZR.7.7	And there went up also to Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Ar-ta-xerxes the king, some of the people of Israel, and some of the priests and Levites, the singers and gatekeepers, and the temple servants. 
EZR.7.8	And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king; 
EZR.7.9	for on the first day of the first month he began
EZR.7.10	For Ezra had set his heart to study the law of the 
EZR.7.11	This is a copy of the letter which King Ar-ta-xerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, learned in matters of the commandments of the 
EZR.7.12	“Ar-ta-xerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven.
EZR.7.13	I make a decree that any one of the people of Israel or their priests or Levites in my kingdom, who freely offers to go to Jerusalem, may go with you. 
EZR.7.14	For you are sent by the king and his seven counselors to make inquiries about Judah and Jerusalem according to the law of your God, which is in your hand, 
EZR.7.15	and also to convey the silver and gold which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem, 
EZR.7.16	with all the silver and gold which you shall find in the whole province of Babylonia, and with the freewill offerings of the people and the priests, vowed willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.17	With this money, then, you shall with all diligence buy bulls, rams, and lambs, with their cereal offerings and their drink offerings, and you shall offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.18	Whatever seems good to you and your brethren to do with the rest of the silver and gold, you may do, according to the will of your God. 
EZR.7.19	The vessels that have been given you for the service of the house of your God, you shall deliver before the God of Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.20	And whatever else is required for the house of your God, which you have occasion to provide, you may provide it out of the king's treasury.
EZR.7.21	“And I, Ar-ta-xerxes the king, make a decree to all the treasurers in the province Beyond the River: Whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, requires of you, be it done with all diligence, 
EZR.7.22	up to a hundred talents of silver, a hundred cors of wheat, a hundred baths of wine, a hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much. 
EZR.7.23	Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done in full for the house of the God of heaven, lest his wrath be against the realm of the king and his sons. 
EZR.7.24	We also notify you that it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, custom, or toll upon any one of the priests, the Levites, the singers, the doorkeepers, the temple servants, or other servants of this house of God.
EZR.7.25	“And you, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God which is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges who may judge all the people in the province Beyond the River, all such as know the laws of your God; and those who do not know them, you shall teach. 
EZR.7.26	Whoever will not obey the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be strictly executed upon him, whether for death or for banishment or for confiscation of his goods or for imprisonment.”
EZR.7.27	Blessed be the 
EZR.7.28	and who extended to me his steadfast love before the king and his counselors, and before all the king's mighty officers. I took courage, for the hand of the 
EZR.8.1	These are the heads of their fathers' houses, and this is the genealogy of those who went up with me from Babylonia, in the reign of Ar-ta-xerxes the king: 
EZR.8.2	Of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom. Of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel. Of the sons of David, Hattush, 
EZR.8.3	of the sons of Shecaniah. Of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah, with whom were registered one hundred and fifty men. 
EZR.8.4	Of the sons of Pahath-moab, Eli-e-ho-enai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred men. 
EZR.8.5	Of the sons of Zattu,
EZR.8.6	Of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty men. 
EZR.8.7	Of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy men. 
EZR.8.8	Of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him eighty men. 
EZR.8.9	Of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen men. 
EZR.8.10	Of the sons of Bani,
EZR.8.11	Of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah, the son of Bebai, and with him twenty-eight men. 
EZR.8.12	Of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him a hundred and ten men. 
EZR.8.13	Of the sons of Adonikam, those who came later, their names being Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah, and with them sixty men. 
EZR.8.14	Of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zaccur, and with them seventy men.
EZR.8.15	I gathered them to the river that runs to Ahava, and there we encamped three days. As I reviewed the people and the priests, I found there none of the sons of Levi. 
EZR.8.16	Then I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, leading men, and for Joiarib and Elnathan, who were men of insight, 
EZR.8.17	and sent them to Iddo, the leading man at the place Casiphia, telling them what to say to Iddo and his brethren the temple servants
EZR.8.18	And by the good hand of our God upon us, they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli the son of Levi, son of Israel, namely Sherebiah with his sons and kinsmen, eighteen; 
EZR.8.19	also Hashabiah and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, with his kinsmen and their sons, twenty; 
EZR.8.20	besides two hundred and twenty of the temple servants, whom David and his officials had set apart to attend the Levites. These were all mentioned by name.
EZR.8.21	Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek from him a straight way for ourselves, our children, and all our goods. 
EZR.8.22	For I was ashamed to ask the king for a band of soldiers and horsemen to protect us against the enemy on our way; since we had told the king, “The hand of our God is for good upon all that seek him, and the power of his wrath is against all that forsake him.” 
EZR.8.23	So we fasted and besought our God for this, and he listened to our entreaty.
EZR.8.24	Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests: Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their kinsmen with them. 
EZR.8.25	And I weighed out to them the silver and the gold and the vessels, the offering for the house of our God which the king and his counselors and his lords and all Israel there present had offered; 
EZR.8.26	I weighed out into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels worth a hundred talents, and a hundred talents of gold, 
EZR.8.27	twenty bowls of gold worth a thousand darics, and two vessels of fine bright bronze as precious as gold. 
EZR.8.28	And I said to them, “You are holy to the 
EZR.8.29	Guard them and keep them until you weigh them before the chief priests and the Levites and the heads of fathers' houses in Israel at Jerusalem, within the chambers of the house of the 
EZR.8.30	So the priests and the Levites took over the weight of the silver and the gold and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem, to the house of our God.
EZR.8.31	Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem; the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from ambushes by the way. 
EZR.8.32	We came to Jerusalem, and there we remained three days. 
EZR.8.33	On the fourth day, within the house of our God, the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed into the hands of Meremoth the priest, son of Uriah, and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas, and with them were the Levites, Jozabad the son of Jeshua and No-adiah the son of Binnui. 
EZR.8.34	The whole was counted and weighed, and the weight of everything was recorded.
EZR.8.35	At that time those who had come from captivity, the returned exiles, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and as a sin offering twelve he-goats; all this was a burnt offering to the 
EZR.8.36	They also delivered the king's commissions to the king's satraps and to the governors of the province Beyond the River; and they aided the people and the house of God.
EZR.9.1	After these things had been done, the officials approached me and said, “The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands with their abominations, from the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites. 
EZR.9.2	For they have taken some of their daughters to be wives for themselves and for their sons; so that the holy race has mixed itself with the peoples of the lands. And in this faithlessness the hand of the officials and chief men has been foremost.” 
EZR.9.3	When I heard this, I rent my garments and my mantle, and pulled hair from my head and beard, and sat appalled. 
EZR.9.4	Then all who trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the faithlessness of the returned exiles, gathered round me while I sat appalled until the evening sacrifice. 
EZR.9.5	And at the evening sacrifice I rose from my fasting, with my garments and my mantle rent, and fell upon my knees and spread out my hands to the 
EZR.9.6	saying:
EZR.9.6	“O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift my face to thee, my God, for our iniquities have risen higher than our heads, and our guilt has mounted up to the heavens. 
EZR.9.7	From the days of our fathers to this day we have been in great guilt; and for our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plundering, and to utter shame, as at this day. 
EZR.9.8	But now for a brief moment favor has been shown by the 
EZR.9.9	For we are bondmen; yet our God has not forsaken us in our bondage, but has extended to us his steadfast love before the kings of Persia, to grant us some reviving to set up the house of our God, to repair its ruins, and to give us protection
EZR.9.10	“And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken thy commandments, 
EZR.9.11	which thou didst command by thy servants the prophets, saying, ‘The land which you are entering, to take possession of it, is a land unclean with the pollutions of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations which have filled it from end to end with their uncleanness. 
EZR.9.12	Therefore give not your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters for your sons, and never seek their peace or prosperity, that you may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.’ 
EZR.9.13	And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt, seeing that thou, our God, hast punished us less than our iniquities deserved and hast given us such a remnant as this, 
EZR.9.14	shall we break thy commandments again and intermarry with the peoples who practice these abominations? Wouldst thou not be angry with us till thou wouldst consume us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape? 
EZR.9.15	O 
EZR.10.1	While Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, a very great assembly of men, women, and children, gathered to him out of Israel; for the people wept bitterly. 
EZR.10.2	And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, of the sons of Elam, addressed Ezra: “We have broken faith with our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land, but even now there is hope for Israel in spite of this. 
EZR.10.3	Therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all these wives and their children, according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law. 
EZR.10.4	Arise, for it is your task, and we are with you; be strong and do it.” 
EZR.10.5	Then Ezra arose and made the leading priests and Levites and all Israel take oath that they would do as had been said. So they took the oath.
EZR.10.6	Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God, and went to the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib, where he spent the night,
EZR.10.7	And a proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the returned exiles that they should assemble at Jerusalem, 
EZR.10.8	and that if any one did not come within three days, by order of the officials and the elders all his property should be forfeited, and he himself banned from the congregation of the exiles.
EZR.10.9	Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within the three days; it was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month. And all the people sat in the open square before the house of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the heavy rain. 
EZR.10.10	And Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have trespassed and married foreign women, and so increased the guilt of Israel. 
EZR.10.11	Now then make confession to the 
EZR.10.12	Then all the assembly answered with a loud voice, “It is so; we must do as you have said. 
EZR.10.13	But the people are many, and it is a time of heavy rain; we cannot stand in the open. Nor is this a work for one day or for two; for we have greatly transgressed in this matter. 
EZR.10.14	Let our officials stand for the whole assembly; let all in our cities who have taken foreign wives come at appointed times, and with them the elders and judges of every city, till the fierce wrath of our God over this matter be averted from us.” 
EZR.10.15	Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah opposed this, and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supported them.
EZR.10.16	Then the returned exiles did so. Ezra the priest selected men,
EZR.10.17	and by the first day of the first month they had come to the end of all the men who had married foreign women.
EZR.10.18	Of the sons of the priests who had married foreign women were found Ma-aseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brethren. 
EZR.10.19	They pledged themselves to put away their wives, and their guilt offering was a ram of the flock for their guilt. 
EZR.10.20	Of the sons of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah. 
EZR.10.21	Of the sons of Harim: Ma-aseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah.

EZR.10.30	Of the sons of Pahath-moab: Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Ma-aseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui, and Manasseh. 
EZR.10.31	Of the sons of Harim: Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shime-on, 
EZR.10.32	Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah. 
EZR.10.33	Of the sons of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shime-i.

EZR.10.42	Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph. 
EZR.10.43	Of the sons of Nebo: Je-iel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel, and Benaiah. 
EZR.10.44	All these had married foreign women, and they put them away with their children.
NEH.1.1	The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah.
NEH.1.1	Now it happened in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Susa the capital, 
NEH.1.2	that Hanani, one of my brethren, came with certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that survived, who had escaped exile, and concerning Jerusalem. 
NEH.1.3	And they said to me, “The survivors there in the province who escaped exile are in great trouble and shame; the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates are destroyed by fire.”
NEH.1.4	When I heard these words I sat down and wept, and mourned for days; and I continued fasting and praying before the God of heaven. 
NEH.1.5	And I said, “O 
NEH.1.6	let thy ear be attentive, and thy eyes open, to hear the prayer of thy servant which I now pray before thee day and night for the people of Israel thy servants, confessing the sins of the people of Israel, which we have sinned against thee. Yea, I and my father's house have sinned. 
NEH.1.7	We have acted very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances which thou didst command thy servant Moses. 
NEH.1.8	Remember the word which thou didst command thy servant Moses, saying, ‘If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the peoples; 
NEH.1.9	but if you return to me and keep my commandments and do them, though your dispersed be under the farthest skies, I will gather them thence and bring them to the place which I have chosen, to make my name dwell there.’ 
NEH.1.10	They are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power and by thy strong hand. 
NEH.1.11	O Lord, let thy ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants who delight to fear thy name; and give success to thy servant today, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.”
NEH.1.11	Now I was cupbearer to the king.
NEH.2.1	In the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Ar-ta-xerxes, when wine was before him, I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad in his presence. 
NEH.2.2	And the king said to me, “Why is your face sad, seeing you are not sick? This is nothing else but sadness of the heart.” Then I was very much afraid. 
NEH.2.3	I said to the king, “Let the king live for ever! Why should not my face be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lies waste, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?” 
NEH.2.4	Then the king said to me, “For what do you make request?” So I prayed to the God of heaven. 
NEH.2.5	And I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, that you send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may rebuild it.” 
NEH.2.6	And the king said to me (the queen sitting beside him), “How long will you be gone, and when will you return?” So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time. 
NEH.2.7	And I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the governors of the province Beyond the River, that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah; 
NEH.2.8	and a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress of the temple, and for the wall of the city, and for the house which I shall occupy.” And the king granted me what I asked, for the good hand of my God was upon me.
NEH.2.9	Then I came to the governors of the province Beyond the River, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen. 
NEH.2.10	But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard this, it displeased them greatly that some one had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.
NEH.2.11	So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days. 
NEH.2.12	Then I arose in the night, I and a few men with me; and I told no one what my God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. There was no beast with me but the beast on which I rode. 
NEH.2.13	I went out by night by the Valley Gate to the Jackal's Well and to the Dung Gate, and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and its gates which had been destroyed by fire. 
NEH.2.14	Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the King's Pool; but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass. 
NEH.2.15	Then I went up in the night by the valley and inspected the wall; and I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned. 
NEH.2.16	And the officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing; and I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, and the rest that were to do the work.
NEH.2.17	Then I said to them, “You see the trouble we are in, how Jerusalem lies in ruins with its gates burned. Come, let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no longer suffer disgrace.” 
NEH.2.18	And I told them of the hand of my God which had been upon me for good, and also of the words which the king had spoken to me. And they said, “Let us rise up and build.” So they strengthened their hands for the good work. 
NEH.2.19	But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arab heard of it, they derided us and despised us and said, “What is this thing that you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?” 
NEH.2.20	Then I replied to them, “The God of heaven will make us prosper, and we his servants will arise and build; but you have no portion or right or memorial in Jerusalem.”
NEH.3.1	Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests and they built the Sheep Gate. They consecrated it and set its doors; they consecrated it as far as the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Tower of Hananel. 
NEH.3.2	And next to him the men of Jericho built. And next to them
NEH.3.3	And the sons of Hassenaah built the Fish Gate; they laid its beams and set its doors, its bolts, and its bars. 
NEH.3.4	And next to them Meremoth the son of Uriah, son of Hakkoz repaired. And next to them Meshullam the son of Berechiah, son of Meshezabel repaired. And next to them Zadok the son of Baana repaired. 
NEH.3.5	And next to them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles did not put their necks to the work of their 
NEH.3.6	And Joiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah repaired the Old Gate; they laid its beams and set its doors, its bolts, and its bars. 
NEH.3.7	And next to them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon and of Mizpah, who were under the jurisdiction of the governor of the province Beyond the River. 
NEH.3.8	Next to them Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, goldsmiths, repaired. Next to him Hananiah, one of the perfumers, repaired; and they restored
NEH.3.9	Next to them Rephaiah the son of Hur, ruler of half the district of
NEH.3.10	Next to them Jedaiah the son of Harumaph repaired opposite his house; and next to him Hattush the son of Hashabneiah repaired. 
NEH.3.11	Malchijah the son of Harim and Hasshub the son of Pahath-moab repaired another section and the Tower of the Ovens. 
NEH.3.12	Next to him Shallum the son of Hallohesh, ruler of half the district of
NEH.3.13	Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate; they rebuilt it and set its doors, its bolts, and its bars, and repaired a thousand cubits of the wall, as far as the Dung Gate.
NEH.3.14	Malchijah the son of Rechab, ruler of the district of
NEH.3.15	And Shallum the son of Colhozeh, ruler of the district of
NEH.3.16	After him Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, ruler of half the district of
NEH.3.17	After him the Levites repaired: Rehum the son of Bani; next to him Hashabiah, ruler of half the district of
NEH.3.18	After him their brethren repaired: Bavvai the son of Henadad, ruler of half the district of
NEH.3.19	next to him Ezer the son of Jeshua, ruler of Mizpah, repaired another section opposite the ascent to the armory at the Angle. 
NEH.3.20	After him Baruch the son of Zabbai repaired another section from the Angle to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest. 
NEH.3.21	After him Meremoth the son of Uriah, son of Hakkoz repaired another section from the door of the house of Eliashib to the end of the house of Eliashib. 
NEH.3.22	After him the priests, the men of the Plain, repaired. 
NEH.3.23	After them Benjamin and Hasshub repaired opposite their house. After them Azariah the son of Ma-aseiah, son of Ananiah repaired beside his own house. 
NEH.3.24	After him Binnui the son of Henadad repaired another section, from the house of Azariah to the Angle 
NEH.3.25	and to the corner. Palal the son of Uzai repaired opposite the Angle and the tower projecting from the upper house of the king at the court of the guard. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh 
NEH.3.26	and the temple servants living
NEH.3.27	After him the Tekoites repaired another section opposite the great projecting tower as far as the wall of Ophel.
NEH.3.28	Above the Horse Gate the priests repaired, each one opposite his own house. 
NEH.3.29	After them Zadok the son of Immer repaired opposite his own house. After him Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the East Gate, repaired. 
NEH.3.30	After him Hananiah the son of Shelemiah and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph repaired another section. After him Meshullam the son of Berechiah repaired opposite his chamber. 
NEH.3.31	After him Malchijah, one of the goldsmiths, repaired as far as the house of the temple servants and of the merchants, opposite the Muster Gate,
NEH.3.32	And between the upper chamber of the corner and the Sheep Gate the goldsmiths and the merchants repaired.
NEH.4.2	And he said in the presence of his brethren and of the army of Samaria, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they restore things? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish up in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, and burned ones at that?” 
NEH.4.3	Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, “Yes, what they are building—if a fox goes up on it he will break down their stone wall!” 
NEH.4.4	Hear, O our God, for we are despised; turn back their taunt upon their own heads, and give them up to be plundered in a land where they are captives. 
NEH.4.5	Do not cover their guilt, and let not their sin be blotted out from thy sight; for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders.
NEH.4.6	So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to half its height. For the people had a mind to work.
NEH.4.8	and they all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to cause confusion in it. 
NEH.4.9	And we prayed to our God, and set a guard as a protection against them day and night.
NEH.4.10	But Judah said, “The strength of the burden-bearers is failing, and there is much rubbish; we are not able to work on the wall.” 
NEH.4.11	And our enemies said, “They will not know or see till we come into the midst of them and kill them and stop the work.” 
NEH.4.12	When the Jews who lived by them came they said to us ten times, “From all the places where they live
NEH.4.13	So in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in open places, I stationed the people according to their families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows. 
NEH.4.14	And I looked, and arose, and said to the nobles and to the officials and to the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your homes.”
NEH.4.15	When our enemies heard that it was known to us and that God had frustrated their plan, we all returned to the wall, each to his work. 
NEH.4.16	From that day on, half of my servants worked on construction, and half held the spears, shields, bows, and coats of mail; and the leaders stood behind all the house of Judah, 
NEH.4.17	who were building on the wall. Those who carried burdens were laden in such a way that each with one hand labored on the work and with the other held his weapon. 
NEH.4.18	And each of the builders had his sword girded at his side while he built. The man who sounded the trumpet was beside me. 
NEH.4.19	And I said to the nobles and to the officials and to the rest of the people, “The work is great and widely spread, and we are separated on the wall, far from one another. 
NEH.4.20	In the place where you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us.”
NEH.4.21	So we labored at the work, and half of them held the spears from the break of dawn till the stars came out. 
NEH.4.22	I also said to the people at that time, “Let every man and his servant pass the night within Jerusalem, that they may be a guard for us by night and may labor by day.” 
NEH.4.23	So neither I nor my brethren nor my servants nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us took off our clothes; each kept his weapon in his hand.
NEH.5.1	Now there arose a great outcry of the people and of their wives against their Jewish brethren. 
NEH.5.2	For there were those who said, “With our sons and our daughters, we are many; let us get grain, that we may eat and keep alive.” 
NEH.5.3	There were also those who said, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards, and our houses to get grain because of the famine.” 
NEH.5.4	And there were those who said, “We have borrowed money for the king's tax upon our fields and our vineyards. 
NEH.5.5	Now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children are as their children; yet we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and some of our daughters have already been enslaved; but it is not in our power to help it, for other men have our fields and our vineyards.”
NEH.5.6	I was very angry when I heard their outcry and these words. 
NEH.5.7	I took counsel with myself, and I brought charges against the nobles and the officials. I said to them, “You are exacting interest, each from his brother.” And I held a great assembly against them, 
NEH.5.8	and said to them, “We, as far as we are able, have bought back our Jewish brethren who have been sold to the nations; but you even sell your brethren that they may be sold to us!” They were silent, and could not find a word to say. 
NEH.5.9	So I said, “The thing that you are doing is not good. Ought you not to walk in the fear of our God to prevent the taunts of the nations our enemies? 
NEH.5.10	Moreover I and my brethren and my servants are lending them money and grain. Let us leave off this interest. 
NEH.5.11	Return to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive orchards, and their houses, and the hundredth of money, grain, wine, and oil which you have been exacting of them.” 
NEH.5.12	Then they said, “We will restore these and require nothing from them. We will do as you say.” And I called the priests, and took an oath of them to do as they had promised. 
NEH.5.13	I also shook out my lap and said, “So may God shake out every man from his house and from his labor who does not perform this promise. So may he be shaken out and emptied.” And all the assembly said “Amen” and praised the 
NEH.5.14	Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of Ar-ta-xerxes the king, twelve years, neither I nor my brethren ate the food allowance of the governor. 
NEH.5.15	The former governors who were before me laid heavy burdens upon the people, and took from them food and wine, besides forty shekels of silver. Even their servants lorded it over the people. But I did not do so, because of the fear of God. 
NEH.5.16	I also held to the work on this wall, and acquired no land; and all my servants were gathered there for the work. 
NEH.5.17	Moreover there were at my table a hundred and fifty men, Jews and officials, besides those who came to us from the nations which were about us. 
NEH.5.18	Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; fowls likewise were prepared for me, and every ten days skins of wine in abundance; yet with all this I did not demand the food allowance of the governor, because the servitude was heavy upon this people. 
NEH.5.19	Remember for my good, O my God, all that I have done for this people.
NEH.6.1	Now when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah and to Geshem the Arab and to the rest of our enemies that I had built the wall and that there was no breach left in it (although up to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates), 
NEH.6.2	Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, “Come and let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono.” But they intended to do me harm. 
NEH.6.3	And I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work and I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?” 
NEH.6.4	And they sent to me four times in this way and I answered them in the same manner. 
NEH.6.5	In the same way Sanballat for the fifth time sent his servant to me with an open letter in his hand. 
NEH.6.6	In it was written, “It is reported among the nations, and Geshem
NEH.6.7	And you have also set up prophets to proclaim concerning you in Jerusalem, ‘There is a king in Judah.’ And now it will be reported to the king according to these words. So now come, and let us take counsel together.” 
NEH.6.8	Then I sent to him, saying, “No such things as you say have been done, for you are inventing them out of your own mind.” 
NEH.6.9	For they all wanted to frighten us, thinking, “Their hands will drop from the work, and it will not be done.” But now, O God, strengthen thou my hands.
NEH.6.10	Now when I went into the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was shut up, he said, “Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple; for they are coming to kill you, at night they are coming to kill you.” 
NEH.6.11	But I said, “Should such a man as I flee? And what man such as I could go into the temple and live?
NEH.6.12	And I understood, and saw that God had not sent him, but he had pronounced the prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. 
NEH.6.13	For this purpose he was hired, that I should be afraid and act in this way and sin, and so they could give me an evil name, in order to taunt me. 
NEH.6.14	Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, O my God, according to these things that they did, and also the prophetess No-adiah and the rest of the prophets who wanted to make me afraid.
NEH.6.15	So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty-two days. 
NEH.6.16	And when all our enemies heard of it, all the nations round about us were afraid
NEH.6.17	Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah's letters came to them. 
NEH.6.18	For many in Judah were bound by oath to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah: and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah as his wife. 
NEH.6.19	Also they spoke of his good deeds in my presence, and reported my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to make me afraid.
NEH.7.1	Now when the wall had been built and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites had been appointed, 
NEH.7.2	I gave my brother Hanani and Hananiah the governor of the castle charge over Jerusalem, for he was a more faithful and God-fearing man than many. 
NEH.7.3	And I said to them, “Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while they are still standing guard
NEH.7.4	The city was wide and large, but the people within it were few and no houses had been built.
NEH.7.5	Then God put it into my mind to assemble the nobles and the officials and the people to be enrolled by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of those who came up at the first, and I found written in it:
NEH.7.7	They came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah.

NEH.7.48	the sons of Lebana, the sons of Hagaba, the sons of Shalmai, 
NEH.7.49	the sons of Hanan, the sons of Giddel, the sons of Gahar, 
NEH.7.50	the sons of Re-aiah, the sons of Rezin, the sons of Nekoda, 
NEH.7.51	the sons of Gazzam, the sons of Uzza, the sons of Paseah, 
NEH.7.52	the sons of Besai, the sons of Me-unim, the sons of Nephushesim, 
NEH.7.53	the sons of Bakbuk, the sons of Hakupha, the sons of Harhur, 
NEH.7.54	the sons of Bazlith, the sons of Mehida, the sons of Harsha, 
NEH.7.55	the sons of Barkos, the sons of Sisera, the sons of Temah, 
NEH.7.56	the sons of Neziah, the sons of Hatipha.
NEH.7.57	The sons of Solomon's servants: the sons of Sotai, the sons of Sophereth, the sons of Perida, 
NEH.7.58	the sons of Jaala, the sons of Darkon, the sons of Giddel, 
NEH.7.59	the sons of Shephatiah, the sons of Hattil, the sons of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the sons of Amon.
NEH.7.60	All the temple servants and the sons of Solomon's servants were three hundred and ninety-two.
NEH.7.61	The following were those who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer, but they could not prove their fathers' houses nor their descent, whether they belonged to Israel: 
NEH.7.62	the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, six hundred and forty-two. 
NEH.7.63	Also, of the priests: the sons of Hobaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai (who had taken a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by their name). 
NEH.7.64	These sought their registration among those enrolled in the genealogies, but it was not found there, so they were excluded from the priesthood as unclean; 
NEH.7.65	the governor told them that they were not to partake of the most holy food, until a priest with Urim and Thummim should arise.
NEH.7.66	The whole assembly together was forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty, 
NEH.7.67	besides their menservants and maidservants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven; and they had two hundred and forty-five singers, male and female. 
NEH.7.68	Their horses were seven hundred and thirty-six, their mules two hundred and forty-five,
NEH.7.69	their camels four hundred and thirty-five, and their asses six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
NEH.7.70	Now some of the heads of fathers' houses gave to the work. The governor gave to the treasury a thousand darics of gold, fifty basins, five hundred and thirty priests' garments. 
NEH.7.71	And some of the heads of fathers' houses gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold and two thousand two hundred minas of silver. 
NEH.7.72	And what the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold, two thousand minas of silver, and sixty-seven priests' garments.
NEH.7.73	So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple servants, and all Israel, lived in their towns.
NEH.7.73	And when the seventh month had come, the children of Israel were in their towns.
NEH.8.1	And all the people gathered as one man into the square before the Water Gate; and they told Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses which the 
NEH.8.2	And Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly, both men and women and all who could hear with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month. 
NEH.8.3	And he read from it facing the square before the Water Gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women and those who could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law. 
NEH.8.4	And Ezra the scribe stood on a wooden pulpit which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Ma-aseiah on his right hand; and Pedaiah, Misha-el, Malchijah, Hashum, Hash-baddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam on his left hand. 
NEH.8.5	And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was above all the people; and when he opened it all the people stood. 
NEH.8.6	And Ezra blessed the 
NEH.8.7	Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Ma-aseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, the Levites,
NEH.8.8	And they read from the book, from the law of God, clearly;
NEH.8.9	And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, “This day is holy to the 
NEH.8.10	Then he said to them, “Go your way, eat the fat and drink sweet wine and send portions to him for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord; and do not be grieved, for the joy of the 
NEH.8.11	So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, “Be quiet, for this day is holy; do not be grieved.” 
NEH.8.12	And all the people went their way to eat and drink and to send portions and to make great rejoicing, because they had understood the words that were declared to them.
NEH.8.13	On the second day the heads of fathers' houses of all the people, with the priests and the Levites, came together to Ezra the scribe in order to study the words of the law. 
NEH.8.14	And they found it written in the law that the 
NEH.8.15	and that they should publish and proclaim in all their towns and in Jerusalem, “Go out to the hills and bring branches of olive, wild olive, myrtle, palm, and other leafy trees to make booths, as it is written.” 
NEH.8.16	So the people went out and brought them and made booths for themselves, each on his roof, and in their courts and in the courts of the house of God, and in the square at the Water Gate and in the square at the Gate of Ephraim. 
NEH.8.17	And all the assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made booths and dwelt in the booths; for from the days of Jeshua the son of Nun to that day the people of Israel had not done so. And there was very great rejoicing. 
NEH.8.18	And day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read from the book of the law of God. They kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day there was a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance.
NEH.9.1	Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the people of Israel were assembled with fasting and in sackcloth, and with earth upon their heads. 
NEH.9.2	And the Israelites separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers. 
NEH.9.3	And they stood up in their place and read from the book of the law of the 
NEH.9.4	Upon the stairs of the Levites stood Jeshua, Bani, Kadmi-el, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani; and they cried with a loud voice to the 
NEH.9.5	Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, “Stand up and bless the 
NEH.9.6	And Ezra said:
NEH.9.7	Thou art the 
NEH.9.8	and thou didst find his heart faithful before thee, and didst make with him the covenant to give to his descendants the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, and the Girgashite; and thou hast fulfilled thy promise, for thou art righteous.
NEH.9.9	“And thou didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt and hear their cry at the Red Sea, 
NEH.9.10	and didst perform signs and wonders against Pharaoh and all his servants and all the people of his land, for thou knewest that they acted insolently against our fathers; and thou didst get thee a name, as it is to this day. 
NEH.9.11	And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on dry land; and thou didst cast their pursuers into the depths, as a stone into mighty waters. 
NEH.9.12	By a pillar of cloud thou didst lead them in the day, and by a pillar of fire in the night to light for them the way in which they should go. 
NEH.9.13	Thou didst come down upon Mount Sinai, and speak with them from heaven and give them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments, 
NEH.9.14	and thou didst make known to them thy holy sabbath and command them commandments and statutes and a law by Moses thy servant. 
NEH.9.15	Thou didst give them bread from heaven for their hunger and bring forth water for them from the rock for their thirst, and thou didst tell them to go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.
NEH.9.16	“But they and our fathers acted presumptuously and stiffened their neck and did not obey thy commandments; 
NEH.9.17	they refused to obey, and were not mindful of the wonders which thou didst perform among them; but they stiffened their neck and appointed a leader to return to their bondage in Egypt. But thou art a God ready to forgive, gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and didst not forsake them. 
NEH.9.18	Even when they had made for themselves a molten calf and said, ‘This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,’ and had committed great blasphemies, 
NEH.9.19	thou in thy great mercies didst not forsake them in the wilderness; the pillar of cloud which led them in the way did not depart from them by day, nor the pillar of fire by night which lighted for them the way by which they should go. 
NEH.9.20	Thou gavest thy good Spirit to instruct them, and didst not withhold thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst. 
NEH.9.21	Forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, and they lacked nothing; their clothes did not wear out and their feet did not swell. 
NEH.9.22	And thou didst give them kingdoms and peoples, and didst allot to them every corner; so they took possession of the land of Sihon king of Heshbon and the land of Og king of Bashan. 
NEH.9.23	Thou didst multiply their descendants as the stars of heaven, and thou didst bring them into the land which thou hadst told their fathers to enter and possess. 
NEH.9.24	So the descendants went in and possessed the land, and thou didst subdue before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and didst give them into their hands, with their kings and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would. 
NEH.9.25	And they captured fortified cities and a rich land, and took possession of houses full of all good things, cisterns hewn out, vineyards, olive orchards and fruit trees in abundance; so they ate, and were filled and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.
NEH.9.26	“Nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against thee and cast thy law behind their back and killed thy prophets, who had warned them in order to turn them back to thee, and they committed great blasphemies. 
NEH.9.27	Therefore thou didst give them into the hand of their enemies, who made them suffer; and in the time of their suffering they cried to thee and thou didst hear them from heaven; and according to thy great mercies thou didst give them saviors who saved them from the hand of their enemies. 
NEH.9.28	But after they had rest they did evil again before thee, and thou didst abandon them to the hand of their enemies, so that they had dominion over them; yet when they turned and cried to thee thou didst hear from heaven, and many times thou didst deliver them according to thy mercies. 
NEH.9.29	And thou didst warn them in order to turn them back to thy law. Yet they acted presumptuously and did not obey thy commandments, but sinned against thy ordinances, by the observance of which a man shall live, and turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck and would not obey. 
NEH.9.30	Many years thou didst bear with them, and didst warn them by thy Spirit through thy prophets; yet they would not give ear. Therefore thou didst give them into the hand of the peoples of the lands. 
NEH.9.31	Nevertheless in thy great mercies thou didst not make an end of them or forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God.
NEH.9.32	“Now therefore, our God, the great and mighty and terrible God, who keepest covenant and steadfast love, let not all the hardship seem little to thee that has come upon us, upon our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our fathers, and all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria until this day. 
NEH.9.33	Yet thou hast been just in all that has come upon us, for thou hast dealt faithfully and we have acted wickedly; 
NEH.9.34	our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept thy law or heeded thy commandments and thy warnings which thou didst give them. 
NEH.9.35	They did not serve thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness which thou gavest them, and in the large and rich land which thou didst set before them; and they did not turn from their wicked works. 
NEH.9.36	Behold, we are slaves this day; in the land that thou gavest to our fathers to enjoy its fruit and its good gifts, behold, we are slaves. 
NEH.9.37	And its rich yield goes to the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins; they have power also over our bodies and over our cattle at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.”

NEH.10.30	We will not give our daughters to the peoples of the land or take their daughters for our sons; 
NEH.10.31	and if the peoples of the land bring in wares or any grain on the sabbath day to sell, we will not buy from them on the sabbath or on a holy day; and we will forego the crops of the seventh year and the exaction of every debt.
NEH.10.32	We also lay upon ourselves the obligation to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God: 
NEH.10.33	for the showbread, the continual cereal offering, the continual burnt offering, the sabbaths, the new moons, the appointed feasts, the holy things, and the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God. 
NEH.10.34	We have likewise cast lots, the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our God, according to our fathers' houses, at times appointed, year by year, to burn upon the altar of the 
NEH.10.35	We obligate ourselves to bring the first fruits of our ground and the first fruits of all fruit of every tree, year by year, to the house of the

NEH.10.37	and to bring the first of our coarse meal, and our contributions, the fruit of every tree, the wine and the oil, to the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and to bring to the Levites the tithes from our ground, for it is the Levites who collect the tithes in all our rural towns. 
NEH.10.38	And the priest, the son of Aaron, shall be with the Levites when the Levites receive the tithes; and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes to the house of our God, to the chambers, to the storehouse. 
NEH.10.39	For the people of Israel and the sons of Levi shall bring the contribution of grain, wine, and oil to the chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister, and the gatekeepers and the singers. We will not neglect the house of our God.
NEH.11.1	Now the leaders of the people lived in Jerusalem; and the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of ten to live in Jerusalem the holy city, while nine tenths remained in the other towns. 
NEH.11.2	And the people blessed all the men who willingly offered to live in Jerusalem.
NEH.11.4	And in Jerusalem lived certain of the sons of Judah and of the sons of Benjamin. Of the sons of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, son of Zechariah, son of Amariah, son of Shephatiah, son of Mahalalel, of the sons of Perez; 
NEH.11.5	and Ma-aseiah the son of Baruch, son of Col-hozeh, son of Hazaiah, son of Adaiah, son of Joiarib, son of Zechariah, son of the Shilonite.

NEH.11.8	And after him Gabbai, Sallai, nine hundred and twenty-eight.

NEH.11.19	The gatekeepers, Akkub, Talmon and their brethren, who kept watch at the gates, were a hundred and seventy-two. 
NEH.11.20	And the rest of Israel, and of the priests and the Levites, were in all the towns of Judah, every one in his inheritance. 
NEH.11.21	But the temple servants lived on Ophel; and Ziha and Gishpa were over the temple servants.
NEH.11.22	The overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, son of Hashabiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Mica, of the sons of Asaph, the singers, over the work of the house of God. 
NEH.11.23	For there was a command from the king concerning them, and a settled provision for the singers, as every day required. 
NEH.11.24	And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the sons of Zerah the son of Judah, was at the king's hand in all matters concerning the people.
NEH.11.25	And as for the villages, with their fields, some of the people of Judah lived in Kiriath-arba and its villages, and in Dibon and its villages, and in Jekabzeel and its villages, 
NEH.11.26	and in Jeshua and in Moladah and Beth-pelet, 
NEH.11.27	in Hazar-shual, in Beer-sheba and its villages,

NEH.11.29	in En-rimmon, in Zorah, in Jarmuth, 
NEH.11.30	Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages, Lachish and its fields, and Azekah and its villages. So they encamped from Beer-sheba to the valley of Hinnom. 
NEH.11.31	The people of Benjamin also lived from Geba onward, at Michmash, Aija, Bethel and its villages, 
NEH.11.32	Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah, 
NEH.11.33	Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim, 
NEH.11.34	Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat, 
NEH.11.35	Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen. 
NEH.11.36	And certain divisions of the Levites in Judah were joined to Benjamin.
NEH.12.1	These are the priests and the Levites who came up with Zerubbabel the son of She-alti-el, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, 
NEH.12.2	Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, 
NEH.12.3	Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,

NEH.12.6	Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah, 
NEH.12.7	Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the chiefs of the priests and of their brethren in the days of Jeshua.
NEH.12.8	And the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmi-el, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who with his brethren was in charge of the songs of thanksgiving. 
NEH.12.9	And Bakbukiah and Unno their brethren stood opposite them in the service. 
NEH.12.10	And Jeshua was the father of Joiakim, Joiakim the father of Eliashib, Eliashib the father of Joiada, 
NEH.12.11	Joiada the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan the father of Jaddu-a.
NEH.12.12	And in the days of Joiakim were priests, heads of fathers' houses: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah; 
NEH.12.13	of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan; 
NEH.12.14	of Malluchi, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph; 
NEH.12.15	of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai; 
NEH.12.16	of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam; 
NEH.12.17	of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai;

NEH.12.20	of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber; 
NEH.12.21	of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel.
NEH.12.22	As for the Levites, in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddu-a, there were recorded the heads of fathers' houses; also the priests until the reign of Darius the Persian. 
NEH.12.23	The sons of Levi, heads of fathers' houses, were written in the Book of the Chronicles until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib. 
NEH.12.24	And the chiefs of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmi-el, with their brethren over against them, to praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, watch corresponding to watch. 
NEH.12.25	Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers standing guard at the storehouses of the gates. 
NEH.12.26	These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priest the scribe.
NEH.12.27	And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites in all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication with gladness, with thanksgivings and with singing, with cymbals, harps, and lyres. 
NEH.12.28	And the sons of the singers gathered together from the circuit round Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites; 
NEH.12.29	also from Beth-gilgal and from the region of Geba and Azmaveth; for the singers had built for themselves villages around Jerusalem. 
NEH.12.30	And the priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people and the gates and the wall.
NEH.12.31	Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies which gave thanks and went in procession. One went to the right upon the wall to the Dung Gate; 
NEH.12.32	and after them went Hoshaiah and half of the princes of Judah, 
NEH.12.33	and Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 
NEH.12.34	Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah, 
NEH.12.35	and certain of the priests' sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, son of Shemaiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Micaiah, son of Zaccur, son of Asaph; 
NEH.12.36	and his kinsmen, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe went before them. 
NEH.12.37	At the Fountain Gate they went up straight before them by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, to the Water Gate on the east.
NEH.12.38	The other company of those who gave thanks went to the left, and I followed them with half of the people, upon the wall, above the Tower of the Ovens, to the Broad Wall, 
NEH.12.39	and above the Gate of Ephraim, and by the Old Gate, and by the Fish Gate and the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, to the Sheep Gate; and they came to a halt at the Gate of the Guard. 
NEH.12.40	So both companies of those who gave thanks stood in the house of God, and I and half of the officials with me; 
NEH.12.41	and the priests Eliakim, Ma-aseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Eli-o-enai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets; 
NEH.12.42	and Ma-aseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang with Jezrahiah as their leader. 
NEH.12.43	And they offered great sacrifices that day and rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice with great joy; the women and children also rejoiced. And the joy of Jerusalem was heard afar off.
NEH.12.44	On that day men were appointed over the chambers for the stores, the contributions, the first fruits, and the tithes, to gather into them the portions required by the law for the priests and for the Levites according to the fields of the towns; for Judah rejoiced over the priests and the Levites who ministered. 
NEH.12.45	And they performed the service of their God and the service of purification, as did the singers and the gatekeepers, according to the command of David and his son Solomon. 
NEH.12.46	For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and there were songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. 
NEH.12.47	And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah gave the daily portions for the singers and the gatekeepers; and they set apart that which was for the Levites; and the Levites set apart that which was for the sons of Aaron.
NEH.13.2	for they did not meet the children of Israel with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them—yet our God turned the curse into a blessing. 
NEH.13.3	When the people heard the law, they separated from Israel all those of foreign descent.
NEH.13.4	Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, and who was connected with Tobiah, 
NEH.13.5	prepared for Tobiah a large chamber where they had previously put the cereal offering, the frankincense, the vessels, and the tithes of grain, wine, and oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers, and the contributions for the priests. 
NEH.13.6	While this was taking place I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Ar-ta-xerxes king of Babylon I went to the king. And after some time I asked leave of the king 
NEH.13.7	and came to Jerusalem, and I then discovered the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, preparing for him a chamber in the courts of the house of God. 
NEH.13.8	And I was very angry, and I threw all the household furniture of Tobiah out of the chamber. 
NEH.13.9	Then I gave orders and they cleansed the chambers; and I brought back thither the vessels of the house of God, with the cereal offering and the frankincense.
NEH.13.10	I also found out that the portions of the Levites had not been given to them; so that the Levites and the singers, who did the work, had fled each to his field. 
NEH.13.11	So I remonstrated with the officials and said, “Why is the house of God forsaken?” And I gathered them together and set them in their stations. 
NEH.13.12	Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain, wine, and oil into the storehouses. 
NEH.13.13	And I appointed as treasurers over the storehouses Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites, and as their assistant Hanan the son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, for they were counted faithful; and their duty was to distribute to their brethren. 
NEH.13.14	Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God and for his service.
NEH.13.15	In those days I saw in Judah men treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in heaps of grain and loading them on asses; and also wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day; and I warned them on the day when they sold food. 
NEH.13.16	Men of Tyre also, who lived in the city, brought in fish and all kinds of wares and sold them on the sabbath to the people of Judah, and in Jerusalem. 
NEH.13.17	Then I remonstrated with the nobles of Judah and said to them, “What is this evil thing which you are doing, profaning the sabbath day? 
NEH.13.18	Did not your fathers act in this way, and did not our God bring all this evil on us and on this city? Yet you bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.”
NEH.13.19	When it began to be dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut and gave orders that they should not be opened until after the sabbath. And I set some of my servants over the gates, that no burden might be brought in on the sabbath day. 
NEH.13.20	Then the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice. 
NEH.13.21	But I warned them and said to them, “Why do you lodge before the wall? If you do so again I will lay hands on you.” From that time on they did not come on the sabbath. 
NEH.13.22	And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves and come and guard the gates, to keep the sabbath day holy. Remember this also in my favor, O my God, and spare me according to the greatness of thy steadfast love.
NEH.13.23	In those days also I saw the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab; 
NEH.13.24	and half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and they could not speak the language of Judah, but the language of each people. 
NEH.13.25	And I contended with them and cursed them and beat some of them and pulled out their hair; and I made them take oath in the name of God, saying, “You shall not give your daughters to their sons, or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves. 
NEH.13.26	Did not Solomon king of Israel sin on account of such women? Among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel; nevertheless foreign women made even him to sin. 
NEH.13.27	Shall we then listen to you and do all this great evil and act treacherously against our God by marrying foreign women?”
NEH.13.28	And one of the sons of Jehoiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite; therefore I chased him from me. 
NEH.13.29	Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.
NEH.13.30	Thus I cleansed them from everything foreign, and I established the duties of the priests and Levites, each in his work; 
NEH.13.31	and I provided for the wood offering, at appointed times, and for the first fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.
EST.1.1	In the days of Ahasu-erus, the Ahasu-erus who reigned from India to Ethiopia over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces, 
EST.1.2	in those days when King Ahasu-erus sat on his royal throne in Susa the capital, 
EST.1.3	in the third year of his reign he gave a banquet for all his princes and servants, the army chiefs
EST.1.4	while he showed the riches of his royal glory and the splendor and pomp of his majesty for many days, a hundred and eighty days. 
EST.1.5	And when these days were completed, the king gave for all the people present in Susa the capital, both great and small, a banquet lasting for seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace. 
EST.1.6	There were white cotton curtains and blue hangings caught up with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings
EST.1.7	Drinks were served in golden goblets, goblets of different kinds, and the royal wine was lavished according to the bounty of the king. 
EST.1.8	And drinking was according to the law, no one was compelled; for the king had given orders to all the officials of his palace to do as every man desired. 
EST.1.9	Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the palace which belonged to King Ahasu-erus.
EST.1.10	On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha and Abagtha, Zethar and Carkas, the seven eunuchs who served King Ahasu-erus as chamberlains, 
EST.1.11	to bring Queen Vashti before the king with her royal crown, in order to show the peoples and the princes her beauty; for she was fair to behold. 
EST.1.12	But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's command conveyed by the eunuchs. At this the king was enraged, and his anger burned within him.
EST.1.13	Then the king said to the wise men who knew the times—for this was the king's procedure toward all who were versed in law and judgment, 
EST.1.14	the men next to him being Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, and sat first in the kingdom—: 
EST.1.15	“According to the law, what is to be done to Queen Vashti, because she has not performed the command of King Ahasu-erus conveyed by the eunuchs?” 
EST.1.16	Then Memucan said in presence of the king and the princes, “Not only to the king has Queen Vashti done wrong, but also to all the princes and all the peoples who are in all the provinces of King Ahasu-erus. 
EST.1.17	For this deed of the queen will be made known to all women, causing them to look with contempt upon their husbands, since they will say, ‘King Ahasu-erus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, and she did not come.’ 
EST.1.18	This very day the ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen's behavior will be telling it to all the king's princes, and there will be contempt and wrath in plenty. 
EST.1.19	If it please the king, let a royal order go forth from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes so that it may not be altered, that Vashti is to come no more before King Ahasu-erus; and let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she. 
EST.1.20	So when the decree made by the king is proclaimed throughout all his kingdom, vast as it is, all women will give honor to their husbands, high and low.” 
EST.1.21	This advice pleased the king and the princes, and the king did as Memucan proposed; 
EST.1.22	he sent letters to all the royal provinces, to every province in its own script and to every people in its own language, that every man be lord in his own house and speak according to the language of his people.
EST.2.1	After these things, when the anger of King Ahasu-erus had abated, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decreed against her. 
EST.2.2	Then the king's servants who attended him said, “Let beautiful young virgins be sought out for the king. 
EST.2.3	And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom to gather all the beautiful young virgins to the harem in Susa the capital, under custody of Hegai the king's eunuch who is in charge of the women; let their ointments be given them. 
EST.2.4	And let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.” This pleased the king, and he did so.
EST.2.5	Now there was a Jew in Susa the capital whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, son of Shime-i, son of Kish, a Benjaminite, 
EST.2.6	who had been carried away from Jerusalem among the captives carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away. 
EST.2.7	He had brought up Hadassah, that is Esther, the daughter of his uncle, for she had neither father nor mother; the maiden was beautiful and lovely, and when her father and her mother died, Mordecai adopted her as his own daughter. 
EST.2.8	So when the king's order and his edict were proclaimed, and when many maidens were gathered in Susa the capital in custody of Hegai, Esther also was taken into the king's palace and put in custody of Hegai who had charge of the women. 
EST.2.9	And the maiden pleased him and won his favor; and he quickly provided her with her ointments and her portion of food, and with seven chosen maids from the king's palace, and advanced her and her maids to the best place in the harem. 
EST.2.10	Esther had not made known her people or kindred, for Mordecai had charged her not to make it known. 
EST.2.11	And every day Mordecai walked in front of the court of the harem, to learn how Esther was and how she fared.
EST.2.12	Now when the turn came for each maiden to go in to King Ahasu-erus, after being twelve months under the regulations for the women, since this was the regular period of their beautifying, six months with oil of myrrh and six months with spices and ointments for women— 
EST.2.13	when the maiden went in to the king in this way she was given whatever she desired to take with her from the harem to the king's palace. 
EST.2.14	In the evening she went, and in the morning she came back to the second harem in custody of Sha-ashgaz the king's eunuch who was in charge of the concubines; she did not go in to the king again, unless the king delighted in her and she was summoned by name.
EST.2.15	When the turn came for Esther the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had adopted her as his own daughter, to go in to the king, she asked for nothing except what Hegai the king's eunuch, who had charge of the women, advised. Now Esther found favor in the eyes of all who saw her. 
EST.2.16	And when Esther was taken to King Ahasu-erus into his royal palace in the tenth month, which is the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign, 
EST.2.17	the king loved Esther more than all the women, and she found grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. 
EST.2.18	Then the king gave a great banquet to all his princes and servants; it was Esther's banquet. He also granted a remission of taxes
EST.2.19	When the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate. 
EST.2.20	Now Esther had not made known her kindred or her people, as Mordecai had charged her; for Esther obeyed Mordecai just as when she was brought up by him. 
EST.2.21	And in those days, as Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, became angry and sought to lay hands on King Ahasu-erus. 
EST.2.22	And this came to the knowledge of Mordecai, and he told it to Queen Esther, and Esther told the king in the name of Mordecai. 
EST.2.23	When the affair was investigated and found to be so, the men were both hanged on the gallows. And it was recorded in the Book of the Chronicles in the presence of the king.
EST.3.1	After these things King Ahasu-erus promoted Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes who were with him. 
EST.3.2	And all the king's servants who were at the king's gate bowed down and did obeisance to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not bow down or do obeisance. 
EST.3.3	Then the king's servants who were at the king's gate said to Mordecai, “Why do you transgress the king's command?” 
EST.3.4	And when they spoke to him day after day and he would not listen to them, they told Haman, in order to see whether Mordecai's words would avail; for he had told them that he was a Jew. 
EST.3.5	And when Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down or do obeisance to him, Haman was filled with fury. 
EST.3.6	But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone. So, as they had made known to him the people of Mordecai, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasu-erus.
EST.3.7	In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasu-erus, they cast Pur, that is the lot, before Haman day after day; and they cast it month after month till the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar. 
EST.3.8	Then Haman said to King Ahasu-erus, “There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from those of every other people, and they do not keep the king's laws, so that it is not for the king's profit to tolerate them. 
EST.3.9	If it please the king, let it be decreed that they be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who have charge of the king's business, that they may put it into the king's treasuries.” 
EST.3.10	So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. 
EST.3.11	And the king said to Haman, “The money is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.”
EST.3.12	Then the king's secretaries were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and an edict, according to all that Haman commanded, was written to the king's satraps and to the governors over all the provinces and to the princes of all the peoples, to every province in its own script and every people in its own language; it was written in the name of King Ahasu-erus and sealed with the king's ring. 
EST.3.13	Letters were sent by couriers to all the king's provinces, to destroy, to slay, and to annihilate all Jews, young and old, women and children, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods. 
EST.3.14	A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province by proclamation to all the peoples to be ready for that day. 
EST.3.15	The couriers went in haste by order of the king, and the decree was issued in Susa the capital. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Susa was perplexed.
EST.4.1	When Mordecai learned all that had been done, Mordecai rent his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, wailing with a loud and bitter cry; 
EST.4.2	he went up to the entrance of the king's gate, for no one might enter the king's gate clothed with sackcloth. 
EST.4.3	And in every province, wherever the king's command and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting and weeping and lamenting, and most of them lay in sackcloth and ashes.
EST.4.4	When Esther's maids and her eunuchs came and told her, the queen was deeply distressed; she sent garments to clothe Mordecai, so that he might take off his sackcloth, but he would not accept them. 
EST.4.5	Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs, who had been appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what this was and why it was. 
EST.4.6	Hathach went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king's gate, 
EST.4.7	and Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king's treasuries for the destruction of the Jews. 
EST.4.8	Mordecai also gave him a copy of the written decree issued in Susa for their destruction, that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her and charge her to go to the king to make supplication to him and entreat him for her people. 
EST.4.9	And Hathach went and told Esther what Mordecai had said. 
EST.4.10	Then Esther spoke to Hathach and gave him a message for Mordecai, saying, 
EST.4.11	“All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces know that if any man or woman goes to the king inside the inner court without being called, there is but one law; all alike are to be put to death, except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter that he may live. And I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.” 
EST.4.12	And they told Mordecai what Esther had said. 
EST.4.13	Then Mordecai told them to return answer to Esther, “Think not that in the king's palace you will escape any more than all the other Jews. 
EST.4.14	For if you keep silence at such a time as this, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another quarter, but you and your father's house will perish. And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?” 
EST.4.15	Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai, 
EST.4.16	“Go, gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, and hold a fast on my behalf, and neither eat nor drink for three days, night or day. I and my maids will also fast as you do. Then I will go to the king, though it is against the law; and if I perish, I perish.” 
EST.4.17	Mordecai then went away and did everything as Esther had ordered him.
EST.5.1	On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king's palace, opposite the king's hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne inside the palace opposite the entrance to the palace; 
EST.5.2	and when the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she found favor in his sight and he held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. Then Esther approached and touched the top of the scepter. 
EST.5.3	 And the king said to her, “What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you, even to the half of my kingdom.” 
EST.5.4	And Esther said, “If it please the king, let the king and Haman come this day to a dinner that I have prepared for the king.” 
EST.5.5	Then said the king, “Bring Haman quickly, that we may do as Esther desires.” So the king and Haman came to the dinner that Esther had prepared. 
EST.5.6	And as they were drinking wine, the king said to Esther, “What is your petition? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled.” 
EST.5.7	But Esther said, “My petition and my request is: 
EST.5.8	If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition and fulfil my request, let the king and Haman come tomorrow
EST.5.9	And Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he neither rose nor trembled before him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai. 
EST.5.10	Nevertheless Haman restrained himself, and went home; and he sent and fetched his friends and his wife Zeresh. 
EST.5.11	And Haman recounted to them the splendor of his riches, the number of his sons, all the promotions with which the king had honored him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and the servants of the king. 
EST.5.12	And Haman added, “Even Queen Esther let no one come with the king to the banquet she prepared but myself. And tomorrow also I am invited by her together with the king. 
EST.5.13	Yet all this does me no good, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.” 
EST.5.14	Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, “Let a gallows fifty cubits high be made, and in the morning tell the king to have Mordecai hanged upon it; then go merrily with the king to the dinner.” This counsel pleased Haman, and he had the gallows made.
EST.6.1	On that night the king could not sleep; and he gave orders to bring the book of memorable deeds, the chronicles, and they were read before the king. 
EST.6.2	And it was found written how Mordecai had told about Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, and who had sought to lay hands upon King Ahasu-erus. 
EST.6.3	And the king said, “What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?” The king's servants who attended him said, “Nothing has been done for him.” 
EST.6.4	And the king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king's palace to speak to the king about having Mordecai hanged on the gallows that he had prepared for him. 
EST.6.5	So the king's servants told him, “Haman is there, standing in the court.” And the king said, “Let him come in.” 
EST.6.6	So Haman came in, and the king said to him, “What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor?” And Haman said to himself, “Whom would the king delight to honor more than me?” 
EST.6.7	And Haman said to the king, “For the man whom the king delights to honor, 
EST.6.8	let royal robes be brought, which the king has worn, and the horse which the king has ridden, and on whose head a royal crown is set; 
EST.6.9	and let the robes and the horse be handed over to one of the king's most noble princes; let him
EST.6.10	Then the king said to Haman, “Make haste, take the robes and the horse, as you have said, and do so to Mordecai the Jew who sits at the king's gate. Leave out nothing that you have mentioned.” 
EST.6.11	So Haman took the robes and the horse, and he arrayed Mordecai and made him ride through the open square of the city, proclaiming, “Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.”
EST.6.12	Then Mordecai returned to the king's gate. But Haman hurried to his house, mourning and with his head covered. 
EST.6.13	And Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had befallen him. Then his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, “If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of the Jewish people, you will not prevail against him but will surely fall before him.”
EST.6.14	While they were yet talking with him, the king's eunuchs arrived and brought Haman in haste to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
EST.7.1	So the king and Haman went in to feast with Queen Esther. 
EST.7.2	 And on the second day, as they were drinking wine, the king again said to Esther, “What is your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled.” 
EST.7.3	Then Queen Esther answered, “If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request. 
EST.7.4	For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to be annihilated. If we had been sold merely as slaves, men and women, I would have held my peace; for our affliction is not to be compared with the loss to the king.” 
EST.7.5	Then King Ahasu-erus said to Queen Esther, “Who is he, and where is he, that would presume to do this?” 
EST.7.6	And Esther said, “A foe and enemy! This wicked Haman!” Then Haman was in terror before the king and the queen. 
EST.7.7	And the king rose from the feast in wrath and went into the palace garden; but Haman stayed to beg his life from Queen Esther, for he saw that evil was determined against him by the king. 
EST.7.8	And the king returned from the palace garden to the place where they were drinking wine, as Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was; and the king said, “Will he even assault the queen in my presence, in my own house?” As the words left the mouth of the king, they covered Haman's face. 
EST.7.9	Then said Harbona, one of the eunuchs in attendance on the king, “Moreover, the gallows which Haman has prepared for Mordecai, whose word saved the king, is standing in Haman's house, fifty cubits high.” 
EST.7.10	And the king said, “Hang him on that.” So they hanged Haman on the gallows which he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the anger of the king abated.
EST.8.1	On that day King Ahasu-erus gave to Queen Esther the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told what he was to her; 
EST.8.2	and the king took off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
EST.8.3	Then Esther spoke again to the king; she fell at his feet and besought him with tears to avert the evil design of Haman the Agagite and the plot which he had devised against the Jews. 
EST.8.4	And the king held out the golden scepter to Esther, 
EST.8.5	and Esther rose and stood before the king. And she said, “If it please the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and if the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let an order be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the provinces of the king. 
EST.8.6	For how can I endure to see the calamity that is coming to my people? Or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?” 
EST.8.7	Then King Ahasu-erus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows, because he would lay hands on the Jews. 
EST.8.8	And you may write as you please with regard to the Jews, in the name of the king, and seal it with the king's ring; for an edict written in the name of the king and sealed with the king's ring cannot be revoked.”
EST.8.9	The king's secretaries were summoned at that time, in the third month, which is the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third day; and an edict was written according to all that Mordecai commanded concerning the Jews to the satraps and the governors and the princes of the provinces from India to Ethiopia, a hundred and twenty-seven provinces, to every province in its own script and to every people in its own language, and also to the Jews in their script and their language. 
EST.8.10	The writing was in the name of King Ahasu-erus and sealed with the king's ring, and letters were sent by mounted couriers riding on swift horses that were used in the king's service, bred from the royal stud. 
EST.8.11	By these the king allowed the Jews who were in every city to gather and defend their lives, to destroy, to slay, and to annihilate any armed force of any people or province that might attack them, with their children and women, and to plunder their goods, 
EST.8.12	upon one day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasu-erus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar. 
EST.8.13	A copy of what was written was to be issued as a decree in every province, and by proclamation to all peoples, and the Jews were to be ready on that day to avenge themselves upon their enemies. 
EST.8.14	So the couriers, mounted on their swift horses that were used in the king's service, rode out in haste, urged by the king's command; and the decree was issued in Susa the capital.
EST.8.15	Then Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal robes of blue and white, with a great golden crown and a mantle of fine linen and purple, while the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced. 
EST.8.16	The Jews had light and gladness and joy and honor. 
EST.8.17	And in every province and in every city, wherever the king's command and his edict came, there was gladness and joy among the Jews, a feast and a holiday. And many from the peoples of the country declared themselves Jews, for the fear of the Jews had fallen upon them.
EST.9.1	Now in the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's command and edict were about to be executed, on the very day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to get the mastery over them, but which had been changed to a day when the Jews should get the mastery over their foes, 
EST.9.2	the Jews gathered in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasu-erus to lay hands on such as sought their hurt. And no one could make a stand against them, for the fear of them had fallen upon all peoples. 
EST.9.3	All the princes of the provinces and the satraps and the governors and the royal officials also helped the Jews, for the fear of Mordecai had fallen upon them. 
EST.9.4	For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai grew more and more powerful. 
EST.9.5	So the Jews smote all their enemies with the sword, slaughtering, and destroying them, and did as they pleased to those who hated them. 
EST.9.6	In Susa the capital itself the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men, 
EST.9.7	and also slew Parshan-datha and Dalphon and Aspatha 
EST.9.8	and Poratha and Adalia and Aridatha 
EST.9.9	and Parmashta and Arisai and Aridai and Vaizatha, 
EST.9.10	the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews; but they laid no hand on the plunder.
EST.9.11	That very day the number of those slain in Susa the capital was reported to the king. 
EST.9.12	And the king said to Queen Esther, “In Susa the capital the Jews have slain five hundred men and also the ten sons of Haman. What then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces! Now what is your petition? It shall be granted you. And what further is your request? It shall be fulfilled.” 
EST.9.13	And Esther said, “If it please the king, let the Jews who are in Susa be allowed tomorrow also to do according to this day's edict. And let the ten sons of Haman be hanged on the gallows.” 
EST.9.14	So the king commanded this to be done; a decree was issued in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman were hanged. 
EST.9.15	The Jews who were in Susa gathered also on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and they slew three hundred men in Susa; but they laid no hands on the plunder.
EST.9.16	Now the other Jews who were in the king's provinces also gathered to defend their lives, and got relief from their enemies, and slew seventy-five thousand of those who hated them; but they laid no hands on the plunder. 
EST.9.17	This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth day they rested and made that a day of feasting and gladness. 
EST.9.18	But the Jews who were in Susa gathered on the thirteenth day and on the fourteenth, and rested on the fifteenth day, making that a day of feasting and gladness. 
EST.9.19	Therefore the Jews of the villages, who live in the open towns, hold the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day for gladness and feasting and holiday-making, and a day on which they send choice portions to one another.
EST.9.20	And Mordecai recorded these things, and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasu-erus, both near and far, 
EST.9.21	enjoining them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar and also the fifteenth day of the same, year by year, 
EST.9.22	as the days on which the Jews got relief from their enemies, and as the month that had been turned for them from sorrow into gladness and from mourning into a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, days for sending choice portions to one another and gifts to the poor.
EST.9.23	So the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written to them. 
EST.9.24	For Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to crush and destroy them; 
EST.9.25	but when Esther came before the king, he gave orders in writing that his wicked plot which he had devised against the Jews should come upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows. 
EST.9.26	Therefore they called these days Purim, after the term Pur. And therefore, because of all that was written in this letter, and of what they had faced in this matter, and of what had befallen them, 
EST.9.27	the Jews ordained and took it upon themselves and their descendants and all who joined them, that without fail they would keep these two days according to what was written and at the time appointed every year, 
EST.9.28	that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, in every family, province, and city, and that these days of Purim should never fall into disuse among the Jews, nor should the commemoration of these days cease among their descendants.
EST.9.29	Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew gave full written authority, confirming this second letter about Purim. 
EST.9.30	Letters were sent to all the Jews, to the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasu-erus, in words of peace and truth, 
EST.9.31	that these days of Purim should be observed at their appointed seasons, as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther enjoined upon the Jews, and as they had laid down for themselves and for their descendants, with regard to their fasts and their lamenting. 
EST.9.32	The command of Queen Esther fixed these practices of Purim, and it was recorded in writing.
EST.10.1	King Ahasu-erus laid tribute on the land and on the coastlands of the sea. 
EST.10.2	And all the acts of his power and might, and the full account of the high honor of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia? 
EST.10.3	For Mordecai the Jew was next in rank to King Ahasu-erus, and he was great among the Jews and popular with the multitude of his brethren, for he sought the welfare of his people and spoke peace to all his people.
JOB.1.1	There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was blameless and upright, one who feared God, and turned away from evil. 
JOB.1.2	There were born to him seven sons and three daughters. 
JOB.1.3	He had seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and very many servants; so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the east. 
JOB.1.4	His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each on his day; and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. 
JOB.1.5	And when the days of the feast had run their course, Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, “It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts.” Thus Job did continually.
JOB.1.6	Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the 
JOB.1.7	The 
JOB.1.8	And the 
JOB.1.9	Then Satan answered the 
JOB.1.10	Hast thou not put a hedge about him and his house and all that he has, on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. 
JOB.1.11	But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will curse thee to thy face.” 
JOB.1.12	And the 
JOB.1.13	Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house; 
JOB.1.14	and there came a messenger to Job, and said, “The oxen were plowing and the asses feeding beside them; 
JOB.1.15	and the Sabeans fell upon them and took them, and slew the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you.” 
JOB.1.16	While he was yet speaking, there came another, and said, “The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell you.” 
JOB.1.17	While he was yet speaking, there came another, and said, “The Chaldeans formed three companies, and made a raid upon the camels and took them, and slew the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you.” 
JOB.1.18	While he was yet speaking, there came another, and said, “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house; 
JOB.1.19	and behold, a great wind came across the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
JOB.1.20	Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell upon the ground, and worshiped. 
JOB.1.21	And he said, “Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return; the 
JOB.1.22	In all this Job did not sin or charge God with wrong.
JOB.2.1	Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the 
JOB.2.2	And the 
JOB.2.3	And the 
JOB.2.4	Then Satan answered the 
JOB.2.5	But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.” 
JOB.2.6	And the 
JOB.2.7	So Satan went forth from the presence of the 
JOB.2.8	And he took a potsherd with which to scrape himself, and sat among the ashes.
JOB.2.9	Then his wife said to him, “Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God, and die.” 
JOB.2.10	But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?” In all this Job did not sin with his lips.
JOB.2.11	Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, they came each from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They made an appointment together to come to condole with him and comfort him. 
JOB.2.12	And when they saw him from afar, they did not recognize him; and they raised their voices and wept; and they rent their robes and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven. 
JOB.2.13	And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his suffering was very great.
JOB.3.1	After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth. 
JOB.3.2	And Job said:
JOB.3.3	and the night which said,
JOB.3.3	‘A man-child is conceived.’
JOB.3.4	Let that day be darkness!
JOB.3.4	May God above not seek it,
JOB.3.4	nor light shine upon it.
JOB.3.5	Let gloom and deep darkness claim it.
JOB.3.5	Let clouds dwell upon it;
JOB.3.5	let the blackness of the day terrify it.
JOB.3.6	That night—let thick darkness seize it!
JOB.3.6	let it not rejoice among the days of the year,
JOB.3.6	let it not come into the number of the months.
JOB.3.7	Yea, let that night be barren;
JOB.3.7	let no joyful cry be heard
JOB.3.8	Let those curse it who curse the day,
JOB.3.8	who are skilled to rouse up Leviathan.
JOB.3.9	Let the stars of its dawn be dark;
JOB.3.9	let it hope for light, but have none,
JOB.3.9	nor see the eyelids of the morning;
JOB.3.10	because it did not shut the doors of my mother's womb,
JOB.3.10	nor hide trouble from my eyes.
JOB.3.11	“Why did I not die at birth,
JOB.3.11	come forth from the womb and expire?
JOB.3.12	Why did the knees receive me?
JOB.3.12	Or why the breasts, that I should suck?
JOB.3.13	For then I should have lain down and been quiet;
JOB.3.13	I should have slept; then I should have been at rest,
JOB.3.14	with kings and counselors of the earth
JOB.3.14	who rebuilt ruins for themselves,
JOB.3.15	or with princes who had gold,
JOB.3.15	who filled their houses with silver.
JOB.3.16	Or why was I not as a hidden untimely birth,
JOB.3.16	as infants that never see the light?
JOB.3.17	There the wicked cease from troubling,
JOB.3.17	and there the weary are at rest.
JOB.3.18	There the prisoners are at ease together;
JOB.3.18	they hear not the voice of the taskmaster.
JOB.3.19	The small and the great are there,
JOB.3.19	and the slave is free from his master.
JOB.3.20	“Why is light given to him that is in misery,
JOB.3.20	and life to the bitter in soul,
JOB.3.21	who long for death, but it comes not,
JOB.3.21	and dig for it more than for hid treasures;
JOB.3.22	who rejoice exceedingly,
JOB.3.22	and are glad, when they find the grave?
JOB.3.23	Why is light given to a man whose way is hid,
JOB.3.23	whom God has hedged in?
JOB.3.24	For my sighing comes as
JOB.3.24	and my groanings are poured out like water.
JOB.3.25	For the thing that I fear comes upon me,
JOB.3.25	and what I dread befalls me.
JOB.3.26	I am not at ease, nor am I quiet;
JOB.3.26	I have no rest; but trouble comes.”
JOB.4.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:
JOB.4.2	“If one ventures a word with you, will you be offended?
JOB.4.2	Yet who can keep from speaking?
JOB.4.3	Behold, you have instructed many,
JOB.4.3	and you have strengthened the weak hands.
JOB.4.4	Your words have upheld him who was stumbling,
JOB.4.4	and you have made firm the feeble knees.
JOB.4.5	But now it has come to you, and you are impatient;
JOB.4.5	it touches you, and you are dismayed.
JOB.4.6	Is not your fear of God your confidence,
JOB.4.6	and the integrity of your ways your hope?
JOB.4.7	“Think now, who that was innocent ever perished?
JOB.4.7	Or where were the upright cut off?
JOB.4.8	As I have seen, those who plow iniquity
JOB.4.8	and sow trouble reap the same.
JOB.4.9	By the breath of God they perish,
JOB.4.9	and by the blast of his anger they are consumed.
JOB.4.10	The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion,
JOB.4.10	the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
JOB.4.11	The strong lion perishes for lack of prey,
JOB.4.11	and the whelps of the lioness are scattered.
JOB.4.12	“Now a word was brought to me stealthily,
JOB.4.12	my ear received the whisper of it.
JOB.4.13	Amid thoughts from visions of the night,
JOB.4.13	when deep sleep falls on men,
JOB.4.14	dread came upon me, and trembling,
JOB.4.14	which made all my bones shake.
JOB.4.15	A spirit glided past my face;
JOB.4.15	the hair of my flesh stood up.
JOB.4.16	It stood still,
JOB.4.16	but I could not discern its appearance.
JOB.4.16	A form was before my eyes;
JOB.4.16	there was silence, then I heard a voice:
JOB.4.17	‘Can mortal man be righteous before
JOB.4.17	Can a man be pure before
JOB.4.18	Even in his servants he puts no trust,
JOB.4.18	and his angels he charges with error;
JOB.4.19	how much more those who dwell in houses of clay,
JOB.4.19	whose foundation is in the dust,
JOB.4.19	who are crushed before the moth.
JOB.4.20	Between morning and evening they are destroyed;
JOB.4.20	they perish for ever without any regarding it.
JOB.4.21	If their tent-cord is plucked up within them,
JOB.4.21	do they not die, and that without wisdom?’
JOB.5.1	“Call now; is there any one who will answer you?
JOB.5.1	To which of the holy ones will you turn?
JOB.5.2	Surely vexation kills the fool,
JOB.5.2	and jealousy slays the simple.
JOB.5.3	I have seen the fool taking root,
JOB.5.3	but suddenly I cursed his dwelling.
JOB.5.4	His sons are far from safety,
JOB.5.4	they are crushed in the gate,
JOB.5.4	and there is no one to deliver them.
JOB.5.5	His harvest the hungry eat,
JOB.5.5	and he takes it even out of thorns;
JOB.5.5	and the thirsty
JOB.5.6	For affliction does not come from the dust,
JOB.5.6	nor does trouble sprout from the ground;
JOB.5.7	but man is born to trouble
JOB.5.7	as the sparks fly upward.
JOB.5.8	“As for me, I would seek God,
JOB.5.8	and to God would I commit my cause;
JOB.5.9	who does great things and unsearchable,
JOB.5.9	marvelous things without number:
JOB.5.10	he gives rain upon the earth
JOB.5.10	and sends waters upon the fields;
JOB.5.11	he sets on high those who are lowly,
JOB.5.11	and those who mourn are lifted to safety.
JOB.5.12	so that their hands achieve no success.
JOB.5.13	He takes the wise in their own craftiness;
JOB.5.13	and the schemes of the wily are brought to a quick end.
JOB.5.14	They meet with darkness in the daytime,
JOB.5.14	and grope at noonday as in the night.
JOB.5.15	But he saves the fatherless from their mouth,
JOB.5.15	the needy from the hand of the mighty.
JOB.5.16	So the poor have hope,
JOB.5.16	and injustice shuts her mouth.
JOB.5.17	“Behold, happy is the man whom God reproves;
JOB.5.17	therefore despise not the chastening of the Almighty.
JOB.5.18	For he wounds, but he binds up;
JOB.5.18	he smites, but his hands heal.
JOB.5.19	He will deliver you from six troubles;
JOB.5.19	in seven there shall no evil touch you.
JOB.5.20	In famine he will redeem you from death,
JOB.5.20	and in war from the power of the sword.
JOB.5.21	You shall be hid from the scourge of the tongue,
JOB.5.21	and shall not fear destruction when it comes.
JOB.5.22	At destruction and famine you shall laugh,
JOB.5.22	and shall not fear the beasts of the earth.
JOB.5.23	For you shall be in league with the stones of the field,
JOB.5.23	and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.
JOB.5.24	You shall know that your tent is safe,
JOB.5.24	and you shall inspect your fold and miss nothing.
JOB.5.25	You shall know also that your descendants shall be many,
JOB.5.25	and your offspring as the grass of the earth.
JOB.5.26	You shall come to your grave in ripe old age,
JOB.5.26	as a shock of grain comes up to the threshing floor in its season.
JOB.5.27	Lo, this we have searched out; it is true.
JOB.5.27	Hear, and know it for your good.”
JOB.6.1	Then Job answered:
JOB.6.2	“O that my vexation were weighed,
JOB.6.2	and all my calamity laid in the balances!
JOB.6.3	For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea;
JOB.6.3	therefore my words have been rash.
JOB.6.4	For the arrows of the Almighty are in me;
JOB.6.4	my spirit drinks their poison;
JOB.6.4	the terrors of God are arrayed against me.
JOB.6.5	Does the wild ass bray when he has grass,
JOB.6.5	or the ox low over his fodder?
JOB.6.6	Can that which is tasteless be eaten without salt,
JOB.6.6	or is there any taste in the slime of the purslane?
JOB.6.7	My appetite refuses to touch them;
JOB.6.7	they are as food that is loathsome to me.
JOB.6.8	“O that I might have my request,
JOB.6.8	and that God would grant my desire;
JOB.6.9	that it would please God to crush me,
JOB.6.9	that he would let loose his hand and cut me off!
JOB.6.10	This would be my consolation;
JOB.6.10	I would even exult
JOB.6.10	for I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
JOB.6.11	What is my strength, that I should wait?
JOB.6.11	And what is my end, that I should be patient?
JOB.6.12	Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh bronze?
JOB.6.13	In truth I have no help in me,
JOB.6.13	and any resource is driven from me.
JOB.6.14	“He who withholds
JOB.6.14	forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
JOB.6.15	My brethren are treacherous as a torrent-bed,
JOB.6.15	as freshets that pass away,
JOB.6.16	which are dark with ice,
JOB.6.16	and where the snow hides itself.
JOB.6.17	In time of heat they disappear;
JOB.6.17	when it is hot, they vanish from their place.
JOB.6.18	The caravans turn aside from their course;
JOB.6.18	they go up into the waste, and perish.
JOB.6.19	The caravans of Tema look,
JOB.6.19	the travelers of Sheba hope.
JOB.6.20	They are disappointed because they were confident;
JOB.6.20	they come thither and are confounded.
JOB.6.21	Such you have now become to me;
JOB.6.21	you see my calamity, and are afraid.
JOB.6.22	Have I said, ‘Make me a gift’?
JOB.6.22	Or, ‘From your wealth offer a bribe for me’?
JOB.6.23	Or, ‘Deliver me from the adversary's hand’?
JOB.6.23	Or, ‘Ransom me from the hand of oppressors’?
JOB.6.24	“Teach me, and I will be silent;
JOB.6.24	make me understand how I have erred.
JOB.6.25	How forceful are honest words!
JOB.6.25	But what does reproof from you reprove?
JOB.6.26	Do you think that you can reprove words,
JOB.6.26	when the speech of a despairing man is wind?
JOB.6.27	You would even cast lots over the fatherless,
JOB.6.27	and bargain over your friend.
JOB.6.28	“But now, be pleased to look at me;
JOB.6.28	for I will not lie to your face.
JOB.6.29	Turn, I pray, let no wrong be done.
JOB.6.29	Turn now, my vindication is at stake.
JOB.6.30	Is there any wrong on my tongue?
JOB.6.30	Cannot my taste discern calamity?
JOB.7.1	“Has not man a hard service upon earth,
JOB.7.1	and are not his days like the days of a hireling?
JOB.7.2	Like a slave who longs for the shadow,
JOB.7.2	and like a hireling who looks for his wages,
JOB.7.3	so I am allotted months of emptiness,
JOB.7.3	and nights of misery are apportioned to me.
JOB.7.4	When I lie down I say, ‘When shall I arise?’
JOB.7.4	But the night is long,
JOB.7.4	and I am full of tossing till the dawn.
JOB.7.5	My flesh is clothed with worms and dirt;
JOB.7.5	my skin hardens, then breaks out afresh.
JOB.7.6	My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle,
JOB.7.6	and come to their end without hope.
JOB.7.7	“Remember that my life is a breath;
JOB.7.7	my eye will never again see good.
JOB.7.8	The eye of him who sees me will behold me no more;
JOB.7.8	while thy eyes are upon me, I shall be gone.
JOB.7.9	As the cloud fades and vanishes,
JOB.7.9	so he who goes down to Sheol does not come up;
JOB.7.10	he returns no more to his house,
JOB.7.10	nor does his place know him any more.
JOB.7.11	“Therefore I will not restrain my mouth;
JOB.7.11	I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;
JOB.7.11	I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
JOB.7.12	Am I the sea, or a sea monster,
JOB.7.12	that thou settest a guard over me?
JOB.7.13	When I say, ‘My bed will comfort me,
JOB.7.13	my couch will ease my complaint,’
JOB.7.14	then thou dost scare me with dreams
JOB.7.14	and terrify me with visions,
JOB.7.15	so that I would choose strangling
JOB.7.15	and death rather than my bones.
JOB.7.16	I loathe my life; I would not live for ever.
JOB.7.16	Let me alone, for my days are a breath.
JOB.7.17	and that thou dost set thy mind upon him,
JOB.7.18	dost visit him every morning,
JOB.7.18	and test him every moment?
JOB.7.19	How long wilt thou not look away from me,
JOB.7.19	nor let me alone till I swallow my spittle?
JOB.7.20	If I sin, what do I do to thee, thou watcher of men?
JOB.7.20	Why hast thou made me thy mark?
JOB.7.20	Why have I become a burden to thee?
JOB.7.21	Why dost thou not pardon my transgression
JOB.7.21	and take away my iniquity?
JOB.7.21	For now I shall lie in the earth;
JOB.7.21	thou wilt seek me, but I shall not be.”
JOB.8.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite answered:
JOB.8.2	“How long will you say these things,
JOB.8.2	and the words of your mouth be a great wind?
JOB.8.3	Does God pervert justice?
JOB.8.3	Or does the Almighty pervert the right?
JOB.8.4	If your children have sinned against him,
JOB.8.4	he has delivered them into the power of their transgression.
JOB.8.5	If you will seek God
JOB.8.5	and make supplication to the Almighty,
JOB.8.6	if you are pure and upright,
JOB.8.6	surely then he will rouse himself for you
JOB.8.6	and reward you with a rightful habitation.
JOB.8.7	And though your beginning was small,
JOB.8.7	your latter days will be very great.
JOB.8.8	“For inquire, I pray you, of bygone ages,
JOB.8.8	and consider what the fathers have found;
JOB.8.9	for we are but of yesterday, and know nothing,
JOB.8.9	for our days on earth are a shadow.
JOB.8.10	Will they not teach you, and tell you,
JOB.8.10	and utter words out of their understanding?
JOB.8.11	“Can papyrus grow where there is no marsh?
JOB.8.11	Can reeds flourish where there is no water?
JOB.8.12	While yet in flower and not cut down,
JOB.8.12	they wither before any other plant.
JOB.8.13	Such are the paths of all who forget God;
JOB.8.13	the hope of the godless man shall perish.
JOB.8.14	His confidence breaks in sunder,
JOB.8.14	and his trust is a spider's web.
JOB.8.15	He leans against his house, but it does not stand;
JOB.8.15	he lays hold of it, but it does not endure.
JOB.8.16	He thrives before the sun,
JOB.8.16	and his shoots spread over his garden.
JOB.8.17	His roots twine about the stoneheap;
JOB.8.17	he lives among the rocks.
JOB.8.18	If he is destroyed from his place,
JOB.8.18	then it will deny him, saying, ‘I have never seen you.’
JOB.8.19	Behold, this is the joy of his way;
JOB.8.19	and out of the earth others will spring.
JOB.8.20	“Behold, God will not reject a blameless man,
JOB.8.20	nor take the hand of evildoers.
JOB.8.21	He will yet fill your mouth with laughter,
JOB.8.21	and your lips with shouting.
JOB.8.22	Those who hate you will be clothed with shame,
JOB.8.22	and the tent of the wicked will be no more.”
JOB.9.1	Then Job answered:
JOB.9.2	“Truly I know that it is so:
JOB.9.2	But how can a man be just before God?
JOB.9.3	If one wished to contend with him,
JOB.9.3	one could not answer him once in a thousand times.
JOB.9.4	He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength
JOB.9.4	—who has hardened himself against him, and succeeded?—
JOB.9.5	he who removes mountains, and they know it not,
JOB.9.5	when he overturns them in his anger;
JOB.9.6	who shakes the earth out of its place,
JOB.9.6	and its pillars tremble;
JOB.9.7	who commands the sun, and it does not rise;
JOB.9.7	who seals up the stars;
JOB.9.8	who alone stretched out the heavens,
JOB.9.8	and trampled the waves of the sea;
JOB.9.9	who made the Bear and Orion,
JOB.9.9	the Pleiades and the chambers of the south;
JOB.9.10	who does great things beyond understanding,
JOB.9.10	and marvelous things without number.
JOB.9.11	Lo, he passes by me, and I see him not;
JOB.9.11	he moves on, but I do not perceive him.
JOB.9.12	Behold, he snatches away; who can hinder him?
JOB.9.12	Who will say to him, ‘What doest thou?’
JOB.9.13	“God will not turn back his anger;
JOB.9.13	beneath him bowed the helpers of Rahab.
JOB.9.14	How then can I answer him,
JOB.9.14	choosing my words with him?
JOB.9.15	Though I am innocent, I cannot answer him;
JOB.9.15	I must appeal for mercy to my accuser.
JOB.9.16	If I summoned him and he answered me,
JOB.9.16	I would not believe that he was listening to my voice.
JOB.9.17	For he crushes me with a tempest,
JOB.9.17	and multiplies my wounds without cause;
JOB.9.18	he will not let me get my breath,
JOB.9.18	but fills me with bitterness.
JOB.9.19	If it is a contest of strength, behold him!
JOB.9.19	If it is a matter of justice, who can summon him?
JOB.9.20	Though I am innocent, my own mouth would condemn me;
JOB.9.20	though I am blameless, he would prove me perverse.
JOB.9.21	I am blameless; I regard not myself;
JOB.9.21	I loathe my life.
JOB.9.22	It is all one; therefore I say,
JOB.9.22	he destroys both the blameless and the wicked.
JOB.9.23	When disaster brings sudden death,
JOB.9.23	he mocks at the calamity
JOB.9.24	The earth is given into the hand of the wicked;
JOB.9.24	he covers the faces of its judges—
JOB.9.24	if it is not he, who then is it?
JOB.9.25	“My days are swifter than a runner;
JOB.9.25	they flee away, they see no good.
JOB.9.26	They go by like skiffs of reed,
JOB.9.26	like an eagle swooping on the prey.
JOB.9.27	If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint,
JOB.9.27	I will put off my sad countenance, and be of good cheer,’
JOB.9.28	I become afraid of all my suffering,
JOB.9.28	for I know thou wilt not hold me innocent.
JOB.9.29	I shall be condemned;
JOB.9.29	why then do I labor in vain?
JOB.9.30	If I wash myself with snow,
JOB.9.30	and cleanse my hands with lye,
JOB.9.31	yet thou wilt plunge me into a pit,
JOB.9.31	and my own clothes will abhor me.
JOB.9.32	For he is not a man, as I am, that I might answer him,
JOB.9.32	that we should come to trial together.
JOB.9.33	There is no
JOB.9.33	who might lay his hand upon us both.
JOB.9.34	Let him take his rod away from me,
JOB.9.34	and let not dread of him terrify me.
JOB.9.35	Then I would speak without fear of him,
JOB.9.35	for I am not so in myself.
JOB.10.1	“I loathe my life;
JOB.10.1	I will give free utterance to my complaint;
JOB.10.1	I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
JOB.10.2	I will say to God, Do not condemn me;
JOB.10.2	let me know why thou dost contend against me.
JOB.10.3	Does it seem good to thee to oppress,
JOB.10.3	to despise the work of thy hands
JOB.10.3	and favor the designs of the wicked?
JOB.10.4	Hast thou eyes of flesh?
JOB.10.4	Dost thou see as man sees?
JOB.10.5	Are thy days as the days of man,
JOB.10.5	or thy years as man's years,
JOB.10.6	that thou dost seek out my iniquity
JOB.10.6	and search for my sin,
JOB.10.7	although thou knowest that I am not guilty,
JOB.10.7	and there is none to deliver out of thy hand?
JOB.10.8	Thy hands fashioned and made me;
JOB.10.8	and now thou dost turn about and destroy me.
JOB.10.9	Remember that thou hast made me of clay;
JOB.10.9	and wilt thou turn me to dust again?
JOB.10.10	Didst thou not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese?
JOB.10.11	Thou didst clothe me with skin and flesh,
JOB.10.11	and knit me together with bones and sinews.
JOB.10.12	Thou hast granted me life and steadfast love;
JOB.10.12	and thy care has preserved my spirit.
JOB.10.13	Yet these things thou didst hide in thy heart;
JOB.10.13	I know that this was thy purpose.
JOB.10.14	If I sin, thou dost mark me,
JOB.10.14	and dost not acquit me of my iniquity.
JOB.10.15	If I am wicked, woe to me!
JOB.10.15	If I am righteous, I cannot lift up my head,
JOB.10.15	for I am filled with disgrace
JOB.10.15	and look upon my affliction.
JOB.10.16	And if I lift myself up,
JOB.10.16	and again work wonders against me;
JOB.10.17	thou dost renew thy witnesses against me,
JOB.10.17	and increase thy vexation toward me;
JOB.10.17	thou dost bring fresh hosts against me.
JOB.10.18	“Why didst thou bring me forth from the womb?
JOB.10.18	Would that I had died before any eye had seen me,
JOB.10.19	and were as though I had not been,
JOB.10.19	carried from the womb to the grave.
JOB.10.20	Are not the days of my life few?
JOB.10.20	Let me alone, that I may find a little comfort
JOB.10.21	before I go whence I shall not return,
JOB.10.21	to the land of gloom and deep darkness,
JOB.10.22	the land of gloom
JOB.10.22	where light is as darkness.”
JOB.11.1	Then Zophar the Naamathite answered:
JOB.11.2	“Should a multitude of words go unanswered,
JOB.11.2	and a man full of talk be vindicated?
JOB.11.3	Should your babble silence men,
JOB.11.3	and when you mock, shall no one shame you?
JOB.11.4	For you say, ‘My doctrine is pure,
JOB.11.4	and I am clean in God's eyes.’
JOB.11.5	But oh, that God would speak,
JOB.11.5	and open his lips to you,
JOB.11.6	and that he would tell you the secrets of wisdom!
JOB.11.6	For he is manifold in understanding.
JOB.11.6	Know then that God exacts of you less than your guilt deserves.
JOB.11.7	“Can you find out the deep things of God?
JOB.11.7	Can you find out the limit of the Almighty?
JOB.11.8	It is higher than heaven
JOB.11.8	Deeper than Sheol—what can you know?
JOB.11.9	Its measure is longer than the earth,
JOB.11.9	and broader than the sea.
JOB.11.10	If he passes through, and imprisons,
JOB.11.10	and calls to judgment, who can hinder him?
JOB.11.11	For he knows worthless men;
JOB.11.11	when he sees iniquity, will he not consider it?
JOB.11.12	But a stupid man will get understanding,
JOB.11.12	when a wild ass's colt is born a man.
JOB.11.13	“If you set your heart aright,
JOB.11.13	you will stretch out your hands toward him.
JOB.11.14	If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away,
JOB.11.14	and let not wickedness dwell in your tents.
JOB.11.15	Surely then you will lift up your face without blemish;
JOB.11.15	you will be secure, and will not fear.
JOB.11.16	You will forget your misery;
JOB.11.16	you will remember it as waters that have passed away.
JOB.11.17	And your life will be brighter than the noonday;
JOB.11.17	its darkness will be like the morning.
JOB.11.18	And you will have confidence, because there is hope;
JOB.11.18	you will be protected
JOB.11.19	You will lie down, and none will make you afraid;
JOB.11.19	many will entreat your favor.
JOB.11.20	But the eyes of the wicked will fail;
JOB.11.20	all way of escape will be lost to them,
JOB.11.20	and their hope is to breathe their last.”
JOB.12.1	Then Job answered:
JOB.12.2	“No doubt you are the people,
JOB.12.2	and wisdom will die with you.
JOB.12.3	But I have understanding as well as you;
JOB.12.3	I am not inferior to you.
JOB.12.3	Who does not know such things as these?
JOB.12.4	I am a laughingstock to my friends;
JOB.12.4	I, who called upon God and he answered me,
JOB.12.4	a just and blameless man, am a laughingstock.
JOB.12.5	In the thought of one who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune;
JOB.12.5	it is ready for those whose feet slip.
JOB.12.6	The tents of robbers are at peace,
JOB.12.6	and those who provoke God are secure,
JOB.12.6	who bring their god in their hand.
JOB.12.7	“But ask the beasts, and they will teach you;
JOB.12.7	the birds of the air, and they will tell you;
JOB.12.8	or the plants of the earth,
JOB.12.8	and the fish of the sea will declare to you.
JOB.12.9	Who among all these does not know
JOB.12.9	that the hand of the 
JOB.12.10	In his hand is the life of every living thing
JOB.12.10	and the breath of all mankind.
JOB.12.11	Does not the ear try words
JOB.12.11	as the palate tastes food?
JOB.12.12	Wisdom is with the aged,
JOB.12.12	and understanding in length of days.
JOB.12.13	“With God
JOB.12.13	he has counsel and understanding.
JOB.12.14	If he tears down, none can rebuild;
JOB.12.14	if he shuts a man in, none can open.
JOB.12.15	If he withholds the waters, they dry up;
JOB.12.15	if he sends them out, they overwhelm the land.
JOB.12.16	With him are strength and wisdom;
JOB.12.16	the deceived and the deceiver are his.
JOB.12.17	He leads counselors away stripped,
JOB.12.17	and judges he makes fools.
JOB.12.18	He looses the bonds of kings,
JOB.12.18	and binds a waistcloth on their loins.
JOB.12.19	He leads priests away stripped,
JOB.12.19	and overthrows the mighty.
JOB.12.20	He deprives of speech those who are trusted,
JOB.12.20	and takes away the discernment of the elders.
JOB.12.21	He pours contempt on princes,
JOB.12.21	and looses the belt of the strong.
JOB.12.22	He uncovers the deeps out of darkness,
JOB.12.22	and brings deep darkness to light.
JOB.12.23	He makes nations great, and he destroys them:
JOB.12.23	he enlarges nations, and leads them away.
JOB.12.24	He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth,
JOB.12.24	and makes them wander in a pathless waste.
JOB.12.25	They grope in the dark without light;
JOB.12.25	and he makes them stagger like a drunken man.
JOB.13.1	“Lo, my eye has seen all this, my ear has heard and understood it.
JOB.13.2	“What you know, I also know;
JOB.13.2	I am not inferior to you.
JOB.13.3	But I would speak to the Almighty,
JOB.13.3	and I desire to argue my case with God.
JOB.13.4	As for you, you whitewash with lies;
JOB.13.4	worthless physicians are you all.
JOB.13.5	Oh that you would keep silent,
JOB.13.5	and it would be your wisdom!
JOB.13.6	Hear now my reasoning,
JOB.13.6	and listen to the pleadings of my lips.
JOB.13.7	Will you speak falsely for God,
JOB.13.7	and speak deceitfully for him?
JOB.13.8	Will you show partiality toward him,
JOB.13.8	will you plead the case for God?
JOB.13.9	Will it be well with you when he searches you out?
JOB.13.9	Or can you deceive him, as one deceives a man?
JOB.13.10	He will surely rebuke you
JOB.13.10	if in secret you show partiality.
JOB.13.11	Will not his majesty terrify you,
JOB.13.11	and the dread of him fall upon you?
JOB.13.12	Your maxims are proverbs of ashes,
JOB.13.12	your defenses are defenses of clay.
JOB.13.13	“Let me have silence, and I will speak,
JOB.13.13	and let come on me what may.
JOB.13.14	I will take
JOB.13.14	and put my life in my hand.
JOB.13.15	Behold, he will slay me; I have no hope;
JOB.13.15	yet I will defend my ways to his face.
JOB.13.16	This will be my salvation,
JOB.13.16	that a godless man shall not come before him.
JOB.13.17	Listen carefully to my words,
JOB.13.17	and let my declaration be in your ears.
JOB.13.18	Behold, I have prepared my case;
JOB.13.18	I know that I shall be vindicated.
JOB.13.19	Who is there that will contend with me?
JOB.13.19	For then I would be silent and die.
JOB.13.20	Only grant two things to me,
JOB.13.20	then I will not hide myself from thy face:
JOB.13.21	withdraw thy hand far from me,
JOB.13.21	and let not dread of thee terrify me.
JOB.13.22	Then call, and I will answer;
JOB.13.22	or let me speak, and do thou reply to me.
JOB.13.23	How many are my iniquities and my sins?
JOB.13.23	Make me know my transgression and my sin.
JOB.13.24	Why dost thou hide thy face,
JOB.13.24	and count me as thy enemy?
JOB.13.25	Wilt thou frighten a driven leaf
JOB.13.25	and pursue dry chaff?
JOB.13.26	For thou writest bitter things against me,
JOB.13.26	and makest me inherit the iniquities of my youth.
JOB.13.27	Thou puttest my feet in the stocks,
JOB.13.27	and watchest all my paths;
JOB.13.27	thou settest a bound to the soles of my feet.
JOB.13.28	Man
JOB.13.28	like a garment that is moth-eaten.
JOB.14.1	“Man that is born of a woman
JOB.14.1	is of few days, and full of trouble.
JOB.14.2	He comes forth like a flower, and withers;
JOB.14.2	he flees like a shadow, and continues not.
JOB.14.3	And dost thou open thy eyes upon such a one
JOB.14.3	and bring him
JOB.14.4	Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?
JOB.14.4	There is not one.
JOB.14.5	Since his days are determined,
JOB.14.5	and the number of his months is with thee,
JOB.14.5	and thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass,
JOB.14.6	look away from him, and desist,
JOB.14.6	that he may enjoy, like a hireling, his day.
JOB.14.7	“For there is hope for a tree,
JOB.14.7	if it be cut down, that it will sprout again,
JOB.14.7	and that its shoots will not cease.
JOB.14.8	Though its root grow old in the earth,
JOB.14.8	and its stump die in the ground,
JOB.14.9	yet at the scent of water it will bud
JOB.14.9	and put forth branches like a young plant.
JOB.14.10	But man dies, and is laid low;
JOB.14.10	man breathes his last, and where is he?
JOB.14.11	As waters fail from a lake,
JOB.14.11	and a river wastes away and dries up,
JOB.14.12	so man lies down and rises not again;
JOB.14.12	till the heavens are no more he will not awake,
JOB.14.12	or be roused out of his sleep.
JOB.14.13	Oh that thou wouldest hide me in Sheol,
JOB.14.13	that thou wouldest conceal me until thy wrath be past,
JOB.14.13	that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!
JOB.14.14	If a man die, shall he live again?
JOB.14.14	All the days of my service I would wait,
JOB.14.14	till my release should come.
JOB.14.15	Thou wouldest call, and I would answer thee;
JOB.14.15	thou wouldest long for the work of thy hands.
JOB.14.16	For then thou wouldest number my steps,
JOB.14.16	thou wouldest not keep watch over my sin;
JOB.14.17	my transgression would be sealed up in a bag,
JOB.14.17	and thou wouldest cover over my iniquity.
JOB.14.18	“But the mountain falls and crumbles away,
JOB.14.18	and the rock is removed from its place;
JOB.14.19	the waters wear away the stones;
JOB.14.19	the torrents wash away the soil of the earth;
JOB.14.19	so thou destroyest the hope of man.
JOB.14.20	Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passes;
JOB.14.20	thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.
JOB.14.21	His sons come to honor, and he does not know it;
JOB.14.21	they are brought low, and he perceives it not.
JOB.14.22	He feels only the pain of his own body,
JOB.14.22	and he mourns only for himself.”
JOB.15.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:
JOB.15.2	“Should a wise man answer with windy knowledge,
JOB.15.2	and fill himself with the east wind?
JOB.15.3	Should he argue in unprofitable talk,
JOB.15.3	or in words with which he can do no good?
JOB.15.4	But you are doing away with the fear of God,
JOB.15.4	and hindering meditation before God.
JOB.15.5	For your iniquity teaches your mouth,
JOB.15.5	and you choose the tongue of the crafty.
JOB.15.6	Your own mouth condemns you, and not I;
JOB.15.6	your own lips testify against you.
JOB.15.7	“Are you the first man that was born?
JOB.15.7	Or were you brought forth before the hills?
JOB.15.8	Have you listened in the council of God?
JOB.15.8	And do you limit wisdom to yourself?
JOB.15.9	What do you know that we do not know?
JOB.15.9	What do you understand that is not clear to us?
JOB.15.10	Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us,
JOB.15.10	older than your father.
JOB.15.11	Are the consolations of God too small for you,
JOB.15.11	or the word that deals gently with you?
JOB.15.12	Why does your heart carry you away,
JOB.15.12	and why do your eyes flash,
JOB.15.13	that you turn your spirit against God,
JOB.15.13	and let such words go out of your mouth?
JOB.15.14	What is man, that he can be clean?
JOB.15.14	Or he that is born of a woman, that he can be righteous?
JOB.15.15	Behold, God puts no trust in his holy ones,
JOB.15.15	and the heavens are not clean in his sight;
JOB.15.16	how much less one who is abominable and corrupt,
JOB.15.16	a man who drinks iniquity like water!
JOB.15.17	“I will show you, hear me;
JOB.15.17	and what I have seen I will declare
JOB.15.18	(what wise men have told,
JOB.15.18	and their fathers have not hidden,
JOB.15.19	to whom alone the land was given,
JOB.15.19	and no stranger passed among them).
JOB.15.20	The wicked man writhes in pain all his days,
JOB.15.20	through all the years that are laid up for the ruthless.
JOB.15.21	Terrifying sounds are in his ears;
JOB.15.21	in prosperity the destroyer will come upon him.
JOB.15.22	He does not believe that he will return out of darkness,
JOB.15.22	and he is destined for the sword.
JOB.15.23	He wanders abroad for bread, saying, ‘Where is it?’
JOB.15.23	He knows that a day of darkness is ready at his hand;
JOB.15.24	distress and anguish terrify him;
JOB.15.24	they prevail against him, like a king prepared for battle.
JOB.15.25	Because he has stretched forth his hand against God,
JOB.15.25	and bids defiance to the Almighty,
JOB.15.26	running stubbornly against him
JOB.15.26	with a thick-bossed shield;
JOB.15.27	because he has covered his face with his fat,
JOB.15.27	and gathered fat upon his loins,
JOB.15.28	and has lived in desolate cities,
JOB.15.28	in houses which no man should inhabit,
JOB.15.28	which were destined to become heaps of ruins;
JOB.15.29	he will not be rich, and his wealth will not endure,
JOB.15.29	nor will he strike root in the earth;
JOB.15.30	he will not escape from darkness;
JOB.15.30	the flame will dry up his shoots,
JOB.15.30	and his blossom
JOB.15.31	Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself;
JOB.15.31	for emptiness will be his recompense.
JOB.15.32	It will be paid in full before his time,
JOB.15.32	and his branch will not be green.
JOB.15.33	He will shake off his unripe grape, like the vine,
JOB.15.33	and cast off his blossom, like the olive tree.
JOB.15.34	For the company of the godless is barren,
JOB.15.34	and fire consumes the tents of bribery.
JOB.15.35	They conceive mischief and bring forth evil
JOB.15.35	and their heart prepares deceit.”
JOB.16.1	Then Job answered:
JOB.16.2	“I have heard many such things;
JOB.16.2	miserable comforters are you all.
JOB.16.3	Shall windy words have an end?
JOB.16.3	Or what provokes you that you answer?
JOB.16.4	I also could speak as you do,
JOB.16.4	if you were in my place;
JOB.16.4	I could join words together against you,
JOB.16.4	and shake my head at you.
JOB.16.5	I could strengthen you with my mouth,
JOB.16.5	and the solace of my lips would assuage your pain.
JOB.16.6	“If I speak, my pain is not assuaged,
JOB.16.6	and if I forbear, how much of it leaves me?
JOB.16.7	Surely now God has worn me out;
JOB.16.7	he has
JOB.16.8	And he has
JOB.16.8	which is a witness against me;
JOB.16.8	and my leanness has risen up against me,
JOB.16.8	it testifies to my face.
JOB.16.9	He has torn me in his wrath, and hated me;
JOB.16.9	he has gnashed his teeth at me;
JOB.16.9	my adversary sharpens his eyes against me.
JOB.16.10	Men have gaped at me with their mouth,
JOB.16.10	they have struck me insolently upon the cheek,
JOB.16.10	they mass themselves together against me.
JOB.16.11	God gives me up to the ungodly,
JOB.16.11	and casts me into the hands of the wicked.
JOB.16.12	I was at ease, and he broke me asunder;
JOB.16.12	he seized me by the neck and dashed me to pieces;
JOB.16.12	he set me up as his target,
JOB.16.13	his archers surround me.
JOB.16.13	He slashes open my kidneys, and does not spare;
JOB.16.13	he pours out my gall on the ground.
JOB.16.14	He breaks me with breach upon breach;
JOB.16.14	he runs upon me like a warrior.
JOB.16.15	I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin,
JOB.16.15	and have laid my strength in the dust.
JOB.16.16	My face is red with weeping,
JOB.16.16	and on my eyelids is deep darkness;
JOB.16.17	although there is no violence in my hands,
JOB.16.17	and my prayer is pure.
JOB.16.18	“O earth, cover not my blood,
JOB.16.18	and let my cry find no resting place.
JOB.16.19	Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven,
JOB.16.19	and he that vouches for me is on high.
JOB.16.20	My friends scorn me;
JOB.16.20	my eye pours out tears to God,
JOB.16.21	that he would maintain the right of a man with God,
JOB.16.21	like
JOB.16.22	For when a few years have come
JOB.16.22	I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
JOB.17.1	My spirit is broken, my days are extinct,
JOB.17.1	the grave is ready for me.
JOB.17.2	Surely there are mockers about me,
JOB.17.2	and my eye dwells on their provocation.
JOB.17.3	“Lay down a pledge for me with thyself;
JOB.17.3	who is there that will give surety for me?
JOB.17.4	Since thou hast closed their minds to understanding,
JOB.17.4	therefore thou wilt not let them triumph.
JOB.17.5	He who informs against his friends to get a share of their property,
JOB.17.5	the eyes of his children will fail.
JOB.17.6	“He has made me a byword of the peoples,
JOB.17.6	and I am one before whom men spit.
JOB.17.7	My eye has grown dim from grief,
JOB.17.7	and all my members are like a shadow.
JOB.17.8	Upright men are appalled at this,
JOB.17.8	and the innocent stirs himself up against the godless.
JOB.17.9	Yet the righteous holds to his way,
JOB.17.9	and he that has clean hands grows stronger and stronger.
JOB.17.10	But you, come on again, all of you,
JOB.17.10	and I shall not find a wise man among you.
JOB.17.11	My days are past, my plans are broken off,
JOB.17.11	the desires of my heart.
JOB.17.12	They make night into day;
JOB.17.12	‘The light,’ they say, ‘is near to the darkness.’
JOB.17.13	If I look for Sheol as my house,
JOB.17.13	if I spread my couch in darkness,
JOB.17.14	if I say to the pit, ‘You are my father,’
JOB.17.14	and to the worm, ‘My mother,’ or ‘My sister,’
JOB.17.15	where then is my hope?
JOB.17.15	Who will see my hope?
JOB.17.16	Will it go down to the bars of Sheol?
JOB.17.16	Shall we descend together into the dust?”
JOB.18.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite answered:
JOB.18.2	“How long will you hunt for words?
JOB.18.2	Consider, and then we will speak.
JOB.18.3	Why are we counted as cattle?
JOB.18.3	Why are we stupid in your sight?
JOB.18.4	You who tear yourself in your anger,
JOB.18.4	shall the earth be forsaken for you,
JOB.18.4	or the rock be removed out of its place?
JOB.18.5	“Yea, the light of the wicked is put out,
JOB.18.5	and the flame of his fire does not shine.
JOB.18.6	The light is dark in his tent,
JOB.18.6	and his lamp above him is put out.
JOB.18.7	His strong steps are shortened
JOB.18.7	and his own schemes throw him down.
JOB.18.8	For he is cast into a net by his own feet,
JOB.18.8	and he walks on a pitfall.
JOB.18.9	A trap seizes him by the heel,
JOB.18.9	a snare lays hold of him.
JOB.18.10	A rope is hid for him in the ground,
JOB.18.10	a trap for him in the path.
JOB.18.11	Terrors frighten him on every side,
JOB.18.11	and chase him at his heels.
JOB.18.12	His strength is hunger-bitten,
JOB.18.12	and calamity is ready for his stumbling.
JOB.18.13	By disease his skin is consumed,
JOB.18.13	the first-born of death consumes his limbs.
JOB.18.14	He is torn from the tent in which he trusted,
JOB.18.14	and is brought to the king of terrors.
JOB.18.15	In his tent dwells that which is none of his;
JOB.18.15	brimstone is scattered upon his habitation.
JOB.18.16	His roots dry up beneath,
JOB.18.16	and his branches wither above.
JOB.18.17	His memory perishes from the earth,
JOB.18.17	and he has no name in the street.
JOB.18.18	He is thrust from light into darkness,
JOB.18.18	and driven out of the world.
JOB.18.19	He has no offspring or descendant among his people,
JOB.18.19	and no survivor where he used to live.
JOB.18.20	They of the west are appalled at his day,
JOB.18.20	and horror seizes them of the east.
JOB.18.21	Surely such are the dwellings of the ungodly,
JOB.18.21	such is the place of him who knows not God.”
JOB.19.1	Then Job answered:
JOB.19.2	“How long will you torment me,
JOB.19.2	and break me in pieces with words?
JOB.19.3	These ten times you have cast reproach upon me;
JOB.19.3	are you not ashamed to wrong me?
JOB.19.4	And even if it be true that I have erred,
JOB.19.4	my error remains with myself.
JOB.19.5	If indeed you magnify yourselves against me,
JOB.19.5	and make my humiliation an argument against me,
JOB.19.6	know then that God has put me in the wrong,
JOB.19.6	and closed his net about me.
JOB.19.7	Behold, I cry out, ‘Violence!’ but I am not answered;
JOB.19.7	I call aloud, but there is no justice.
JOB.19.8	He has walled up my way, so that I cannot pass,
JOB.19.8	and he has set darkness upon my paths.
JOB.19.9	He has stripped from me my glory,
JOB.19.9	and taken the crown from my head.
JOB.19.10	He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone,
JOB.19.10	and my hope has he pulled up like a tree.
JOB.19.11	He has kindled his wrath against me,
JOB.19.11	and counts me as his adversary.
JOB.19.12	His troops come on together;
JOB.19.12	they have cast up siegeworks
JOB.19.12	and encamp round about my tent.
JOB.19.13	“He has put my brethren far from me,
JOB.19.13	and my acquaintances are wholly estranged from me.
JOB.19.14	My kinsfolk and my close friends have failed me;
JOB.19.15	the guests in my house have forgotten me;
JOB.19.15	my maidservants count me as a stranger;
JOB.19.15	I have become an alien in their eyes.
JOB.19.16	I call to my servant, but he gives me no answer;
JOB.19.16	I must beseech him with my mouth.
JOB.19.17	I am repulsive to my wife,
JOB.19.17	loathsome to the sons of my own mother.
JOB.19.18	Even young children despise me;
JOB.19.18	when I rise they talk against me.
JOB.19.19	All my intimate friends abhor me,
JOB.19.19	and those whom I loved have turned against me.
JOB.19.20	My bones cleave to my skin and to my flesh,
JOB.19.20	and I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.
JOB.19.21	Have pity on me, have pity on me, O you my friends,
JOB.19.21	for the hand of God has touched me!
JOB.19.22	Why do you, like God, pursue me?
JOB.19.22	Why are you not satisfied with my flesh?
JOB.19.23	“Oh that my words were written!
JOB.19.23	Oh that they were inscribed in a book!
JOB.19.24	Oh that with an iron pen and lead
JOB.19.24	they were graven in the rock for ever!
JOB.19.25	For I know that my Redeemer
JOB.19.25	and at last he will stand upon the earth;
JOB.19.26	and after my skin has been thus destroyed,
JOB.19.26	then from
JOB.19.27	whom I shall see on my side,
JOB.19.27	and my eyes shall behold, and not another.
JOB.19.27	My heart faints within me!
JOB.19.28	If you say, ‘How we will pursue him!’
JOB.19.28	and, ‘The root of the matter is found in him’;
JOB.19.29	be afraid of the sword,
JOB.19.29	for wrath brings the punishment of the sword,
JOB.19.29	that you may know there is a judgment.”
JOB.20.1	Then Zophar the Naamathite answered:
JOB.20.2	“Therefore my thoughts answer me,
JOB.20.2	because of my haste within me.
JOB.20.3	I hear censure which insults me,
JOB.20.3	and out of my understanding a spirit answers me.
JOB.20.4	Do you not know this from of old,
JOB.20.4	since man was placed upon earth,
JOB.20.5	that the exulting of the wicked is short,
JOB.20.5	and the joy of the godless but for a moment?
JOB.20.6	Though his height mount up to the heavens,
JOB.20.6	and his head reach to the clouds,
JOB.20.7	he will perish for ever like his own dung;
JOB.20.7	those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’
JOB.20.8	He will fly away like a dream, and not be found;
JOB.20.8	he will be chased away like a vision of the night.
JOB.20.9	The eye which saw him will see him no more,
JOB.20.9	nor will his place any more behold him.
JOB.20.10	His children will seek the favor of the poor,
JOB.20.10	and his hands will give back his wealth.
JOB.20.11	His bones are full of youthful vigor,
JOB.20.11	but it will lie down with him in the dust.
JOB.20.12	“Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth,
JOB.20.12	though he hides it under his tongue,
JOB.20.13	though he is loath to let it go,
JOB.20.13	and holds it in his mouth,
JOB.20.14	yet his food is turned in his stomach;
JOB.20.14	it is the gall of asps within him.
JOB.20.15	He swallows down riches and vomits them up again;
JOB.20.15	God casts them out of his belly.
JOB.20.16	He will suck the poison of asps;
JOB.20.16	the tongue of a viper will kill him.
JOB.20.17	He will not look upon the rivers,
JOB.20.17	the streams flowing with honey and curds.
JOB.20.18	He will give back the fruit of his toil,
JOB.20.18	and will not swallow it down;
JOB.20.18	from the profit of his trading
JOB.20.18	he will get no enjoyment.
JOB.20.19	For he has crushed and abandoned the poor,
JOB.20.19	he has seized a house which he did not build.
JOB.20.20	“Because his greed knew no rest,
JOB.20.20	he will not save anything in which he delights.
JOB.20.21	There was nothing left after he had eaten;
JOB.20.21	therefore his prosperity will not endure.
JOB.20.22	In the fulness of his sufficiency he will be in straits;
JOB.20.22	all the force of misery will come upon him.
JOB.20.23	To fill his belly to the full
JOB.20.23	God
JOB.20.23	and rain it upon him as his food.
JOB.20.24	He will flee from an iron weapon;
JOB.20.24	a bronze arrow will strike him through.
JOB.20.25	It is drawn forth and comes out of his body,
JOB.20.25	the glittering point comes out of his gall;
JOB.20.25	terrors come upon him.
JOB.20.26	Utter darkness is laid up for his treasures;
JOB.20.26	a fire not blown upon will devour him;
JOB.20.26	what is left in his tent will be consumed.
JOB.20.27	The heavens will reveal his iniquity,
JOB.20.27	and the earth will rise up against him.
JOB.20.28	The possessions of his house will be carried away,
JOB.20.28	dragged off in the day of God's
JOB.20.29	This is the wicked man's portion from God,
JOB.20.29	the heritage decreed for him by God.”
JOB.21.1	Then Job answered:
JOB.21.2	“Listen carefully to my words,
JOB.21.2	and let this be your consolation.
JOB.21.3	Bear with me, and I will speak,
JOB.21.3	and after I have spoken, mock on.
JOB.21.4	As for me, is my complaint against man?
JOB.21.4	Why should I not be impatient?
JOB.21.5	Look at me, and be appalled,
JOB.21.5	and lay your hand upon your mouth.
JOB.21.6	When I think of it I am dismayed,
JOB.21.6	and shuddering seizes my flesh.
JOB.21.7	Why do the wicked live,
JOB.21.7	reach old age, and grow mighty in power?
JOB.21.8	Their children are established in their presence,
JOB.21.8	and their offspring before their eyes.
JOB.21.9	Their houses are safe from fear,
JOB.21.9	and no rod of God is upon them.
JOB.21.10	Their bull breeds without fail;
JOB.21.10	their cow calves, and does not cast her calf.
JOB.21.11	They send forth their little ones like a flock,
JOB.21.11	and their children dance.
JOB.21.12	They sing to the tambourine and the lyre,
JOB.21.12	and rejoice to the sound of the pipe.
JOB.21.13	They spend their days in prosperity,
JOB.21.13	and in peace they go down to Sheol.
JOB.21.14	They say to God, ‘Depart from us!
JOB.21.14	We do not desire the knowledge of thy ways.
JOB.21.15	What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?
JOB.21.15	And what profit do we get if we pray to him?’
JOB.21.16	Behold, is not their prosperity in their hand?
JOB.21.16	The counsel of the wicked is far from me.
JOB.21.17	“How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out?
JOB.21.17	That their calamity comes upon them?
JOB.21.17	That God
JOB.21.18	That they are like straw before the wind,
JOB.21.18	and like chaff that the storm carries away?
JOB.21.19	You say, ‘God stores up their iniquity for their sons.’
JOB.21.19	Let him recompense it to themselves, that they may know it.
JOB.21.20	Let their own eyes see their destruction,
JOB.21.20	and let them drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
JOB.21.21	For what do they care for their houses after them,
JOB.21.21	when the number of their months is cut off?
JOB.21.22	Will any teach God knowledge,
JOB.21.22	seeing that he judges those that are on high?
JOB.21.23	One dies in full prosperity,
JOB.21.23	being wholly at ease and secure,
JOB.21.24	his body
JOB.21.24	and the marrow of his bones moist.
JOB.21.25	Another dies in bitterness of soul,
JOB.21.25	never having tasted of good.
JOB.21.26	They lie down alike in the dust,
JOB.21.26	and the worms cover them.
JOB.21.27	“Behold, I know your thoughts,
JOB.21.27	and your schemes to wrong me.
JOB.21.28	For you say, ‘Where is the house of the prince?
JOB.21.28	Where is the tent in which the wicked dwelt?’
JOB.21.29	Have you not asked those who travel the roads,
JOB.21.29	and do you not accept their testimony
JOB.21.30	that the wicked man is spared in the day of calamity,
JOB.21.30	that he is rescued in the day of wrath?
JOB.21.31	Who declares his way to his face,
JOB.21.31	and who requites him for what he has done?
JOB.21.32	When he is borne to the grave,
JOB.21.32	watch is kept over his tomb.
JOB.21.33	The clods of the valley are sweet to him;
JOB.21.33	all men follow after him,
JOB.21.33	and those who go before him are innumerable.
JOB.21.34	How then will you comfort me with empty nothings?
JOB.21.34	There is nothing left of your answers but falsehood.”
JOB.22.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:
JOB.22.2	Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself.
JOB.22.3	Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are righteous,
JOB.22.3	or is it gain to him if you make your ways blameless?
JOB.22.4	Is it for your fear of him that he reproves you,
JOB.22.4	and enters into judgment with you?
JOB.22.5	Is not your wickedness great?
JOB.22.5	There is no end to your iniquities.
JOB.22.6	For you have exacted pledges of your brothers for nothing,
JOB.22.6	and stripped the naked of their clothing.
JOB.22.7	You have given no water to the weary to drink,
JOB.22.7	and you have withheld bread from the hungry.
JOB.22.8	The man with power possessed the land,
JOB.22.8	and the favored man dwelt in it.
JOB.22.9	You have sent widows away empty,
JOB.22.9	and the arms of the fatherless were crushed.
JOB.22.10	Therefore snares are round about you,
JOB.22.10	and sudden terror overwhelms you;
JOB.22.11	your light is darkened, so that
JOB.22.11	and a flood of water covers you.
JOB.22.12	“Is not God high in the heavens?
JOB.22.12	See the highest stars, how lofty they are!
JOB.22.13	Therefore you say, ‘What does God know?
JOB.22.13	Can he judge through the deep darkness?
JOB.22.14	Thick clouds enwrap him, so that he does not see,
JOB.22.14	and he walks on the vault of heaven.’
JOB.22.15	Will you keep to the old way
JOB.22.15	which wicked men have trod?
JOB.22.16	They were snatched away before their time;
JOB.22.16	their foundation was washed away.
JOB.22.17	They said to God, ‘Depart from us,’
JOB.22.17	and ‘What can the Almighty do to us?’
JOB.22.18	Yet he filled their houses with good things—
JOB.22.18	but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
JOB.22.19	The righteous see it and are glad;
JOB.22.19	the innocent laugh them to scorn,
JOB.22.20	saying, ‘Surely our adversaries are cut off,
JOB.22.20	and what they left the fire has consumed.’
JOB.22.21	“Agree with God, and be at peace;
JOB.22.21	thereby good will come to you.
JOB.22.22	Receive instruction from his mouth,
JOB.22.22	and lay up his words in your heart.
JOB.22.23	If you return to the Almighty and humble yourself,
JOB.22.23	if you remove unrighteousness far from your tents,
JOB.22.24	if you lay gold in the dust,
JOB.22.24	and gold of Ophir among the stones of the torrent bed,
JOB.22.25	and if the Almighty is your gold,
JOB.22.25	and your precious silver;
JOB.22.26	then you will delight yourself in the Almighty,
JOB.22.26	and lift up your face to God.
JOB.22.27	You will make your prayer to him, and he will hear you;
JOB.22.27	and you will pay your vows.
JOB.22.28	You will decide on a matter, and it will be established for you,
JOB.22.28	and light will shine on your ways.
JOB.22.29	For God abases the proud,
JOB.22.29	but he saves the lowly.
JOB.22.30	He delivers the innocent man;
JOB.22.30	you will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.”
JOB.23.1	Then Job answered:
JOB.23.2	“Today also my complaint is bitter,
JOB.23.2	his
JOB.23.3	Oh, that I knew where I might find him,
JOB.23.3	that I might come even to his seat!
JOB.23.4	I would lay my case before him
JOB.23.4	and fill my mouth with arguments.
JOB.23.5	I would learn what he would answer me,
JOB.23.5	and understand what he would say to me.
JOB.23.6	Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power?
JOB.23.6	No; he would give heed to me.
JOB.23.7	There an upright man could reason with him,
JOB.23.7	and I should be acquitted for ever by my judge.
JOB.23.8	“Behold, I go forward, but he is not there;
JOB.23.8	and backward, but I cannot perceive him;
JOB.23.9	on the left hand I seek him,
JOB.23.9	I
JOB.23.10	But he knows the way that I take;
JOB.23.10	when he has tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
JOB.23.11	My foot has held fast to his steps;
JOB.23.11	I have kept his way and have not turned aside.
JOB.23.12	I have not departed from the commandment of his lips;
JOB.23.12	I have treasured in
JOB.23.13	But he is unchangeable and who can turn him?
JOB.23.13	What he desires, that he does.
JOB.23.14	For he will complete what he appoints for me;
JOB.23.14	and many such things are in his mind.
JOB.23.15	Therefore I am terrified at his presence;
JOB.23.15	when I consider, I am in dread of him.
JOB.23.16	God has made my heart faint;
JOB.23.16	the Almighty has terrified me;
JOB.23.17	for I am
JOB.23.17	and thick darkness covers my face.
JOB.24.1	“Why are not times of judgment kept by the Almighty,
JOB.24.1	and why do those who know him never see his days?
JOB.24.2	Men remove landmarks;
JOB.24.2	they seize flocks and pasture them.
JOB.24.3	They drive away the ass of the fatherless;
JOB.24.3	they take the widow's ox for a pledge.
JOB.24.4	They thrust the poor off the road;
JOB.24.4	the poor of the earth all hide themselves.
JOB.24.5	Behold, like wild asses in the desert
JOB.24.5	they go forth to their toil,
JOB.24.5	seeking prey in the wilderness
JOB.24.5	as food
JOB.24.6	They gather their
JOB.24.6	and they glean the vineyard of the wicked man.
JOB.24.7	They lie all night naked, without clothing,
JOB.24.7	and have no covering in the cold.
JOB.24.8	They are wet with the rain of the mountains,
JOB.24.8	and cling to the rock for want of shelter.
JOB.24.9	(There are those who snatch the fatherless child from the breast,
JOB.24.9	and take in pledge the infant of the poor.)
JOB.24.10	They go about naked, without clothing;
JOB.24.10	hungry, they carry the sheaves;
JOB.24.11	among the olive rows of the wicked
JOB.24.11	they tread the wine presses, but suffer thirst.
JOB.24.12	From out of the city the dying groan,
JOB.24.12	and the soul of the wounded cries for help;
JOB.24.12	yet God pays no attention to their prayer.
JOB.24.13	“There are those who rebel against the light,
JOB.24.13	who are not acquainted with its ways,
JOB.24.13	and do not stay in its paths.
JOB.24.14	The murderer rises in the dark,
JOB.24.14	that he may kill the poor and needy;
JOB.24.14	and in the night he is as a thief.
JOB.24.15	The eye of the adulterer also waits for the twilight,
JOB.24.15	saying, ‘No eye will see me’;
JOB.24.15	and he disguises his face.
JOB.24.16	In the dark they dig through houses;
JOB.24.16	by day they shut themselves up;
JOB.24.16	they do not know the light.
JOB.24.17	For deep darkness is morning to all of them;
JOB.24.17	for they are friends with the terrors of deep darkness.
JOB.24.18	“You say, ‘They are swiftly carried away upon the face of the waters;
JOB.24.18	their portion is cursed in the land;
JOB.24.18	no treader turns toward their vineyards.
JOB.24.19	Drought and heat snatch away the snow waters;
JOB.24.19	so does Sheol those who have sinned.
JOB.24.20	The squares of the town
JOB.24.20	their name
JOB.24.20	so wickedness is broken like a tree.’
JOB.24.21	“They feed on the barren childless woman,
JOB.24.21	and do no good to the widow.
JOB.24.22	Yet God
JOB.24.22	they rise up when they despair of life.
JOB.24.23	He gives them security, and they are supported;
JOB.24.23	and his eyes are upon their ways.
JOB.24.24	They are exalted a little while, and then are gone;
JOB.24.24	they wither and fade like the mallow;
JOB.24.24	they are cut off like the heads of grain.
JOB.24.25	If it is not so, who will prove me a liar,
JOB.24.25	and show that there is nothing in what I say?”
JOB.25.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite answered:
JOB.25.2	“Dominion and fear are with God;
JOB.25.2	he makes peace in his high heaven.
JOB.25.3	Is there any number to his armies?
JOB.25.3	Upon whom does his light not arise?
JOB.25.4	How then can man be righteous before God?
JOB.25.4	How can he who is born of woman be clean?
JOB.25.5	Behold, even the moon is not bright
JOB.25.5	and the stars are not clean in his sight;
JOB.25.6	how much less man, who is a maggot,
JOB.25.6	and the son of man, who is a worm!”
JOB.26.1	Then Job answered:
JOB.26.2	“How you have helped him who has no power!
JOB.26.2	How you have saved the arm that has no strength!
JOB.26.3	How you have counseled him who has no wisdom,
JOB.26.3	and plentifully declared sound knowledge!
JOB.26.4	With whose help have you uttered words,
JOB.26.4	and whose spirit has come forth from you?
JOB.26.5	The shades below tremble,
JOB.26.5	the waters and their inhabitants.
JOB.26.6	Sheol is naked before God,
JOB.26.6	and Abaddon has no covering.
JOB.26.7	He stretches out the north over the void,
JOB.26.7	and hangs the earth upon nothing.
JOB.26.8	He binds up the waters in his thick clouds,
JOB.26.8	and the cloud is not rent under them.
JOB.26.9	He covers the face of the moon,
JOB.26.9	and spreads over it his cloud.
JOB.26.10	He has described a circle upon the face of the waters
JOB.26.10	at the boundary between light and darkness.
JOB.26.11	The pillars of heaven tremble,
JOB.26.11	and are astounded at his rebuke.
JOB.26.12	By his power he stilled the sea;
JOB.26.12	by his understanding he smote Rahab.
JOB.26.13	By his wind the heavens were made fair;
JOB.26.13	his hand pierced the fleeing serpent.
JOB.26.14	Lo, these are but the outskirts of his ways;
JOB.26.14	and how small a whisper do we hear of him!
JOB.26.14	But the thunder of his power who can understand?”
JOB.27.1	And Job again took up his discourse, and said:
JOB.27.2	“As God lives, who has taken away my right,
JOB.27.2	and the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter;
JOB.27.3	as long as my breath is in me,
JOB.27.3	and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;
JOB.27.4	my lips will not speak falsehood,
JOB.27.4	and my tongue will not utter deceit.
JOB.27.5	Far be it from me to say that you are right;
JOB.27.5	till I die I will not put away my integrity from me.
JOB.27.6	I hold fast my righteousness, and will not let it go;
JOB.27.6	my heart does not reproach me for any of my days.
JOB.27.7	“Let my enemy be as the wicked,
JOB.27.7	and let him that rises up against me be as the unrighteous.
JOB.27.8	For what is the hope of the godless when God cuts him off,
JOB.27.8	when God takes away his life?
JOB.27.9	Will God hear his cry,
JOB.27.9	when trouble comes upon him?
JOB.27.10	Will he take delight in the Almighty?
JOB.27.10	Will he call upon God at all times?
JOB.27.11	I will teach you concerning the hand of God;
JOB.27.11	what is with the Almighty I will not conceal.
JOB.27.12	Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves;
JOB.27.12	why then have you become altogether vain?
JOB.27.13	“This is the portion of a wicked man with God,
JOB.27.13	and the heritage which oppressors receive from the Almighty:
JOB.27.14	If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword;
JOB.27.14	and his offspring have not enough to eat.
JOB.27.15	Those who survive him the pestilence buries,
JOB.27.15	and their widows make no lamentation.
JOB.27.16	Though he heap up silver like dust,
JOB.27.16	and pile up clothing like clay;
JOB.27.17	he may pile it up, but the just will wear it,
JOB.27.17	and the innocent will divide the silver.
JOB.27.18	The house which he builds is like a spider's web,
JOB.27.18	like a booth which a watchman makes.
JOB.27.19	He goes to bed rich, but will do so no more;
JOB.27.19	he opens his eyes, and his wealth is gone.
JOB.27.20	Terrors overtake him like a flood;
JOB.27.20	in the night a whirlwind carries him off.
JOB.27.21	The east wind lifts him up and he is gone;
JOB.27.21	it sweeps him out of his place.
JOB.27.22	It
JOB.27.22	he flees from its
JOB.27.23	It
JOB.27.23	and hisses at him from its
JOB.28.1	“Surely there is a mine for silver,
JOB.28.1	and a place for gold which they refine.
JOB.28.2	Iron is taken out of the earth,
JOB.28.2	and copper is smelted from the ore.
JOB.28.3	Men put an end to darkness,
JOB.28.3	and search out to the farthest bound
JOB.28.3	the ore in gloom and deep darkness.
JOB.28.4	They open shafts in a valley away from where men live;
JOB.28.4	they are forgotten by travelers,
JOB.28.4	they hang afar from men, they swing to and fro.
JOB.28.5	As for the earth, out of it comes bread;
JOB.28.5	but underneath it is turned up as by fire.
JOB.28.6	Its stones are the place of sapphires,
JOB.28.6	and it has dust of gold.
JOB.28.7	“That path no bird of prey knows,
JOB.28.7	and the falcon's eye has not seen it.
JOB.28.8	The proud beasts have not trodden it;
JOB.28.8	the lion has not passed over it.
JOB.28.9	“Man puts his hand to the flinty rock,
JOB.28.9	and overturns mountains by the roots.
JOB.28.10	He cuts out channels in the rocks,
JOB.28.10	and his eye sees every precious thing.
JOB.28.11	He binds up the streams so that they do not trickle,
JOB.28.11	and the thing that is hid he brings forth to light.
JOB.28.12	“But where shall wisdom be found?
JOB.28.12	And where is the place of understanding?
JOB.28.13	Man does not know the way to it,
JOB.28.13	and it is not found in the land of the living.
JOB.28.14	The deep says, ‘It is not in me,’
JOB.28.14	and the sea says, ‘It is not with me.’
JOB.28.15	It cannot be gotten for gold,
JOB.28.15	and silver cannot be weighed as its price.
JOB.28.16	It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir,
JOB.28.16	in precious onyx or sapphire.
JOB.28.17	Gold and glass cannot equal it,
JOB.28.17	nor can it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.
JOB.28.18	No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal;
JOB.28.18	the price of wisdom is above pearls.
JOB.28.19	The topaz of Ethiopia cannot compare with it,
JOB.28.19	nor can it be valued in pure gold.
JOB.28.20	“Whence then comes wisdom?
JOB.28.20	And where is the place of understanding?
JOB.28.21	It is hid from the eyes of all living,
JOB.28.21	and concealed from the birds of the air.
JOB.28.22	Abaddon and Death say,
JOB.28.22	‘We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.’
JOB.28.23	“God understands the way to it,
JOB.28.23	and he knows its place.
JOB.28.24	For he looks to the ends of the earth,
JOB.28.24	and sees everything under the heavens.
JOB.28.25	When he gave to the wind its weight,
JOB.28.25	and meted out the waters by measure;
JOB.28.26	when he made a decree for the rain,
JOB.28.26	and a way for the lightning of the thunder;
JOB.28.27	then he saw it and declared it;
JOB.28.27	he established it, and searched it out.
JOB.28.28	And he said to man,
JOB.28.28	‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom;
JOB.28.28	and to depart from evil is understanding.’ ”
JOB.29.1	And Job again took up his discourse, and said:
JOB.29.2	“Oh, that I were as in the months of old,
JOB.29.2	as in the days when God watched over me;
JOB.29.3	when his lamp shone upon my head,
JOB.29.3	and by his light I walked through darkness;
JOB.29.4	as I was in my autumn days,
JOB.29.4	when the friendship of God was upon my tent;
JOB.29.5	when the Almighty was yet with me,
JOB.29.5	when my children were about me;
JOB.29.6	when my steps were washed with milk,
JOB.29.6	and the rock poured out for me streams of oil!
JOB.29.7	When I went out to the gate of the city,
JOB.29.7	when I prepared my seat in the square,
JOB.29.8	the young men saw me and withdrew,
JOB.29.8	and the aged rose and stood;
JOB.29.9	the princes refrained from talking,
JOB.29.9	and laid their hand on their mouth;
JOB.29.10	the voice of the nobles was hushed,
JOB.29.10	and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
JOB.29.11	When the ear heard, it called me blessed,
JOB.29.11	and when the eye saw, it approved;
JOB.29.12	because I delivered the poor who cried,
JOB.29.12	and the fatherless who had none to help him.
JOB.29.13	The blessing of him who was about to perish came upon me,
JOB.29.13	and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
JOB.29.14	I put on righteousness, and it clothed me;
JOB.29.14	my justice was like a robe and a turban.
JOB.29.15	I was eyes to the blind,
JOB.29.15	and feet to the lame.
JOB.29.16	I was a father to the poor,
JOB.29.16	and I searched out the cause of him whom I did not know.
JOB.29.17	I broke the fangs of the unrighteous,
JOB.29.17	and made him drop his prey from his teeth.
JOB.29.18	Then I thought, ‘I shall die in my nest,
JOB.29.18	and I shall multiply my days as the sand,
JOB.29.19	my roots spread out to the waters,
JOB.29.19	with the dew all night on my branches,
JOB.29.20	my glory fresh with me,
JOB.29.20	and my bow ever new in my hand.’
JOB.29.21	“Men listened to me, and waited,
JOB.29.21	and kept silence for my counsel.
JOB.29.22	After I spoke they did not speak again,
JOB.29.22	and my word dropped upon them.
JOB.29.23	They waited for me as for the rain;
JOB.29.23	and they opened their mouths as for the spring rain.
JOB.29.24	I smiled on them when they had no confidence;
JOB.29.24	and the light of my countenance they did not cast down.
JOB.29.25	I chose their way, and sat as chief,
JOB.29.25	and I dwelt like a king among his troops,
JOB.29.25	like one who comforts mourners.
JOB.30.1	“But now they make sport of me,
JOB.30.1	men who are younger than I,
JOB.30.1	whose fathers I would have disdained
JOB.30.1	to set with the dogs of my flock.
JOB.30.2	What could I gain from the strength of their hands,
JOB.30.2	men whose vigor is gone?
JOB.30.3	Through want and hard hunger
JOB.30.3	they gnaw the dry and desolate ground;
JOB.30.4	they pick mallow and the leaves of bushes,
JOB.30.4	and to warm themselves the roots of the broom.
JOB.30.5	They are driven out from among men;
JOB.30.5	they shout after them as after a thief.
JOB.30.6	In the gullies of the torrents they must dwell,
JOB.30.6	in holes of the earth and of the rocks.
JOB.30.7	Among the bushes they bray;
JOB.30.7	under the nettles they huddle together.
JOB.30.8	A senseless, a disreputable brood,
JOB.30.8	they have been whipped out of the land.
JOB.30.9	“And now I have become their song,
JOB.30.9	I am a byword to them.
JOB.30.10	They abhor me, they keep aloof from me;
JOB.30.10	they do not hesitate to spit at the sight of me.
JOB.30.11	Because God has loosed my cord and humbled me,
JOB.30.11	they have cast off restraint in my presence.
JOB.30.12	On my right hand the rabble rise,
JOB.30.12	they drive me
JOB.30.12	they cast up against me their ways of destruction.
JOB.30.13	They break up my path,
JOB.30.13	they promote my calamity;
JOB.30.13	no one restrains
JOB.30.14	As through
JOB.30.14	amid the crash they roll on.
JOB.30.15	Terrors are turned upon me;
JOB.30.15	my honor is pursued as by the wind,
JOB.30.15	and my prosperity has passed away like a cloud.
JOB.30.16	“And now my soul is poured out within me;
JOB.30.16	days of affliction have taken hold of me.
JOB.30.17	The night racks my bones,
JOB.30.17	and the pain that gnaws me takes no rest.
JOB.30.18	With violence it seizes my garment;
JOB.30.18	it binds me about like the collar of my tunic.
JOB.30.19	God has cast me into the mire,
JOB.30.19	and I have become like dust and ashes.
JOB.30.20	I cry to thee and thou dost not answer me;
JOB.30.20	I stand, and thou dost not
JOB.30.21	Thou hast turned cruel to me;
JOB.30.21	with the might of thy hand thou dost persecute me.
JOB.30.22	Thou liftest me up on the wind, thou makest me ride on it,
JOB.30.22	and thou tossest me about in the roar of the storm.
JOB.30.23	Yea, I know that thou wilt bring me to death,
JOB.30.23	and to the house appointed for all living.
JOB.30.24	“Yet does not one in a heap of ruins stretch out his hand,
JOB.30.24	and in his disaster cry for help?
JOB.30.25	Did not I weep for him whose day was hard?
JOB.30.25	Was not my soul grieved for the poor?
JOB.30.26	But when I looked for good, evil came;
JOB.30.26	and when I waited for light, darkness came.
JOB.30.27	My heart is in turmoil, and is never still;
JOB.30.27	days of affliction come to meet me.
JOB.30.28	I go about blackened, but not by the sun;
JOB.30.28	I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.
JOB.30.29	I am a brother of jackals,
JOB.30.29	and a companion of ostriches.
JOB.30.30	My skin turns black and falls from me,
JOB.30.30	and my bones burn with heat.
JOB.30.31	My lyre is turned to mourning,
JOB.30.31	and my pipe to the voice of those who weep.
JOB.31.1	“I have made a covenant with my eyes;
JOB.31.1	how then could I look upon a virgin?
JOB.31.2	What would be my portion from God above,
JOB.31.2	and my heritage from the Almighty on high?
JOB.31.3	Does not calamity befall the unrighteous,
JOB.31.3	and disaster the workers of iniquity?
JOB.31.4	Does not he see my ways,
JOB.31.4	and number all my steps?
JOB.31.5	“If I have walked with falsehood,
JOB.31.5	and my foot has hastened to deceit;
JOB.31.6	(Let me be weighed in a just balance,
JOB.31.6	and let God know my integrity!)
JOB.31.7	if my step has turned aside from the way,
JOB.31.7	and my heart has gone after my eyes,
JOB.31.7	and if any spot has cleaved to my hands;
JOB.31.8	then let me sow, and another eat;
JOB.31.8	and let what grows for me be rooted out.
JOB.31.9	“If my heart has been enticed to a woman,
JOB.31.9	and I have lain in wait at my neighbor's door;
JOB.31.10	then let my wife grind for another,
JOB.31.10	and let others bow down upon her.
JOB.31.11	For that would be a heinous crime;
JOB.31.11	that would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges;
JOB.31.12	for that would be a fire which consumes unto Abaddon,
JOB.31.12	and it would burn to the root all my increase.
JOB.31.13	“If I have rejected the cause of my manservant or my maidservant,
JOB.31.13	when they brought a complaint against me;
JOB.31.14	what then shall I do when God rises up?
JOB.31.14	When he makes inquiry, what shall I answer him?
JOB.31.15	Did not he who made me in the womb make him?
JOB.31.15	And did not one fashion us in the womb?
JOB.31.16	“If I have withheld anything that the poor desired,
JOB.31.16	or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,
JOB.31.17	or have eaten my morsel alone,
JOB.31.17	and the fatherless has not eaten of it
JOB.31.18	(for from his youth I reared him as a father,
JOB.31.18	and from his mother's womb I guided him
JOB.31.19	if I have seen any one perish for lack of clothing,
JOB.31.19	or a poor man without covering;
JOB.31.20	if his loins have not blessed me,
JOB.31.20	and if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
JOB.31.21	if I have raised my hand against the fatherless,
JOB.31.21	because I saw help in the gate;
JOB.31.22	then let my shoulder blade fall from my shoulder,
JOB.31.22	and let my arm be broken from its socket.
JOB.31.23	For I was in terror of calamity from God,
JOB.31.23	and I could not have faced his majesty.
JOB.31.24	“If I have made gold my trust,
JOB.31.24	or called fine gold my confidence;
JOB.31.25	if I have rejoiced because my wealth was great,
JOB.31.25	or because my hand had gotten much;
JOB.31.26	if I have looked at the sun
JOB.31.26	or the moon moving in splendor,
JOB.31.27	and my heart has been secretly enticed,
JOB.31.27	and my mouth has kissed my hand;
JOB.31.28	this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges,
JOB.31.28	for I should have been false to God above.
JOB.31.29	“If I have rejoiced at the ruin of him that hated me,
JOB.31.29	or exulted when evil overtook him
JOB.31.30	(I have not let my mouth sin
JOB.31.30	by asking for his life with a curse);
JOB.31.31	if the men of my tent have not said,
JOB.31.31	‘Who is there that has not been filled with his meat?’
JOB.31.32	(the sojourner has not lodged in the street;
JOB.31.32	I have opened my doors to the wayfarer);
JOB.31.33	if I have concealed my transgressions from men,
JOB.31.33	by hiding my iniquity in my bosom,
JOB.31.34	because I stood in great fear of the multitude,
JOB.31.34	and the contempt of families terrified me,
JOB.31.34	so that I kept silence, and did not go out of doors—
JOB.31.35	Oh, that I had one to hear me!
JOB.31.35	(Here is my signature! let the Almighty answer me!)
JOB.31.35	Oh, that I had the indictment written by my adversary!
JOB.31.36	Surely I would carry it on my shoulder;
JOB.31.36	I would bind it on me as a crown;
JOB.31.37	I would give him an account of all my steps;
JOB.31.37	like a prince I would approach him.
JOB.31.38	“If my land has cried out against me,
JOB.31.38	and its furrows have wept together;
JOB.31.39	if I have eaten its yield without payment,
JOB.31.39	and caused the death of its owners;
JOB.31.40	let thorns grow instead of wheat,
JOB.31.40	and foul weeds instead of barley.”
JOB.31.40	The words of Job are ended.
JOB.32.1	So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. 
JOB.32.2	Then Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became angry. He was angry at Job because he justified himself rather than God; 
JOB.32.3	he was angry also at Job's three friends because they had found no answer, although they had declared Job to be in the wrong. 
JOB.32.4	Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were older than he. 
JOB.32.5	And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, he became angry.
JOB.32.6	And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered:
JOB.32.6	“I am young in years,
JOB.32.6	and you are aged;
JOB.32.6	therefore I was timid and afraid
JOB.32.6	to declare my opinion to you.
JOB.32.7	I said, ‘Let days speak,
JOB.32.7	and many years teach wisdom.’
JOB.32.8	But it is the spirit in a man,
JOB.32.8	the breath of the Almighty, that makes him understand.
JOB.32.9	It is not the old
JOB.32.9	nor the aged that understand what is right.
JOB.32.10	Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me;
JOB.32.10	let me also declare my opinion.’
JOB.32.11	“Behold, I waited for your words,
JOB.32.11	I listened for your wise sayings,
JOB.32.11	while you searched out what to say.
JOB.32.12	I gave you my attention,
JOB.32.12	and, behold, there was none that confuted Job,
JOB.32.12	or that answered his words, among you.
JOB.32.13	Beware lest you say, ‘We have found wisdom;
JOB.32.13	God may vanquish him, not man.’
JOB.32.14	He has not directed his words against me,
JOB.32.14	and I will not answer him with your speeches.
JOB.32.15	“They are discomfited, they answer no more;
JOB.32.15	they have not a word to say.
JOB.32.16	And shall I wait, because they do not speak,
JOB.32.16	because they stand there, and answer no more?
JOB.32.17	I also will give my answer;
JOB.32.17	I also will declare my opinion.
JOB.32.18	For I am full of words,
JOB.32.18	the spirit within me constrains me.
JOB.32.19	Behold, my heart is like wine that has no vent;
JOB.32.19	like new wineskins, it is ready to burst.
JOB.32.20	I must speak, that I may find relief;
JOB.32.20	I must open my lips and answer.
JOB.32.21	I will not show partiality to any person
JOB.32.21	or use flattery toward any man.
JOB.32.22	For I do not know how to flatter,
JOB.32.22	else would my Maker soon put an end to me.
JOB.33.1	“But now, hear my speech, O Job,
JOB.33.1	and listen to all my words.
JOB.33.2	Behold, I open my mouth;
JOB.33.2	the tongue in my mouth speaks.
JOB.33.3	My words declare the uprightness of my heart,
JOB.33.3	and what my lips know they speak sincerely.
JOB.33.4	The spirit of God has made me,
JOB.33.4	and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
JOB.33.5	Answer me, if you can;
JOB.33.5	set your words in order before me; take your stand.
JOB.33.6	Behold, I am toward God as you are;
JOB.33.6	I too was formed from a piece of clay.
JOB.33.7	Behold, no fear of me need terrify you;
JOB.33.7	my pressure will not be heavy upon you.
JOB.33.8	“Surely, you have spoken in my hearing,
JOB.33.8	and I have heard the sound of your words.
JOB.33.9	You say, ‘I am clean, without transgression;
JOB.33.9	I am pure, and there is no iniquity in me.
JOB.33.10	Behold, he finds occasions against me,
JOB.33.10	he counts me as his enemy;
JOB.33.11	he puts my feet in the stocks,
JOB.33.11	and watches all my paths.’
JOB.33.12	“Behold, in this you are not right. I will answer you.
JOB.33.12	God is greater than man.
JOB.33.13	Why do you contend against him,
JOB.33.13	saying, ‘He will answer none of my
JOB.33.14	For God speaks in one way,
JOB.33.14	and in two, though man does not perceive it.
JOB.33.15	In a dream, in a vision of the night,
JOB.33.15	when deep sleep falls upon men,
JOB.33.15	while they slumber on their beds,
JOB.33.16	then he opens the ears of men,
JOB.33.16	and terrifies them with warnings,
JOB.33.17	that he may turn man aside from his deed,
JOB.33.17	and cut off
JOB.33.18	he keeps back his soul from the Pit,
JOB.33.18	his life from perishing by the sword.
JOB.33.19	“Man is also chastened with pain upon his bed,
JOB.33.19	and with continual strife in his bones;
JOB.33.20	so that his life loathes bread,
JOB.33.20	and his appetite dainty food.
JOB.33.21	His flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen;
JOB.33.21	and his bones which were not seen stick out.
JOB.33.22	His soul draws near the Pit,
JOB.33.22	and his life to those who bring death.
JOB.33.23	If there be for him an angel,
JOB.33.23	a mediator, one of the thousand,
JOB.33.23	to declare to man what is right for him;
JOB.33.24	and he is gracious to him, and says,
JOB.33.24	‘Deliver him from going down into the Pit,
JOB.33.24	I have found a ransom;
JOB.33.25	let his flesh become fresh with youth;
JOB.33.25	let him return to the days of his youthful vigor’;
JOB.33.26	then man prays to God, and he accepts him,
JOB.33.26	he comes into his presence with joy.
JOB.33.26	He recounts
JOB.33.27	and he sings before men, and says:
JOB.33.27	‘I sinned, and perverted what was right,
JOB.33.27	and it was not requited to me.
JOB.33.28	He has redeemed my soul from going down into the Pit,
JOB.33.28	and my life shall see the light.’
JOB.33.29	“Behold, God does all these things,
JOB.33.29	twice, three times, with a man,
JOB.33.30	to bring back his soul from the Pit,
JOB.33.30	that he may see the light of life.
JOB.33.31	Give heed, O Job, listen to me;
JOB.33.31	be silent, and I will speak.
JOB.33.32	If you have anything to say, answer me;
JOB.33.32	speak, for I desire to justify you.
JOB.33.33	If not, listen to me;
JOB.33.33	be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.”
JOB.34.1	Then Elihu said:
JOB.34.2	“Hear my words, you wise men,
JOB.34.2	and give ear to me, you who know;
JOB.34.3	for the ear tests words
JOB.34.3	as the palate tastes food.
JOB.34.4	Let us choose what is right;
JOB.34.4	let us determine among ourselves what is good.
JOB.34.5	For Job has said, ‘I am innocent,
JOB.34.5	and God has taken away my right;
JOB.34.6	in spite of my right I am counted a liar;
JOB.34.6	my wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.’
JOB.34.7	What man is like Job,
JOB.34.7	who drinks up scoffing like water,
JOB.34.8	who goes in company with evildoers
JOB.34.8	and walks with wicked men?
JOB.34.9	For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing
JOB.34.9	that he should take delight in God.’
JOB.34.10	“Therefore, hear me, you men of understanding,
JOB.34.10	far be it from God that he should do wickedness,
JOB.34.10	and from the Almighty that he should do wrong.
JOB.34.11	For according to the work of a man he will requite him,
JOB.34.11	and according to his ways he will make it befall him.
JOB.34.12	Of a truth, God will not do wickedly,
JOB.34.12	and the Almighty will not pervert justice.
JOB.34.13	Who gave him charge over the earth
JOB.34.13	and who laid on him
JOB.34.14	If he should take back his spirit
JOB.34.14	and gather to himself his breath,
JOB.34.15	all flesh would perish together,
JOB.34.15	and man would return to dust.
JOB.34.16	“If you have understanding, hear this;
JOB.34.16	listen to what I say.
JOB.34.17	Shall one who hates justice govern?
JOB.34.17	Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty,
JOB.34.18	who says to a king, ‘Worthless one,’
JOB.34.18	and to nobles, ‘Wicked man’;
JOB.34.19	who shows no partiality to princes,
JOB.34.19	nor regards the rich more than the poor,
JOB.34.19	for they are all the work of his hands?
JOB.34.20	In a moment they die;
JOB.34.20	at midnight the people are shaken and pass away,
JOB.34.20	and the mighty are taken away by no human hand.
JOB.34.21	“For his eyes are upon the ways of a man,
JOB.34.21	and he sees all his steps.
JOB.34.22	There is no gloom or deep darkness
JOB.34.22	where evildoers may hide themselves.
JOB.34.23	For he has not appointed a time
JOB.34.23	to go before God in judgment.
JOB.34.24	He shatters the mighty without investigation,
JOB.34.24	and sets others in their place.
JOB.34.25	Thus, knowing their works,
JOB.34.25	he overturns them in the night, and they are crushed.
JOB.34.26	He strikes them for their wickedness
JOB.34.26	in the sight of men,
JOB.34.27	because they turned aside from following him,
JOB.34.27	and had no regard for any of his ways,
JOB.34.28	so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him,
JOB.34.28	and he heard the cry of the afflicted—
JOB.34.29	When he is quiet, who can condemn?
JOB.34.29	When he hides his face, who can behold him,
JOB.34.29	whether it be a nation or a man?—
JOB.34.30	that a godless man should not reign,
JOB.34.30	that he should not ensnare the people.
JOB.34.31	“For has any one said to God,
JOB.34.31	‘I have borne chastisement; I will not offend any more;
JOB.34.32	teach me what I do not see;
JOB.34.32	if I have done iniquity, I will do it no more’?
JOB.34.33	Will he then make requital to suit you,
JOB.34.33	because you reject it?
JOB.34.33	For you must choose, and not I;
JOB.34.33	therefore declare what you know.
JOB.34.34	Men of understanding will say to me,
JOB.34.34	and the wise man who hears me will say:
JOB.34.35	‘Job speaks without knowledge,
JOB.34.35	his words are without insight.’
JOB.34.36	Would that Job were tried to the end,
JOB.34.36	because he answers like wicked men.
JOB.34.37	For he adds rebellion to his sin;
JOB.34.37	he claps his hands among us,
JOB.34.37	and multiplies his words against God.”
JOB.35.1	And Elihu said:
JOB.35.2	“Do you think this to be just?
JOB.35.2	Do you say, ‘It is my right before God,’
JOB.35.3	that you ask, ‘What advantage have I?
JOB.35.3	How am I better off than if I had sinned?’
JOB.35.4	I will answer you
JOB.35.4	and your friends with you.
JOB.35.5	Look at the heavens, and see;
JOB.35.5	and behold the clouds, which are higher than you.
JOB.35.6	And if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?
JOB.35.7	If you are righteous, what do you give to him;
JOB.35.7	or what does he receive from your hand?
JOB.35.8	Your wickedness concerns a man like yourself,
JOB.35.8	and your righteousness a son of man.
JOB.35.9	“Because of the multitude of oppressions people cry out;
JOB.35.9	they call for help because of the arm of the mighty.
JOB.35.10	But none says, ‘Where is God my Maker,
JOB.35.10	who gives songs in the night,
JOB.35.11	who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth,
JOB.35.11	and makes us wiser than the birds of the air?’
JOB.35.12	There they cry out, but he does not answer,
JOB.35.12	because of the pride of evil men.
JOB.35.13	Surely God does not hear an empty cry,
JOB.35.13	nor does the Almighty regard it.
JOB.35.14	How much less when you say that you do not see him,
JOB.35.14	that the case is before him, and you are waiting for him!
JOB.35.15	And now, because his anger does not punish,
JOB.35.15	and he does not greatly heed transgression,
JOB.35.16	Job opens his mouth in empty talk,
JOB.35.16	he multiplies words without knowledge.”
JOB.36.1	And Elihu continued, and said:
JOB.36.2	“Bear with me a little, and I will show you,
JOB.36.2	for I have yet something to say on God's behalf.
JOB.36.3	I will fetch my knowledge from afar,
JOB.36.3	and ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
JOB.36.4	For truly my words are not false;
JOB.36.4	one who is perfect in knowledge is with you.
JOB.36.5	“Behold, God is mighty, and does not despise any;
JOB.36.5	he is mighty in strength of understanding.
JOB.36.6	He does not keep the wicked alive,
JOB.36.6	but gives the afflicted their right.
JOB.36.7	He does not withdraw his eyes from the righteous,
JOB.36.7	but with kings upon the throne
JOB.36.7	he sets them for ever, and they are exalted.
JOB.36.8	And if they are bound in fetters
JOB.36.8	and caught in the cords of affliction,
JOB.36.9	then he declares to them their work
JOB.36.9	and their transgressions, that they are behaving arrogantly.
JOB.36.10	He opens their ears to instruction,
JOB.36.10	and commands that they return from iniquity.
JOB.36.11	If they hearken and serve him,
JOB.36.11	they complete their days in prosperity,
JOB.36.11	and their years in pleasantness.
JOB.36.12	But if they do not hearken, they perish by the sword,
JOB.36.12	and die without knowledge.
JOB.36.13	“The godless in heart cherish anger;
JOB.36.13	they do not cry for help when he binds them.
JOB.36.14	They die in youth,
JOB.36.14	and their life ends in shame.
JOB.36.15	He delivers the afflicted by their affliction,
JOB.36.15	and opens their ear by adversity.
JOB.36.16	He also allured you out of distress
JOB.36.16	into a broad place where there was no cramping,
JOB.36.16	and what was set on your table was full of fatness.
JOB.36.17	“But you are full of the judgment on the wicked;
JOB.36.17	judgment and justice seize you.
JOB.36.18	Beware lest wrath entice you into scoffing;
JOB.36.18	and let not the greatness of the ransom turn you aside.
JOB.36.19	Will your cry avail to keep you from distress,
JOB.36.19	or all the force of your strength?
JOB.36.20	Do not long for the night,
JOB.36.20	when peoples are cut off in their place.
JOB.36.21	Take heed, do not turn to iniquity,
JOB.36.21	for this you have chosen rather than affliction.
JOB.36.22	Behold, God is exalted in his power;
JOB.36.22	who is a teacher like him?
JOB.36.23	Who has prescribed for him his way,
JOB.36.23	or who can say, ‘Thou hast done wrong’?
JOB.36.24	“Remember to extol his work,
JOB.36.24	of which men have sung.
JOB.36.25	All men have looked on it;
JOB.36.25	man beholds it from afar.
JOB.36.26	Behold, God is great, and we know him not;
JOB.36.26	the number of his years is unsearchable.
JOB.36.27	For he draws up the drops of water,
JOB.36.27	he
JOB.36.28	which the skies pour down,
JOB.36.28	and drop upon man abundantly.
JOB.36.29	Can any one understand the spreading of the clouds,
JOB.36.29	the thunderings of his pavilion?
JOB.36.30	Behold, he scatters his lightning about him,
JOB.36.30	and covers the roots of the sea.
JOB.36.31	For by these he judges peoples;
JOB.36.31	he gives food in abundance.
JOB.36.32	He covers his hands with the lightning,
JOB.36.32	and commands it to strike the mark.
JOB.36.33	Its crashing declares concerning him,
JOB.36.33	who is jealous with anger against iniquity.
JOB.37.1	“At this also my heart trembles,
JOB.37.1	and leaps out of its place.
JOB.37.2	Hearken to the thunder of his voice
JOB.37.2	and the rumbling that comes from his mouth.
JOB.37.3	Under the whole heaven he lets it go,
JOB.37.3	and his lightning to the corners of the earth.
JOB.37.4	After it his voice roars;
JOB.37.4	he thunders with his majestic voice
JOB.37.4	and he does not restrain the lightnings
JOB.37.5	God thunders wondrously with his voice;
JOB.37.5	he does great things which we cannot comprehend.
JOB.37.6	For to the snow he says, ‘Fall on the earth’;
JOB.37.6	and to the shower and the rain,
JOB.37.7	He seals up the hand of every man,
JOB.37.7	that all men may know his work.
JOB.37.8	Then the beasts go into their lairs,
JOB.37.8	and remain in their dens.
JOB.37.9	From its chamber comes the whirlwind,
JOB.37.9	and cold from the scattering winds.
JOB.37.10	By the breath of God ice is given,
JOB.37.10	and the broad waters are frozen fast.
JOB.37.11	He loads the thick cloud with moisture;
JOB.37.11	the clouds scatter his lightning.
JOB.37.12	They turn round and round by his guidance,
JOB.37.12	to accomplish all that he commands them
JOB.37.12	on the face of the habitable world.
JOB.37.13	Whether for correction, or for his land,
JOB.37.13	or for love, he causes it to happen.
JOB.37.14	“Hear this, O Job;
JOB.37.14	stop and consider the wondrous works of God.
JOB.37.15	Do you know how God lays his command upon them,
JOB.37.15	and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine?
JOB.37.16	Do you know the balancings of the clouds,
JOB.37.16	the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge,
JOB.37.17	you whose garments are hot
JOB.37.17	when the earth is still because of the south wind?
JOB.37.18	Can you, like him, spread out the skies,
JOB.37.18	hard as a molten mirror?
JOB.37.19	Teach us what we shall say to him;
JOB.37.19	we cannot draw up our case because of darkness.
JOB.37.20	Shall it be told him that I would speak?
JOB.37.20	Did a man ever wish that he would be swallowed up?
JOB.37.21	“And now men cannot look on the light
JOB.37.21	when it is bright in the skies,
JOB.37.21	when the wind has passed and cleared them.
JOB.37.22	Out of the north comes golden splendor;
JOB.37.22	God is clothed with terrible majesty.
JOB.37.23	The Almighty—we cannot find him;
JOB.37.23	he is great in power and justice,
JOB.37.23	and abundant righteousness he will not violate.
JOB.37.24	Therefore men fear him;
JOB.37.24	he does not regard any who are wise in their own conceit.”
JOB.38.1	Then the 
JOB.38.2	“Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?
JOB.38.3	Gird up your loins like a man,
JOB.38.3	I will question you, and you shall declare to me.
JOB.38.4	“Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?
JOB.38.4	Tell me, if you have understanding.
JOB.38.5	Who determined its measurements—surely you know!
JOB.38.5	Or who stretched the line upon it?
JOB.38.6	On what were its bases sunk,
JOB.38.6	or who laid its cornerstone,
JOB.38.7	when the morning stars sang together,
JOB.38.7	and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
JOB.38.8	“Or who shut in the sea with doors,
JOB.38.8	when it burst forth from the womb;
JOB.38.9	when I made clouds its garment,
JOB.38.9	and thick darkness its swaddling band,
JOB.38.10	and set bars and doors,
JOB.38.11	and said, ‘Thus far shall you come, and no farther,
JOB.38.11	and here shall your proud waves be stayed’?
JOB.38.12	“Have you commanded the morning since your days began,
JOB.38.12	and caused the dawn to know its place,
JOB.38.13	that it might take hold of the skirts of the earth,
JOB.38.13	and the wicked be shaken out of it?
JOB.38.14	It is changed like clay under the seal,
JOB.38.14	and it is dyed
JOB.38.15	From the wicked their light is withheld,
JOB.38.15	and their uplifted arm is broken.
JOB.38.16	“Have you entered into the springs of the sea,
JOB.38.16	or walked in the recesses of the deep?
JOB.38.17	Have the gates of death been revealed to you,
JOB.38.17	or have you seen the gates of deep darkness?
JOB.38.18	Have you comprehended the expanse of the earth?
JOB.38.18	Declare, if you know all this.
JOB.38.19	“Where is the way to the dwelling of light,
JOB.38.19	and where is the place of darkness,
JOB.38.20	that you may take it to its territory
JOB.38.20	and that you may discern the paths to its home?
JOB.38.21	You know, for you were born then,
JOB.38.21	and the number of your days is great!
JOB.38.22	“Have you entered the storehouses of the snow,
JOB.38.22	or have you seen the storehouses of the hail,
JOB.38.23	which I have reserved for the time of trouble,
JOB.38.23	for the day of battle and war?
JOB.38.24	What is the way to the place where the light is distributed,
JOB.38.24	or where the east wind is scattered upon the earth?
JOB.38.25	“Who has cleft a channel for the torents of rain,
JOB.38.25	and a way for the thunderbolt,
JOB.38.26	to bring rain on a land where no man is,
JOB.38.26	on the desert in which there is no man;
JOB.38.27	to satisfy the waste and desolate land,
JOB.38.27	and to make the ground put forth grass?
JOB.38.28	“Has the rain a father,
JOB.38.28	or who has begotten the drops of dew?
JOB.38.29	From whose womb did the ice come forth,
JOB.38.29	and who has given birth to the hoarfrost of heaven?
JOB.38.30	The waters become hard like stone,
JOB.38.30	and the face of the deep is frozen.
JOB.38.31	“Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades,
JOB.38.31	or loose the cords of Orion?
JOB.38.32	Can you lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season,
JOB.38.32	or can you guide the Bear with its children?
JOB.38.33	Do you know the ordinances of the heavens?
JOB.38.33	Can you establish their rule on the earth?
JOB.38.34	“Can you lift up your voice to the clouds,
JOB.38.34	that a flood of waters may cover you?
JOB.38.35	Can you send forth lightnings, that they may go
JOB.38.35	and say to you, ‘Here we are’?
JOB.38.36	Who has put wisdom in the clouds,
JOB.38.36	or given understanding to the mists?
JOB.38.37	Who can number the clouds by wisdom?
JOB.38.37	Or who can tilt the waterskins of the heavens,
JOB.38.38	when the dust runs into a mass
JOB.38.38	and the clods cleave fast together?
JOB.38.39	“Can you hunt the prey for the lion,
JOB.38.39	or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,
JOB.38.40	when they crouch in their dens,
JOB.38.40	or lie in wait in their covert?
JOB.38.41	Who provides for the raven its prey,
JOB.38.41	when its young ones cry to God,
JOB.38.41	and wander about for lack of food?
JOB.39.1	“Do you know when the mountain goats bring forth?
JOB.39.1	Do you observe the calving of the hinds?
JOB.39.2	Can you number the months that they fulfil,
JOB.39.2	and do you know the time when they bring forth,
JOB.39.3	when they crouch, bring forth their offspring,
JOB.39.3	and are delivered of their young?
JOB.39.4	Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open;
JOB.39.4	they go forth, and do not return to them.
JOB.39.5	“Who has let the wild ass go free?
JOB.39.5	Who has loosed the bonds of the swift ass,
JOB.39.6	to whom I have given the steppe for his home,
JOB.39.6	and the salt land for his dwelling place?
JOB.39.7	He scorns the tumult of the city;
JOB.39.7	he hears not the shouts of the driver.
JOB.39.8	He ranges the mountains as his pasture,
JOB.39.8	and he searches after every green thing.
JOB.39.9	“Is the wild ox willing to serve you?
JOB.39.9	Will he spend the night at your crib?
JOB.39.10	Can you bind him in the furrow with ropes,
JOB.39.10	or will he harrow the valleys after you?
JOB.39.11	Will you depend on him because his strength is great,
JOB.39.11	and will you leave to him your labor?
JOB.39.12	Do you have faith in him that he will return,
JOB.39.12	and bring your grain to your threshing floor?
JOB.39.13	“The wings of the ostrich wave proudly;
JOB.39.13	but are they the pinions and plumage of love?
JOB.39.14	For she leaves her eggs to the earth,
JOB.39.14	and lets them be warmed on the ground,
JOB.39.15	forgetting that a foot may crush them,
JOB.39.15	and that the wild beast may trample them.
JOB.39.16	She deals cruelly with her young, as if they were not hers;
JOB.39.16	though her labor be in vain, yet she has no fear;
JOB.39.17	because God has made her forget wisdom,
JOB.39.17	and given her no share in understanding.
JOB.39.18	When she rouses herself to flee,
JOB.39.18	she laughs at the horse and his rider.
JOB.39.19	“Do you give the horse his might?
JOB.39.19	Do you clothe his neck with strength?
JOB.39.20	Do you make him leap like the locust?
JOB.39.20	His majestic snorting is terrible.
JOB.39.21	He paws
JOB.39.21	he goes out to meet the weapons.
JOB.39.22	He laughs at fear, and is not dismayed;
JOB.39.22	he does not turn back from the sword.
JOB.39.23	Upon him rattle the quiver,
JOB.39.23	the flashing spear and the javelin.
JOB.39.24	With fierceness and rage he swallows the ground;
JOB.39.24	he cannot stand still at the sound of the trumpet.
JOB.39.25	When the trumpet sounds, he says ‘Aha!’
JOB.39.25	He smells the battle from afar,
JOB.39.25	the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
JOB.39.26	“Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars,
JOB.39.26	and spreads his wings toward the south?
JOB.39.27	Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up
JOB.39.27	and makes his nest on high?
JOB.39.28	On the rock he dwells and makes his home
JOB.39.28	in the fastness of the rocky crag.
JOB.39.29	Thence he spies out the prey;
JOB.39.29	his eyes behold it afar off.
JOB.39.30	His young ones suck up blood;
JOB.39.30	and where the slain are, there is he.”
JOB.40.1	And the 
JOB.40.2	“Shall a faultfinder contend with the Almighty?
JOB.40.2	He who argues with God, let him answer it.”
JOB.40.3	Then Job answered the 
JOB.40.4	“Behold, I am of small account; what shall I answer thee?
JOB.40.4	I lay my hand on my mouth.
JOB.40.5	I have spoken once, and I will not answer;
JOB.40.5	twice, but I will proceed no further.”
JOB.40.6	Then the 
JOB.40.7	“Gird up your loins like a man;
JOB.40.7	I will question you, and you declare to me.
JOB.40.8	Will you even put me in the wrong?
JOB.40.8	Will you condemn me that you may be justified?
JOB.40.9	Have you an arm like God,
JOB.40.9	and can you thunder with a voice like his?
JOB.40.10	“Deck yourself with majesty and dignity;
JOB.40.10	clothe yourself with glory and splendor.
JOB.40.11	Pour forth the overflowings of your anger,
JOB.40.11	and look on every one that is proud, and abase him.
JOB.40.12	Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low;
JOB.40.12	and tread down the wicked where they stand.
JOB.40.13	Hide them all in the dust together;
JOB.40.13	bind their faces in the world below.
JOB.40.14	Then will I also acknowledge to you,
JOB.40.14	that your own right hand can give you victory.
JOB.40.15	“Behold, Behemoth,
JOB.40.15	which I made as I made you;
JOB.40.15	he eats grass like an ox.
JOB.40.16	Behold, his strength in his loins,
JOB.40.16	and his power in the muscles of his belly.
JOB.40.17	He makes his tail stiff like a cedar;
JOB.40.17	the sinews of his thighs are knit together.
JOB.40.18	His bones are tubes of bronze,
JOB.40.18	his limbs like bars of iron.
JOB.40.19	“He is the first of the works
JOB.40.19	let him who made him bring near his sword!
JOB.40.20	For the mountains yield food for him
JOB.40.20	where all the wild beasts play.
JOB.40.21	Under the lotus plants he lies,
JOB.40.21	in the covert of the reeds and in the marsh.
JOB.40.22	For his shade the lotus trees cover him;
JOB.40.22	the willows of the brook surround him.
JOB.40.23	Behold, if the river is turbulent he is not frightened;
JOB.40.23	he is confident though Jordan rushes against his mouth.
JOB.40.24	Can one take him with hooks,
JOB.40.24	or pierce his nose with a snare?
JOB.41.1	or press down his tongue with a cord?
JOB.41.2	Can you put a rope in his nose,
JOB.41.2	or pierce his jaw with a hook?
JOB.41.3	Will he make many supplications to you?
JOB.41.3	Will he speak to you soft words?
JOB.41.4	Will he make a covenant with you
JOB.41.4	to take him for your servant for ever?
JOB.41.5	Will you play with him as with a bird,
JOB.41.5	or will you put him on leash for your maidens?
JOB.41.6	Will traders bargain over him?
JOB.41.6	Will they divide him up among the merchants?
JOB.41.7	Can you fill his skin with harpoons,
JOB.41.7	or his head with fishing spears?
JOB.41.8	Lay hands on him;
JOB.41.8	think of the battle; you will not do it again!
JOB.41.9	he is laid low even at the sight of him.
JOB.41.10	No one is so fierce that he dares to stir him up.
JOB.41.10	Who then is he that can stand before me?
JOB.41.11	Whatever is under the whole heaven is mine.
JOB.41.12	“I will not keep silence concerning his limbs,
JOB.41.12	or his mighty strength, or his goodly frame.
JOB.41.13	Who can strip off his outer garment?
JOB.41.13	Who can penetrate his double coat of mail?
JOB.41.14	Who can open the doors of his face?
JOB.41.14	Round about his teeth is terror.
JOB.41.15	His back
JOB.41.15	shut up closely as with a seal.
JOB.41.16	One is so near to another
JOB.41.16	that no air can come between them.
JOB.41.17	They are joined one to another;
JOB.41.17	they clasp each other and cannot be separated.
JOB.41.18	His sneezings flash forth light,
JOB.41.18	and his eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn.
JOB.41.19	Out of his mouth go flaming torches;
JOB.41.19	sparks of fire leap forth.
JOB.41.20	Out of his nostrils comes forth smoke,
JOB.41.20	as from a boiling pot and burning rushes.
JOB.41.21	His breath kindles coals,
JOB.41.21	and a flame comes forth from his mouth.
JOB.41.22	In his neck abides strength,
JOB.41.22	and terror dances before him.
JOB.41.23	The folds of his flesh cleave together,
JOB.41.23	firmly cast upon him and immovable.
JOB.41.24	His heart is hard as a stone,
JOB.41.24	hard as the nether millstone.
JOB.41.25	When he raises himself up the mighty
JOB.41.25	at the crashing they are beside themselves.
JOB.41.26	Though the sword reaches him, it does not avail;
JOB.41.26	nor the spear, the dart, or the javelin.
JOB.41.27	He counts iron as straw,
JOB.41.27	and bronze as rotten wood.
JOB.41.28	The arrow cannot make him flee;
JOB.41.28	for him slingstones are turned to stubble.
JOB.41.29	Clubs are counted as stubble;
JOB.41.29	he laughs at the rattle of javelins.
JOB.41.30	His underparts are like sharp potsherds;
JOB.41.30	he spreads himself like a threshing sledge on the mire.
JOB.41.31	He makes the deep boil like a pot;
JOB.41.31	he makes the sea like a pot of ointment.
JOB.41.32	Behind him he leaves a shining wake;
JOB.41.32	one would think the deep to be hoary.
JOB.41.33	Upon earth there is not his like,
JOB.41.33	a creature without fear.
JOB.41.34	He beholds everything that is high;
JOB.41.34	he is king over all the sons of pride.”
JOB.42.1	Then Job answered the 
JOB.42.2	“I know that thou canst do all things,
JOB.42.2	and that no purpose of thine can be thwarted.
JOB.42.3	‘Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?’
JOB.42.3	Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand,
JOB.42.3	things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.
JOB.42.4	‘Hear, and I will speak;
JOB.42.4	I will question you, and you declare to me.’
JOB.42.5	I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear,
JOB.42.5	but now my eye sees thee;
JOB.42.6	therefore I despise myself,
JOB.42.6	and repent in dust and ashes.”
JOB.42.7	After the 
JOB.42.8	Now therefore take seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept his prayer not to deal with you according to your folly; for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.” 
JOB.42.9	So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did what the 
JOB.42.10	And the 
JOB.42.11	Then came to him all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before, and ate bread with him in his house; and they showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the evil that the 
JOB.42.12	And the 
JOB.42.13	He had also seven sons and three daughters. 
JOB.42.14	And he called the name of the first Jemimah; and the name of the second Keziah; and the name of the third Keren-happuch. 
JOB.42.15	And in all the land there were no women so fair as Job's daughters; and their father gave them inheritance among their brothers. 
JOB.42.16	And after this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, four generations. 
JOB.42.17	And Job died, an old man, and full of days.
PSA.1.1	who walks not in the counsel of the wicked,
PSA.1.1	nor stands in the way of sinners,
PSA.1.1	nor sits in the seat of scoffers;
PSA.1.2	but his delight is in the law of the 
PSA.1.2	and on his law he meditates day and night.
PSA.1.3	He is like a tree
PSA.1.3	planted by streams of water,
PSA.1.3	that yields its fruit in its season,
PSA.1.3	and its leaf does not wither.
PSA.1.3	In all that he does, he prospers.
PSA.1.4	The wicked are not so,
PSA.1.4	but are like chaff which the wind drives away.
PSA.1.5	Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
PSA.1.5	nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous;
PSA.1.6	for the 
PSA.1.6	but the way of the wicked will perish.
PSA.2.1	and the peoples plot in vain?
PSA.2.2	The kings of the earth set themselves,
PSA.2.2	and the rulers take counsel together,
PSA.2.2	against the 
PSA.2.3	“Let us burst their bonds asunder,
PSA.2.3	and cast their cords from us.”
PSA.2.4	He who sits in the heavens laughs;
PSA.2.4	the 
PSA.2.5	Then he will speak to them in his wrath,
PSA.2.5	and terrify them in his fury, saying,
PSA.2.6	“I have set my king
PSA.2.6	on Zion, my holy hill.”
PSA.2.7	He said to me, “You are my son,
PSA.2.7	today I have begotten you.
PSA.2.8	and the ends of the earth your possession.
PSA.2.9	You shall break them with a rod of iron,
PSA.2.9	and dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.”
PSA.2.10	Now therefore, O kings, be wise;
PSA.2.10	be warned, O rulers of the earth.
PSA.2.11	Serve the 
PSA.2.11	with trembling 
PSA.2.12	kiss his feet,
PSA.2.12	lest he be angry, and you perish in the way;
PSA.2.12	for his wrath is quickly kindled.
PSA.2.12	Blessed are all who take refuge in him.
PSA.3.1	O 
PSA.3.1	Many are rising against me;
PSA.3.2	many are saying of me,
PSA.3.2	there is no help for him in God. 
PSA.3.3	But thou, O 
PSA.3.3	my glory, and the lifter of my head.
PSA.3.4	I cry aloud to the 
PSA.3.4	and he answers me from his holy hill. 
PSA.3.5	I lie down and sleep;
PSA.3.5	I wake again, for the 
PSA.3.6	I am not afraid of ten thousands of people
PSA.3.6	who have set themselves against me round about.
PSA.3.7	Arise, O 
PSA.3.7	Deliver me, O my God!
PSA.3.7	For thou dost smite all my enemies on the cheek,
PSA.3.7	thou dost break the teeth of the wicked.
PSA.3.8	Deliverance belongs to the 
PSA.3.8	thy blessing be upon thy people! 
PSA.4.1	Answer me when I call, O God of my right!
PSA.4.1	Thou hast given me room when I was in distress.
PSA.4.1	Be gracious to me, and hear my prayer.
PSA.4.2	O men, how long shall my honor suffer shame?
PSA.4.2	How long will you love vain words, and seek after lies? 
PSA.4.3	But know that the 
PSA.4.3	the 
PSA.4.4	commune with your own hearts on your beds, and be silent. 
PSA.4.5	Offer right sacrifices,
PSA.4.5	and put your trust in the 
PSA.4.6	There are many who say, “O that we might see some good!
PSA.4.6	Lift up the light of thy countenance upon us, O 
PSA.4.7	Thou hast put more joy in my heart
PSA.4.7	than they have when their grain and wine abound.
PSA.4.8	In peace I will both lie down and sleep;
PSA.4.8	for thou alone, O 
PSA.5.1	Give ear to my words, O 
PSA.5.1	give heed to my groaning.
PSA.5.2	Hearken to the sound of my cry,
PSA.5.2	my King and my God,
PSA.5.2	for to thee do I pray.
PSA.5.3	O 
PSA.5.3	in the morning I prepare a sacrifice for thee, and watch.
PSA.5.4	For thou art not a God who delights in wickedness;
PSA.5.4	evil may not sojourn with thee.
PSA.5.5	The boastful may not stand before thy eyes;
PSA.5.5	thou hatest all evildoers.
PSA.5.6	Thou destroyest those who speak lies;
PSA.5.6	the 
PSA.5.7	But I through the abundance of thy steadfast love
PSA.5.7	will enter thy house,
PSA.5.7	I will worship toward thy holy temple
PSA.5.7	in the fear of thee.
PSA.5.8	Lead me, O 
PSA.5.8	because of my enemies;
PSA.5.8	make thy way straight before me.
PSA.5.9	their heart is destruction,
PSA.5.9	their throat is an open sepulchre,
PSA.5.9	they flatter with their tongue.
PSA.5.10	Make them bear their guilt, O God;
PSA.5.10	let them fall by their own counsels;
PSA.5.10	because of their many transgressions cast them out,
PSA.5.10	for they have rebelled against thee.
PSA.5.11	But let all who take refuge in thee rejoice,
PSA.5.11	let them ever sing for joy;
PSA.5.11	and do thou defend them,
PSA.5.11	that those who love thy name may exult in thee.
PSA.5.12	For thou dost bless the righteous, O 
PSA.5.12	thou dost cover him with favor as with a shield.
PSA.6.1	O 
PSA.6.1	nor chasten me in thy wrath.
PSA.6.2	Be gracious to me, O 
PSA.6.2	O 
PSA.6.3	My soul also is sorely troubled.
PSA.6.3	But thou, O 
PSA.6.4	Turn, O 
PSA.6.4	deliver me for the sake of thy steadfast love.
PSA.6.5	For in death there is no remembrance of thee;
PSA.6.5	in Sheol who can give thee praise?
PSA.6.6	I am weary with my moaning;
PSA.6.6	every night I flood my bed with tears;
PSA.6.6	I drench my couch with my weeping.
PSA.6.7	My eye wastes away because of grief,
PSA.6.7	it grows weak because of all my foes.
PSA.6.8	for the 
PSA.6.9	The 
PSA.6.9	the 
PSA.6.10	All my enemies shall be ashamed and sorely troubled;
PSA.6.10	they shall turn back, and be put to shame in a moment.
PSA.7.1	O 
PSA.7.1	save me from all my pursuers, and deliver me,
PSA.7.2	lest like a lion they rend me,
PSA.7.2	dragging me away, with none to rescue.
PSA.7.3	O 
PSA.7.3	if there is wrong in my hands,
PSA.7.4	if I have requited my friend with evil
PSA.7.4	or plundered my enemy without cause,
PSA.7.5	let the enemy pursue me and overtake me,
PSA.7.5	and let him trample my life to the ground,
PSA.7.5	and lay my soul in the dust. 
PSA.7.6	Arise, O 
PSA.7.6	lift thyself up against the fury of my enemies;
PSA.7.6	awake, O my God;
PSA.7.7	Let the assembly of the peoples be gathered about thee;
PSA.7.7	and over it take thy seat
PSA.7.8	The 
PSA.7.8	judge me, O 
PSA.7.8	and according to the integrity that is in me.
PSA.7.9	but establish thou the righteous,
PSA.7.9	thou who triest the minds and hearts,
PSA.7.9	thou righteous God.
PSA.7.10	My shield is with God,
PSA.7.10	who saves the upright in heart.
PSA.7.11	God is a righteous judge,
PSA.7.11	and a God who has indignation every day.
PSA.7.12	If a man
PSA.7.12	he has bent and strung his bow;
PSA.7.13	he has prepared his deadly weapons,
PSA.7.13	making his arrows fiery shafts.
PSA.7.14	Behold, the wicked man conceives evil,
PSA.7.14	and is pregnant with mischief,
PSA.7.14	and brings forth lies.
PSA.7.15	He makes a pit, digging it out,
PSA.7.15	and falls into the hole which he has made.
PSA.7.16	His mischief returns upon his own head,
PSA.7.16	and on his own pate his violence descends.
PSA.7.17	I will give to the 
PSA.7.17	and I will sing praise to the name of the 
PSA.8.1	O 
PSA.8.1	how majestic is thy name in all the earth!
PSA.8.1	Thou whose glory above the heavens is chanted
PSA.8.2	thou hast founded a bulwark because of thy foes,
PSA.8.2	to still the enemy and the avenger.
PSA.8.3	When I look at thy heavens, the work of thy fingers,
PSA.8.3	the moon and the stars which thou hast established;
PSA.8.4	and the son of man that thou dost care for him?
PSA.8.5	Yet thou hast made him little less than God,
PSA.8.5	and dost crown him with glory and honor.
PSA.8.6	thou hast put all things under his feet,
PSA.8.7	all sheep and oxen,
PSA.8.7	and also the beasts of the field,
PSA.8.8	the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea,
PSA.8.8	whatever passes along the paths of the sea.
PSA.8.9	O 
PSA.8.9	how majestic is thy name in all the earth!
PSA.9.1	I will give thanks to the 
PSA.9.1	I will tell of all thy wonderful deeds.
PSA.9.2	I will be glad and exult in thee,
PSA.9.2	I will sing praise to thy name, O Most High.
PSA.9.3	When my enemies turned back,
PSA.9.3	they stumbled and perished before thee.
PSA.9.4	For thou hast maintained my just cause;
PSA.9.4	thou hast sat on the throne giving righteous judgment.
PSA.9.5	Thou hast rebuked the nations, thou hast destroyed the wicked;
PSA.9.5	thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever.
PSA.9.6	The enemy have vanished in everlasting ruins;
PSA.9.6	their cities thou hast rooted out;
PSA.9.6	the very memory of them has perished.
PSA.9.7	But the 
PSA.9.7	he has established his throne for judgment;
PSA.9.8	he judges the peoples with equity.
PSA.9.9	The 
PSA.9.9	a stronghold in times of trouble.
PSA.9.10	And those who know thy name put their trust in thee,
PSA.9.10	for thou, O 
PSA.9.11	Sing praises to the 
PSA.9.11	Tell among the peoples his deeds!
PSA.9.12	For he who avenges blood is mindful of them;
PSA.9.12	he does not forget the cry of the afflicted.
PSA.9.13	Be gracious to me, O 
PSA.9.13	Behold what I suffer from those who hate me,
PSA.9.13	O thou who liftest me up from the gates of death,
PSA.9.14	that I may recount all thy praises,
PSA.9.14	that in the gates of the daughter of Zion
PSA.9.14	I may rejoice in thy deliverance.
PSA.9.15	The nations have sunk in the pit which they made;
PSA.9.15	in the net which they hid has their own foot been caught.
PSA.9.16	The 
PSA.9.16	the wicked are snared in the work of their own hands. 
PSA.9.17	The wicked shall depart to Sheol,
PSA.9.17	all the nations that forget God.
PSA.9.18	For the needy shall not always be forgotten,
PSA.9.18	and the hope of the poor shall not perish for ever.
PSA.9.19	Arise, O 
PSA.9.19	let the nations be judged before thee!
PSA.9.20	Put them in fear, O 
PSA.9.20	Let the nations know that they are but men! 
PSA.10.1	Why dost thou stand afar off, O 
PSA.10.1	Why dost thou hide thyself in times of trouble?
PSA.10.2	In arrogance the wicked hotly pursue the poor;
PSA.10.2	let them be caught in the schemes which they have devised.
PSA.10.3	For the wicked boasts of the desires of his heart,
PSA.10.3	and the man greedy for gain curses and renounces the 
PSA.10.4	In the pride of his countenance the wicked does not seek him;
PSA.10.4	all his thoughts are, “There is no God.”
PSA.10.5	His ways prosper at all times;
PSA.10.5	thy judgments are on high, out of his sight;
PSA.10.5	as for all his foes, he puffs at them.
PSA.10.6	He thinks in his heart, “I shall not be moved;
PSA.10.6	throughout all generations I shall not meet adversity.”
PSA.10.7	under his tongue are mischief and iniquity.
PSA.10.8	He sits in ambush in the villages;
PSA.10.8	in hiding places he murders the innocent.
PSA.10.8	His eyes stealthily watch for the hapless,
PSA.10.9	he lurks in secret like a lion in his covert;
PSA.10.9	he lurks that he may seize the poor,
PSA.10.9	he seizes the poor when he draws him into his net.
PSA.10.10	The hapless is crushed, sinks down,
PSA.10.10	and falls by his might.
PSA.10.11	He thinks in his heart, “God has forgotten,
PSA.10.11	he has hidden his face, he will never see it.”
PSA.10.12	Arise, O 
PSA.10.12	forget not the afflicted.
PSA.10.13	Why does the wicked renounce God,
PSA.10.13	and say in his heart, “Thou wilt not call to account”?
PSA.10.14	Thou dost see; yea, thou dost note trouble and vexation,
PSA.10.14	that thou mayst take it into thy hands;
PSA.10.14	the hapless commits himself to thee;
PSA.10.14	thou hast been the helper of the fatherless.
PSA.10.15	Break thou the arm of the wicked and evildoer;
PSA.10.15	seek out his wickedness till thou find none.
PSA.10.16	The 
PSA.10.16	the nations shall perish from his land.
PSA.10.17	O 
PSA.10.17	thou wilt strengthen their heart, thou wilt incline thy ear
PSA.10.18	to do justice to the fatherless and the oppressed,
PSA.10.18	so that man who is of the earth may strike terror no more.
PSA.11.1	In the 
PSA.11.1	how can you say to me,
PSA.11.1	“Flee like a bird to the mountains;
PSA.11.2	for lo, the wicked bend the bow,
PSA.11.2	they have fitted their arrow to the string,
PSA.11.2	to shoot in the dark at the upright in heart;
PSA.11.3	if the foundations are destroyed,
PSA.11.3	what can the righteous do”?
PSA.11.4	The 
PSA.11.4	the 
PSA.11.4	his eyes behold, his eyelids test, the children of men.
PSA.11.5	The 
PSA.11.5	and his soul hates him that loves violence.
PSA.11.6	On the wicked he will rain coals of fire and brimstone;
PSA.11.6	a scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.
PSA.11.7	For the 
PSA.11.7	the upright shall behold his face.
PSA.12.1	Help, 
PSA.12.1	for the faithful have vanished from among the sons of men.
PSA.12.2	Every one utters lies to his neighbor;
PSA.12.2	with flattering lips and a double heart they speak.
PSA.12.3	May the 
PSA.12.3	the tongue that makes great boasts,
PSA.12.4	those who say, “With our tongue we will prevail,
PSA.12.4	our lips are with us; who is our master?”
PSA.12.5	“Because the poor are despoiled, because the needy groan,
PSA.12.5	I will now arise,” says the 
PSA.12.5	“I will place him in the safety for which he longs.”
PSA.12.6	The promises of the 
PSA.12.6	silver refined in a furnace on the ground,
PSA.12.6	purified seven times.
PSA.12.7	Do thou, O 
PSA.12.7	guard us ever from this generation.
PSA.12.8	On every side the wicked prowl,
PSA.12.8	as vileness is exalted among the sons of men.
PSA.13.1	How long, O 
PSA.13.1	How long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
PSA.13.2	How long must I bear pain
PSA.13.2	and have sorrow in my heart all the day?
PSA.13.2	How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?
PSA.13.3	Consider and answer me, O 
PSA.13.3	lighten my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;
PSA.13.4	lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed over him”;
PSA.13.4	lest my foes rejoice because I am shaken.
PSA.13.5	But I have trusted in thy steadfast love;
PSA.13.5	my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.
PSA.13.6	I will sing to the 
PSA.13.6	because he has dealt bountifully with me.
PSA.14.1	They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds,
PSA.14.1	there is none that does good.
PSA.14.2	The 
PSA.14.2	to see if there are any that act wisely,
PSA.14.2	that seek after God.
PSA.14.3	They have all gone astray, they are all alike corrupt;
PSA.14.3	there is none that does good,
PSA.14.3	no, not one.
PSA.14.4	Have they no knowledge, all the evildoers
PSA.14.4	who eat up my people as they eat bread,
PSA.14.4	and do not call upon the 
PSA.14.5	There they shall be in great terror,
PSA.14.5	for God is with the generation of the righteous.
PSA.14.6	You would confound the plans of the poor,
PSA.14.6	but the 
PSA.14.7	O that deliverance for Israel would come out of Zion!
PSA.14.7	When the 
PSA.14.7	Jacob shall rejoice, Israel shall be glad.
PSA.15.1	O 
PSA.15.1	Who shall dwell on thy holy hill?
PSA.15.2	He who walks blamelessly, and does what is right,
PSA.15.2	and speaks truth from his heart;
PSA.15.3	who does not slander with his tongue,
PSA.15.3	and does no evil to his friend,
PSA.15.3	nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor;
PSA.15.4	in whose eyes a reprobate is despised,
PSA.15.4	but who honors those who fear the 
PSA.15.4	who swears to his own hurt and does not change;
PSA.15.5	who does not put out his money at interest,
PSA.15.5	and does not take a bribe against the innocent.
PSA.15.5	He who does these things shall never be moved.
PSA.16.1	Preserve me, O God, for in thee I take refuge.
PSA.16.2	I say to the 
PSA.16.2	I have no good apart from thee.”
PSA.16.3	As for the saints in the land, they are the noble,
PSA.16.3	in whom is all my delight.
PSA.16.4	Those who choose another god multiply their sorrows;
PSA.16.4	their libations of blood I will not pour out
PSA.16.4	or take their names upon my lips.
PSA.16.5	The 
PSA.16.5	thou holdest my lot.
PSA.16.6	The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places;
PSA.16.6	yea, I have a goodly heritage.
PSA.16.7	I bless the 
PSA.16.7	in the night also my heart instructs me.
PSA.16.8	because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
PSA.16.9	Therefore my heart is glad, and my soul rejoices;
PSA.16.9	my body also dwells secure.
PSA.16.10	or let thy godly one see the Pit.
PSA.16.11	Thou dost show me the path of life;
PSA.16.11	in thy presence there is fulness of joy,
PSA.16.11	in thy right hand are pleasures for evermore.
PSA.17.1	Hear a just cause, O 
PSA.17.1	Give ear to my prayer from lips free of deceit!
PSA.17.2	From thee let my vindication come!
PSA.17.2	Let thy eyes see the right!
PSA.17.3	If thou triest my heart, if thou visitest me by night,
PSA.17.3	if thou testest me, thou wilt find no wickedness in me;
PSA.17.3	my mouth does not transgress.
PSA.17.4	With regard to the works of men, by the word of thy lips
PSA.17.4	I have avoided the ways of the violent.
PSA.17.5	My steps have held fast to thy paths,
PSA.17.5	my feet have not slipped.
PSA.17.6	I call upon thee, for thou wilt answer me, O God;
PSA.17.6	incline thy ear to me, hear my words.
PSA.17.7	Wondrously show thy steadfast love,
PSA.17.7	O savior of those who seek refuge
PSA.17.7	from their adversaries at thy right hand.
PSA.17.8	Keep me as the apple of the eye;
PSA.17.8	hide me in the shadow of thy wings,
PSA.17.9	from the wicked who despoil me,
PSA.17.9	my deadly enemies who surround me.
PSA.17.10	They close their hearts to pity;
PSA.17.10	with their mouths they speak arrogantly.
PSA.17.11	They track me down; now they surround me;
PSA.17.11	they set their eyes to cast me to the ground.
PSA.17.12	They are like a lion eager to tear,
PSA.17.12	as a young lion lurking in ambush.
PSA.17.13	Arise, O 
PSA.17.13	Deliver my life from the wicked by thy sword,
PSA.17.14	from men by thy hand, O 
PSA.17.14	from men whose portion in life is of the world.
PSA.17.14	May their belly be filled with what thou hast stored up for them;
PSA.17.14	may their children have more than enough;
PSA.17.14	may they leave something over to their babes.
PSA.17.15	As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness;
PSA.17.15	when I awake, I shall be satisfied with beholding thy form.
PSA.18.2	The 
PSA.18.2	my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge,
PSA.18.2	my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.
PSA.18.3	I call upon the 
PSA.18.3	and I am saved from my enemies.
PSA.18.4	The cords of death encompassed me,
PSA.18.4	the torrents of perdition assailed me;
PSA.18.5	the cords of Sheol entangled me,
PSA.18.5	the snares of death confronted me.
PSA.18.6	In my distress I called upon the 
PSA.18.6	to my God I cried for help.
PSA.18.6	From his temple he heard my voice,
PSA.18.6	and my cry to him reached his ears.
PSA.18.7	Then the earth reeled and rocked;
PSA.18.7	the foundations also of the mountains trembled
PSA.18.7	and quaked, because he was angry.
PSA.18.8	Smoke went up from his nostrils,
PSA.18.8	and devouring fire from his mouth;
PSA.18.8	glowing coals flamed forth from him.
PSA.18.9	He bowed the heavens, and came down;
PSA.18.9	thick darkness was under his feet.
PSA.18.10	He rode on a cherub, and flew;
PSA.18.10	he came swiftly upon the wings of the wind.
PSA.18.11	He made darkness his covering around him,
PSA.18.11	his canopy thick clouds dark with water.
PSA.18.12	Out of the brightness before him
PSA.18.12	there broke through his clouds
PSA.18.12	hailstones and coals of fire.
PSA.18.13	The 
PSA.18.13	and the Most High uttered his voice,
PSA.18.13	hailstones and coals of fire.
PSA.18.14	And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them;
PSA.18.14	he flashed forth lightnings, and routed them.
PSA.18.15	Then the channels of the sea were seen,
PSA.18.15	and the foundations of the world were laid bare,
PSA.18.15	at thy rebuke, O 
PSA.18.15	at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.
PSA.18.16	He reached from on high, he took me,
PSA.18.16	he drew me out of many waters.
PSA.18.17	He delivered me from my strong enemy,
PSA.18.17	and from those who hated me;
PSA.18.17	for they were too mighty for me.
PSA.18.18	They came upon me in the day of my calamity;
PSA.18.18	but the 
PSA.18.19	He brought me forth into a broad place;
PSA.18.19	he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
PSA.18.20	The 
PSA.18.20	according to the cleanness of my hands he recompensed me.
PSA.18.21	For I have kept the ways of the 
PSA.18.21	and have not wickedly departed from my God.
PSA.18.22	For all his ordinances were before me,
PSA.18.22	and his statutes I did not put away from me.
PSA.18.23	I was blameless before him,
PSA.18.23	and I kept myself from guilt.
PSA.18.24	Therefore the 
PSA.18.24	according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.
PSA.18.25	With the loyal thou dost show thyself loyal;
PSA.18.25	with the blameless man thou dost show thyself blameless;
PSA.18.26	with the pure thou dost show thyself pure;
PSA.18.26	and with the crooked thou dost show thyself perverse.
PSA.18.27	For thou dost deliver a humble people;
PSA.18.27	but the haughty eyes thou dost bring down.
PSA.18.28	Yea, thou dost light my lamp;
PSA.18.28	the 
PSA.18.29	Yea, by thee I can crush a troop;
PSA.18.29	and by my God I can leap over a wall.
PSA.18.30	This God—his way is perfect;
PSA.18.30	the promise of the 
PSA.18.30	he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him.
PSA.18.31	For who is God, but the 
PSA.18.31	And who is a rock, except our God?—
PSA.18.32	the God who girded me with strength,
PSA.18.32	and made my way safe.
PSA.18.33	He made my feet like hinds' feet,
PSA.18.33	and set me secure on the heights.
PSA.18.34	He trains my hands for war,
PSA.18.34	so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
PSA.18.35	Thou hast given me the shield of thy salvation,
PSA.18.35	and thy right hand supported me,
PSA.18.35	and thy help
PSA.18.36	Thou didst give a wide place for my steps under me,
PSA.18.36	and my feet did not slip.
PSA.18.37	I pursued my enemies and overtook them;
PSA.18.37	and did not turn back till they were consumed.
PSA.18.38	I thrust them through, so that they were not able to rise;
PSA.18.38	they fell under my feet.
PSA.18.39	For thou didst gird me with strength for the battle;
PSA.18.39	thou didst make my assailants sink under me.
PSA.18.40	Thou didst make my enemies turn their backs to me,
PSA.18.40	and those who hated me I destroyed.
PSA.18.41	They cried for help, but there was none to save,
PSA.18.41	they cried to the 
PSA.18.42	I beat them fine as dust before the wind;
PSA.18.42	I cast them out like the mire of the streets.
PSA.18.43	Thou didst deliver me from strife with the peoples;
PSA.18.43	thou didst make me the head of the nations;
PSA.18.43	people whom I had not known served me.
PSA.18.44	As soon as they heard of me they obeyed me;
PSA.18.44	foreigners came cringing to me.
PSA.18.45	Foreigners lost heart,
PSA.18.45	and came trembling out of their fastnesses.
PSA.18.46	The 
PSA.18.46	and exalted be the God of my salvation,
PSA.18.47	the God who gave me vengeance
PSA.18.47	and subdued peoples under me;
PSA.18.48	who delivered me from my enemies;
PSA.18.48	yea, thou didst exalt me above my adversaries;
PSA.18.48	thou didst deliver me from men of violence.
PSA.18.49	and sing praises to thy name.
PSA.18.50	Great triumphs he gives to his king,
PSA.18.50	and shows steadfast love to his anointed,
PSA.18.50	to David and his descendants for ever.
PSA.19.1	The heavens are telling the glory of God;
PSA.19.1	and the firmament proclaims his handiwork.
PSA.19.2	Day to day pours forth speech,
PSA.19.2	and night to night declares knowledge.
PSA.19.3	There is no speech, nor are there words;
PSA.19.3	their voice is not heard;
PSA.19.4	and their words to the end of the world.
PSA.19.4	In them he has set a tent for the sun,
PSA.19.5	which comes forth like a bridegroom leaving his chamber,
PSA.19.5	and like a strong man runs its course with joy.
PSA.19.6	Its rising is from the end of the heavens,
PSA.19.6	and its circuit to the end of them;
PSA.19.6	and there is nothing hid from its heat.
PSA.19.7	The law of the 
PSA.19.7	reviving the soul;
PSA.19.7	the testimony of the 
PSA.19.7	making wise the simple;
PSA.19.8	the precepts of the 
PSA.19.8	rejoicing the heart;
PSA.19.8	the commandment of the 
PSA.19.8	enlightening the eyes;
PSA.19.9	the fear of the 
PSA.19.9	enduring for ever;
PSA.19.9	the ordinances of the 
PSA.19.9	and righteous altogether.
PSA.19.10	More to be desired are they than gold,
PSA.19.10	even much fine gold;
PSA.19.10	sweeter also than honey
PSA.19.10	and drippings of the honeycomb.
PSA.19.11	Moreover by them is thy servant warned;
PSA.19.11	in keeping them there is great reward.
PSA.19.12	But who can discern his errors?
PSA.19.12	Clear thou me from hidden faults.
PSA.19.13	Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins;
PSA.19.13	let them not have dominion over me!
PSA.19.13	Then I shall be blameless,
PSA.19.13	and innocent of great transgression.
PSA.19.14	Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart
PSA.19.14	be acceptable in thy sight,
PSA.19.14	O 
PSA.20.1	The 
PSA.20.1	The name of the God of Jacob protect you!
PSA.20.2	May he send you help from the sanctuary,
PSA.20.2	and give you support from Zion!
PSA.20.3	May he remember all your offerings,
PSA.20.3	and regard with favor your burnt sacrifices! 
PSA.20.4	May he grant you your heart's desire,
PSA.20.4	and fulfil all your plans!
PSA.20.5	May we shout for joy over your victory,
PSA.20.5	and in the name of our God set up our banners!
PSA.20.5	May the 
PSA.20.6	Now I know that the 
PSA.20.6	he will answer him from his holy heaven
PSA.20.6	with mighty victories by his right hand.
PSA.20.7	Some boast of chariots, and some of horses;
PSA.20.7	but we boast of the name of the 
PSA.20.8	They will collapse and fall;
PSA.20.8	but we shall rise and stand upright.
PSA.20.9	Give victory to the king, O 
PSA.20.9	answer us when we call.
PSA.21.1	In thy strength the king rejoices, O 
PSA.21.1	and in thy help how greatly he exults!
PSA.21.2	Thou hast given him his heart's desire,
PSA.21.2	and hast not withheld the request of his lips. 
PSA.21.3	For thou dost meet him with goodly blessings;
PSA.21.3	thou dost set a crown of fine gold upon his head.
PSA.21.4	He asked life of thee; thou gavest it to him,
PSA.21.4	length of days for ever and ever.
PSA.21.5	His glory is great through thy help;
PSA.21.5	splendor and majesty thou dost bestow upon him.
PSA.21.6	Yea, thou dost make him most blessed for ever;
PSA.21.6	thou dost make him glad with the joy of thy presence.
PSA.21.7	For the king trusts in the 
PSA.21.7	and through the steadfast love of the Most High he shall not be moved.
PSA.21.8	Your hand will find out all your enemies;
PSA.21.8	your right hand will find out those who hate you.
PSA.21.9	You will make them as a blazing oven
PSA.21.9	when you appear.
PSA.21.9	The 
PSA.21.9	and fire will consume them.
PSA.21.10	You will destroy their offspring from the earth,
PSA.21.10	and their children from among the sons of men.
PSA.21.11	If they plan evil against you,
PSA.21.11	if they devise mischief, they will not succeed.
PSA.21.12	For you will put them to flight;
PSA.21.12	you will aim at their faces with your bows.
PSA.21.13	Be exalted, O 
PSA.21.13	We will sing and praise thy power.
PSA.22.1	Why art thou so far from helping me, from the words of my groaning?
PSA.22.2	O my God, I cry by day, but thou dost not answer;
PSA.22.2	and by night, but find no rest.
PSA.22.3	Yet thou art holy,
PSA.22.3	enthroned on the praises of Israel.
PSA.22.4	In thee our fathers trusted;
PSA.22.4	they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.
PSA.22.5	To thee they cried, and were saved;
PSA.22.5	in thee they trusted, and were not disappointed.
PSA.22.6	But I am a worm, and no man;
PSA.22.6	scorned by men, and despised by the people.
PSA.22.7	they make mouths at me, they wag their heads;
PSA.22.8	“He committed his cause to the 
PSA.22.8	let him rescue him, for he delights in him!”
PSA.22.9	Yet thou art he who took me from the womb;
PSA.22.9	thou didst keep me safe upon my mother's breasts.
PSA.22.10	Upon thee was I cast from my birth,
PSA.22.10	and since my mother bore me thou hast been my God.
PSA.22.11	Be not far from me,
PSA.22.11	for trouble is near
PSA.22.11	and there is none to help.
PSA.22.12	Many bulls encompass me,
PSA.22.12	strong bulls of Bashan surround me;
PSA.22.13	they open wide their mouths at me,
PSA.22.13	like a ravening and roaring lion.
PSA.22.14	I am poured out like water,
PSA.22.14	and all my bones are out of joint;
PSA.22.14	my heart is like wax,
PSA.22.14	it is melted within my breast;
PSA.22.15	my strength is dried up like a potsherd,
PSA.22.15	and my tongue cleaves to my jaws;
PSA.22.15	thou dost lay me in the dust of death.
PSA.22.16	Yea, dogs are round about me;
PSA.22.16	a company of evildoers encircle me;
PSA.22.16	they have pierced
PSA.22.17	I can count all my bones—
PSA.22.17	they stare and gloat over me;
PSA.22.18	and for my raiment they cast lots.
PSA.22.19	But thou, O 
PSA.22.19	O thou my help, hasten to my aid!
PSA.22.20	Deliver my soul from the sword,
PSA.22.20	my life
PSA.22.21	Save me from the mouth of the lion,
PSA.22.21	my afflicted soul
PSA.22.22	in the midst of the congregation I will praise thee:
PSA.22.23	You who fear the 
PSA.22.23	all you sons of Jacob, glorify him,
PSA.22.23	and stand in awe of him, all you sons of Israel!
PSA.22.24	For he has not despised or abhorred
PSA.22.24	the affliction of the afflicted;
PSA.22.24	and he has not hid his face from him,
PSA.22.24	but has heard, when he cried to him.
PSA.22.25	From thee comes my praise in the great congregation;
PSA.22.25	my vows I will pay before those who fear him.
PSA.22.26	The afflicted
PSA.22.26	those who seek him shall praise the 
PSA.22.26	May your hearts live for ever!
PSA.22.27	All the ends of the earth shall remember
PSA.22.27	and turn to the 
PSA.22.27	and all the families of the nations
PSA.22.27	shall worship before him.
PSA.22.28	For dominion belongs to the 
PSA.22.28	and he rules over the nations.
PSA.22.29	Yea, to him
PSA.22.29	before him shall bow all who go down to the dust,
PSA.22.29	and he who cannot keep himself alive.
PSA.22.30	Posterity shall serve him;
PSA.22.30	men shall tell of the Lord to the coming generation,
PSA.22.31	and proclaim his deliverance to a people yet unborn,
PSA.22.31	that he has wrought it.
PSA.23.1	The 
PSA.23.2	He leads me beside still waters;
PSA.23.3	he restores my soul.
PSA.23.3	He leads me in paths of righteousness
PSA.23.3	for his name's sake.
PSA.23.4	Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
PSA.23.4	I fear no evil;
PSA.23.4	for thou art with me;
PSA.23.4	thy rod and thy staff,
PSA.23.4	they comfort me.
PSA.23.5	Thou preparest a table before me
PSA.23.5	in the presence of my enemies;
PSA.23.5	thou anointest my head with oil,
PSA.23.5	my cup overflows.
PSA.23.6	Surely
PSA.23.6	all the days of my life;
PSA.23.6	and I shall dwell in the house of the 
PSA.23.6	for ever.
PSA.24.1	the world and those who dwell therein;
PSA.24.2	for he has founded it upon the seas,
PSA.24.2	and established it upon the rivers.
PSA.24.3	Who shall ascend the hill of the 
PSA.24.3	And who shall stand in his holy place?
PSA.24.4	who does not lift up his soul to what is false,
PSA.24.4	and does not swear deceitfully.
PSA.24.5	He will receive blessing from the 
PSA.24.5	and vindication from the God of his salvation.
PSA.24.6	Such is the generation of those who seek him,
PSA.24.6	who seek the face of the God of Jacob.
PSA.24.7	Lift up your heads, O gates!
PSA.24.7	and be lifted up, O ancient doors!
PSA.24.7	that the King of glory may come in.
PSA.24.8	Who is the King of glory?
PSA.24.8	The 
PSA.24.8	the 
PSA.24.9	Lift up your heads, O gates!
PSA.24.9	and be lifted up,
PSA.24.9	that the King of glory may come in.
PSA.24.10	Who is this King of glory?
PSA.24.10	The 
PSA.24.10	he is the King of glory! 
PSA.25.1	To thee, O 
PSA.25.2	O my God, in thee I trust,
PSA.25.2	let me not be put to shame;
PSA.25.2	let not my enemies exult over me.
PSA.25.3	Yea, let none that wait for thee be put to shame;
PSA.25.3	let them be ashamed who are wantonly treacherous.
PSA.25.4	Make me to know thy ways, O 
PSA.25.4	teach me thy paths.
PSA.25.5	Lead me in thy truth, and teach me,
PSA.25.5	for thou art the God of my salvation;
PSA.25.5	for thee I wait all the day long.
PSA.25.6	Be mindful of thy mercy, O 
PSA.25.6	for they have been from of old.
PSA.25.7	Remember not the sins of my youth, or my trangressions;
PSA.25.7	according to thy steadfast love remember me,
PSA.25.7	for thy goodness' sake, O 
PSA.25.8	Good and upright is the 
PSA.25.8	therefore he instructs sinners in the way.
PSA.25.9	He leads the humble in what is right,
PSA.25.9	and teaches the humble his way.
PSA.25.10	All the paths of the 
PSA.25.10	for those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.
PSA.25.11	For thy name's sake, O 
PSA.25.11	pardon my guilt, for it is great.
PSA.25.12	Who is the man that fears the 
PSA.25.12	Him will he instruct in the way that he should choose.
PSA.25.13	He himself shall abide in prosperity,
PSA.25.13	and his children shall possess the land.
PSA.25.14	The friendship of the 
PSA.25.14	and he makes known to them his covenant.
PSA.25.15	My eyes are ever toward the 
PSA.25.15	for he will pluck my feet out of the net.
PSA.25.16	Turn thou to me, and be gracious to me;
PSA.25.16	for I am lonely and afflicted.
PSA.25.17	Relieve the troubles of my heart,
PSA.25.17	and bring me
PSA.25.18	Consider my affliction and my trouble,
PSA.25.18	and forgive all my sins.
PSA.25.19	Consider how many are my foes,
PSA.25.19	and with what violent hatred they hate me.
PSA.25.20	Oh guard my life, and deliver me;
PSA.25.20	let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in thee.
PSA.25.21	May integrity and uprightness preserve me,
PSA.25.21	for I wait for thee.
PSA.25.22	Redeem Israel, O God,
PSA.25.22	out of all his troubles.
PSA.26.1	Vindicate me, O 
PSA.26.1	for I have walked in my integrity,
PSA.26.1	and I have trusted in the 
PSA.26.2	Prove me, O 
PSA.26.2	test my heart and my mind.
PSA.26.3	For thy steadfast love is before my eyes,
PSA.26.3	and I walk in faithfulness to thee.
PSA.26.4	I do not sit with false men,
PSA.26.4	nor do I consort with dissemblers;
PSA.26.5	I hate the company of evildoers,
PSA.26.5	and I will not sit with the wicked.
PSA.26.6	I wash my hands in innocence,
PSA.26.6	and go about thy altar, O 
PSA.26.7	singing aloud a song of thanksgiving,
PSA.26.7	and telling all thy wondrous deeds.
PSA.26.8	O 
PSA.26.8	and the place where thy glory dwells.
PSA.26.9	Sweep me not away with sinners,
PSA.26.9	nor my life with bloodthirsty men,
PSA.26.10	men in whose hands are evil devices,
PSA.26.10	and whose right hands are full of bribes.
PSA.26.11	But as for me, I walk in my integrity;
PSA.26.11	redeem me, and be gracious to me.
PSA.26.12	My foot stands on level ground;
PSA.26.12	in the great congregation I will bless the 
PSA.27.1	The 
PSA.27.1	whom shall I fear?
PSA.27.1	The 
PSA.27.1	of whom shall I be afraid?
PSA.27.2	When evildoers assail me,
PSA.27.2	uttering slanders against me,
PSA.27.2	my adversaries and foes,
PSA.27.2	they shall stumble and fall.
PSA.27.3	Though a host encamp against me,
PSA.27.3	my heart shall not fear;
PSA.27.3	though war arise against me,
PSA.27.3	yet I will be confident.
PSA.27.4	One thing have I asked of the 
PSA.27.4	that will I seek after;
PSA.27.4	that I may dwell in the house of the 
PSA.27.4	all the days of my life,
PSA.27.4	to behold the beauty of the 
PSA.27.4	and to inquire in his temple.
PSA.27.5	For he will hide me in his shelter
PSA.27.5	in the day of trouble;
PSA.27.5	he will conceal me under the cover of his tent,
PSA.27.5	he will set me high upon a rock.
PSA.27.6	And now my head shall be lifted up
PSA.27.6	above my enemies round about me;
PSA.27.6	and I will offer in his tent
PSA.27.6	sacrifices with shouts of joy;
PSA.27.6	I will sing and make melody to the 
PSA.27.7	Hear, O 
PSA.27.7	be gracious to me and answer me!
PSA.27.8	Thou hast said, “Seek ye my face.”
PSA.27.8	My heart says to thee,
PSA.27.8	“Thy face, 
PSA.27.9	Hide not thy face from me.
PSA.27.9	Turn not thy servant away in anger,
PSA.27.9	thou who hast been my help.
PSA.27.9	Cast me not off, forsake me not,
PSA.27.9	O God of my salvation!
PSA.27.10	For my father and my mother have forsaken me,
PSA.27.10	but the 
PSA.27.11	Teach me thy way, O 
PSA.27.11	and lead me on a level path
PSA.27.11	because of my enemies.
PSA.27.12	Give me not up to the will of my adversaries;
PSA.27.12	for false witnesses have risen against me,
PSA.27.12	and they breathe out violence.
PSA.27.13	I believe that I shall see the goodness of the 
PSA.27.13	in the land of the living!
PSA.27.14	Wait for the 
PSA.27.14	be strong, and let your heart take courage;
PSA.27.14	yea, wait for the 
PSA.28.1	To thee, O 
PSA.28.1	my rock, be not deaf to me,
PSA.28.1	lest, if thou be silent to me,
PSA.28.1	I become like those who go down to the Pit.
PSA.28.2	Hear the voice of my supplication,
PSA.28.2	as I cry to thee for help,
PSA.28.2	as I lift up my hands
PSA.28.2	towards thy most holy sanctuary.
PSA.28.3	Take me not off with the wicked,
PSA.28.3	with those who are workers of evil,
PSA.28.3	who speak peace with their neighbors,
PSA.28.3	while mischief is in their hearts.
PSA.28.4	Requite them according to their work,
PSA.28.4	and according to the evil of their deeds;
PSA.28.4	requite them according to the work of their hands;
PSA.28.4	render them their due reward.
PSA.28.5	Because they do not regard the works of the 
PSA.28.5	or the work of his hands,
PSA.28.5	he will break them down and build them up no more.
PSA.28.6	Blessed be the 
PSA.28.6	for he has heard the voice of my supplications.
PSA.28.7	The 
PSA.28.7	in him my heart trusts;
PSA.28.7	so I am helped, and my heart exults,
PSA.28.7	and with my song I give thanks to him.
PSA.28.8	The 
PSA.28.8	he is the saving refuge of his anointed.
PSA.28.9	O save thy people, and bless thy heritage;
PSA.28.9	be thou their shepherd, and carry them for ever.

PSA.30.1	and hast not let my foes rejoice over me.
PSA.30.2	O 
PSA.30.2	and thou hast healed me.
PSA.30.3	O 
PSA.30.3	restored me to life from among those gone down to the Pit.
PSA.30.4	Sing praises to the 
PSA.30.4	and give thanks to his holy name.
PSA.30.5	For his anger is but for a moment,
PSA.30.5	and his favor is for a lifetime.
PSA.30.5	Weeping may tarry for the night,
PSA.30.5	but joy comes with the morning.
PSA.30.6	As for me, I said in my prosperity,
PSA.30.6	“I shall never be moved.”
PSA.30.7	By thy favor, O 
PSA.30.7	thou hadst established me as a strong mountain;
PSA.30.7	thou didst hide thy face,
PSA.30.7	I was dismayed.
PSA.30.8	To thee, O 
PSA.30.8	and to the 
PSA.30.9	“What profit is there in my death,
PSA.30.9	if I go down to the Pit?
PSA.30.9	Will the dust praise thee?
PSA.30.9	Will it tell of thy faithfulness?
PSA.30.10	Hear, O 
PSA.30.10	O 
PSA.30.11	Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing;
PSA.30.11	thou hast loosed my sackcloth
PSA.30.11	and girded me with gladness,
PSA.30.12	that my soul
PSA.30.12	O 
PSA.31.1	In thee, O 
PSA.31.1	let me never be put to shame;
PSA.31.1	in thy righteousness deliver me!
PSA.31.2	Incline thy ear to me,
PSA.31.2	rescue me speedily!
PSA.31.2	Be thou a rock of refuge for me,
PSA.31.2	a strong fortress to save me!
PSA.31.3	Yea, thou art my rock and my fortress;
PSA.31.3	for thy name's sake lead me and guide me,
PSA.31.4	take me out of the net which is hidden for me,
PSA.31.4	for thou art my refuge.
PSA.31.5	thou hast redeemed me, O 
PSA.31.6	Thou hatest
PSA.31.6	but I trust in the 
PSA.31.7	I will rejoice and be glad for thy steadfast love,
PSA.31.7	because thou hast seen my affliction,
PSA.31.7	thou hast taken heed of my adversities,
PSA.31.8	and hast not delivered me into the hand of the enemy;
PSA.31.8	thou hast set my feet in a broad place.
PSA.31.9	Be gracious to me, O 
PSA.31.9	my eye is wasted from grief,
PSA.31.9	my soul and my body also.
PSA.31.10	For my life is spent with sorrow,
PSA.31.10	and my years with sighing;
PSA.31.10	my strength fails because of my misery,
PSA.31.10	and my bones waste away.
PSA.31.11	I am the scorn of all my adversaries,
PSA.31.11	a horror
PSA.31.11	an object of dread to my acquaintances;
PSA.31.11	those who see me in the street flee from me.
PSA.31.12	I have passed out of mind like one who is dead;
PSA.31.12	I have become like a broken vessel.
PSA.31.13	terror on every side!—
PSA.31.13	as they scheme together against me,
PSA.31.13	as they plot to take my life.
PSA.31.14	But I trust in thee, O 
PSA.31.14	I say, “Thou art my God.”
PSA.31.15	My times are in thy hand;
PSA.31.15	deliver me from the hand of my enemies and persecutors!
PSA.31.16	Let thy face shine on thy servant;
PSA.31.16	save me in thy steadfast love!
PSA.31.17	Let me not be put to shame, O 
PSA.31.17	for I call on thee;
PSA.31.17	let the wicked be put to shame,
PSA.31.17	let them go dumbfounded to Sheol.
PSA.31.18	Let the lying lips be dumb,
PSA.31.18	which speak insolently against the righteous
PSA.31.18	in pride and contempt.
PSA.31.19	O how abundant is thy goodness,
PSA.31.19	which thou hast laid up for those who fear thee,
PSA.31.19	and wrought for those who take refuge in thee,
PSA.31.19	in the sight of the sons of men!
PSA.31.20	In the covert of thy presence thou hidest them
PSA.31.20	from the plots of men;
PSA.31.20	thou holdest them safe under thy shelter
PSA.31.20	from the strife of tongues.
PSA.31.21	Blessed be the 
PSA.31.21	for he has wondrously shown his steadfast love to me
PSA.31.21	when I was beset as in a besieged city.
PSA.31.22	I had said in my alarm,
PSA.31.22	“I am driven far
PSA.31.22	But thou didst hear my supplications,
PSA.31.22	when I cried to thee for help.
PSA.31.23	Love the 
PSA.31.23	The 
PSA.31.23	but abundantly requites him who acts haughtily.
PSA.31.24	Be strong, and let your heart take courage,
PSA.31.24	all you who wait for the 
PSA.32.1	whose sin is covered.
PSA.32.2	Blessed is the man to whom the 
PSA.32.2	and in whose spirit there is no deceit.
PSA.32.3	When I declared not my sin, my body wasted away
PSA.32.3	through my groaning all day long.
PSA.32.4	For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me;
PSA.32.4	my strength was dried up
PSA.32.5	I acknowledged my sin to thee,
PSA.32.5	and I did not hide my iniquity;
PSA.32.5	I said, “I will confess my trangressions to the 
PSA.32.5	then thou didst forgive the guilt of my sin. 
PSA.32.6	Therefore let every one who is godly
PSA.32.6	offer prayer to thee;
PSA.32.6	at a time of distress,
PSA.32.6	they shall not reach him.
PSA.32.7	Thou art a hiding place for me,
PSA.32.7	thou preservest me from trouble;
PSA.32.7	thou dost encompass me with deliverance.
PSA.32.8	I will instruct you and teach you
PSA.32.8	the way you should go;
PSA.32.8	I will counsel you with my eye upon you.
PSA.32.9	Be not like a horse or a mule, without understanding,
PSA.32.9	which must be curbed with bit and bridle,
PSA.32.9	else it will not keep with you.
PSA.32.10	Many are the pangs of the wicked;
PSA.32.10	but steadfast love surrounds him who trusts in the 
PSA.32.11	Be glad in the 
PSA.32.11	and shout for joy, all you upright in heart!
PSA.33.1	Rejoice in the 
PSA.33.1	Praise befits the upright.
PSA.33.2	Praise the 
PSA.33.2	make melody to him with the harp of ten strings!
PSA.33.3	Sing to him a new song,
PSA.33.3	play skilfully on the strings, with loud shouts.
PSA.33.4	For the word of the 
PSA.33.4	and all his work is done in faithfulness.
PSA.33.5	He loves righteousness and justice;
PSA.33.5	the earth is full of the steadfast love of the 
PSA.33.6	By the word of the 
PSA.33.6	and all their host by the breath of his mouth.
PSA.33.7	He gathered the waters of the sea as in a bottle;
PSA.33.7	he put the deeps in storehouses.
PSA.33.8	Let all the earth fear the 
PSA.33.8	let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him!
PSA.33.9	For he spoke, and it came to be;
PSA.33.9	he commanded, and it stood forth.
PSA.33.10	The 
PSA.33.10	he frustrates the plans of the peoples.
PSA.33.11	The counsel of the 
PSA.33.11	the thoughts of his heart to all generations.
PSA.33.12	Blessed is the nation whose God is the 
PSA.33.12	the people whom he has chosen as his heritage!
PSA.33.13	The 
PSA.33.13	he sees all the sons of men;
PSA.33.14	from where he sits enthroned he looks forth
PSA.33.14	on all the inhabitants of the earth,
PSA.33.15	he who fashions the hearts of them all,
PSA.33.15	and observes all their deeds.
PSA.33.16	A king is not saved by his great army;
PSA.33.16	a warrior is not delivered by his great strength.
PSA.33.17	The war horse is a vain hope for victory,
PSA.33.17	and by its great might it cannot save.
PSA.33.18	Behold, the eye of the 
PSA.33.18	on those who hope in his steadfast love,
PSA.33.19	that he may deliver their soul from death,
PSA.33.19	and keep them alive in famine.
PSA.33.20	Our soul waits for the 
PSA.33.20	he is our help and shield.
PSA.33.21	Yea, our heart is glad in him,
PSA.33.21	because we trust in his holy name.
PSA.33.22	Let thy steadfast love, O 
PSA.33.22	even as we hope in thee.
PSA.34.1	I will bless the 
PSA.34.1	his praise shall continually be in my mouth.
PSA.34.2	My soul makes its boast in the 
PSA.34.2	let the afflicted hear and be glad.
PSA.34.3	O magnify the 
PSA.34.3	and let us exalt his name together!
PSA.34.4	I sought the 
PSA.34.4	and delivered me from all my fears.
PSA.34.5	Look to him, and be radiant;
PSA.34.5	so your
PSA.34.6	This poor man cried, and the 
PSA.34.6	and saved him out of all his troubles.
PSA.34.7	The angel of the 
PSA.34.7	around those who fear him, and delivers them.
PSA.34.8	Happy is the man who takes refuge in him!
PSA.34.9	O fear the 
PSA.34.9	for those who fear him have no want!
PSA.34.10	The young lions suffer want and hunger;
PSA.34.10	but those who seek the 
PSA.34.11	Come, O sons, listen to me,
PSA.34.11	I will teach you the fear of the 
PSA.34.12	and covets many days, that he may enjoy good?
PSA.34.13	Keep your tongue from evil,
PSA.34.13	and your lips from speaking deceit.
PSA.34.14	Depart from evil, and do good;
PSA.34.14	seek peace, and pursue it.
PSA.34.15	The eyes of the 
PSA.34.15	and his ears toward their cry.
PSA.34.16	The face of the 
PSA.34.16	to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.
PSA.34.17	When the righteous cry for help, the 
PSA.34.17	and delivers them out of all their troubles.
PSA.34.18	The 
PSA.34.18	and saves the crushed in spirit.
PSA.34.19	Many are the afflictions of the righteous;
PSA.34.19	but the 
PSA.34.20	He keeps all his bones;
PSA.34.20	not one of them is broken.
PSA.34.21	Evil shall slay the wicked;
PSA.34.21	and those who hate the righteous will be condemned.
PSA.34.22	The 
PSA.34.22	none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.
PSA.35.1	Contend, O 
PSA.35.1	fight against those who fight against me!
PSA.35.2	Take hold of shield and buckler,
PSA.35.2	and rise for my help!
PSA.35.3	Draw the spear and javelin
PSA.35.3	against my pursuers!
PSA.35.3	Say to my soul,
PSA.35.3	“I am your deliverance!”
PSA.35.4	Let them be put to shame and dishonor
PSA.35.4	who seek after my life!
PSA.35.4	Let them be turned back and confounded
PSA.35.4	who devise evil against me!
PSA.35.5	Let them be like chaff before the wind,
PSA.35.5	with the angel of the 
PSA.35.6	Let their way be dark and slippery,
PSA.35.6	with the angel of the 
PSA.35.7	For without cause they hid their net for me;
PSA.35.7	without cause they dug a pit
PSA.35.8	Let ruin come upon them unawares!
PSA.35.8	And let the net which they hid ensnare them;
PSA.35.8	let them fall therein to ruin!
PSA.35.9	Then my soul shall rejoice in the 
PSA.35.9	exulting in his deliverance.
PSA.35.10	All my bones shall say,
PSA.35.10	“O 
PSA.35.10	thou who deliverest the weak
PSA.35.10	from him who is too strong for him,
PSA.35.10	the weak and needy from him who despoils him?”
PSA.35.11	Malicious witnesses rise up;
PSA.35.11	they ask me of things that I know not.
PSA.35.12	They requite me evil for good;
PSA.35.12	my soul is forlorn.
PSA.35.13	But I, when they were sick—
PSA.35.13	I wore sackcloth,
PSA.35.13	I afflicted myself with fasting.
PSA.35.13	I prayed with head bowed
PSA.35.14	as though I grieved for my friend or my brother;
PSA.35.14	I went about as one who laments his mother,
PSA.35.14	bowed down and in mourning.
PSA.35.15	But at my stumbling they gathered in glee,
PSA.35.15	they gathered together against me;
PSA.35.15	cripples whom I knew not
PSA.35.15	slandered me without ceasing;
PSA.35.16	they impiously mocked more and more,
PSA.35.16	gnashing at me with their teeth.
PSA.35.17	How long, O 
PSA.35.17	Rescue me from their ravages,
PSA.35.17	my life from the lions!
PSA.35.18	Then I will thank thee in the great congregation;
PSA.35.18	in the mighty throng I will praise thee.
PSA.35.19	who are wrongfully my foes,
PSA.35.19	and let not those wink the eye
PSA.35.19	who hate me without cause.
PSA.35.20	For they do not speak peace,
PSA.35.20	but against those who are quiet in the land
PSA.35.20	they conceive words of deceit.
PSA.35.21	They open wide their mouths against me;
PSA.35.21	they say, “Aha, Aha!
PSA.35.21	our eyes have seen it!”
PSA.35.22	Thou hast seen, O 
PSA.35.22	O Lord, be not far from me!
PSA.35.23	Bestir thyself, and awake for my right,
PSA.35.23	for my cause, my God and my Lord!
PSA.35.24	Vindicate me, O 
PSA.35.24	and let them not rejoice over me!
PSA.35.25	Let them not say to themselves,
PSA.35.25	“Aha, we have our heart's desire!”
PSA.35.25	Let them not say, “We have swallowed him up.”
PSA.35.26	Let them be put to shame and confusion altogether
PSA.35.26	who rejoice at my calamity!
PSA.35.26	Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor
PSA.35.26	who magnify themselves against me!
PSA.35.27	Let those who desire my vindication
PSA.35.27	shout for joy and be glad,
PSA.35.27	and say evermore,
PSA.35.27	“Great is the 
PSA.35.27	who delights in the welfare of his servant!”
PSA.35.28	Then my tongue shall tell of thy righteousness
PSA.35.28	and of thy praise all the day long.
PSA.36.1	deep in his heart;
PSA.36.1	there is no fear of God
PSA.36.1	before his eyes.
PSA.36.2	For he flatters himself in his own eyes
PSA.36.2	that his iniquity cannot be found out and hated.
PSA.36.3	The words of his mouth are mischief and deceit;
PSA.36.3	he has ceased to act wisely and do good.
PSA.36.4	He plots mischief while on his bed;
PSA.36.4	he sets himself in a way that is not good;
PSA.36.4	he spurns not evil.
PSA.36.5	Thy steadfast love, O 
PSA.36.5	thy faithfulness to the clouds.
PSA.36.6	Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God,
PSA.36.6	thy judgments are like the great deep;
PSA.36.6	man and beast thou savest, O 
PSA.36.7	How precious is thy steadfast love, O God!
PSA.36.7	The children of men take refuge in the shadow of thy wings.
PSA.36.8	They feast on the abundance of thy house,
PSA.36.8	and thou givest them drink from the river of thy delights.
PSA.36.9	For with thee is the fountain of life;
PSA.36.9	in thy light do we see light.
PSA.36.10	O continue thy steadfast love to those who know thee,
PSA.36.10	and thy salvation to the upright of heart!
PSA.36.11	Let not the foot of arrogance come upon me,
PSA.36.11	nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.
PSA.36.12	There the evildoers lie prostrate,
PSA.36.12	they are thrust down, unable to rise.
PSA.37.1	Fret not yourself because of the wicked,
PSA.37.1	be not envious of wrongdoers!
PSA.37.2	For they will soon fade like the grass,
PSA.37.2	and wither like the green herb.
PSA.37.3	Trust in the 
PSA.37.3	so you will dwell in the land, and enjoy security.
PSA.37.4	Take delight in the 
PSA.37.4	and he will give you the desires of your heart.
PSA.37.5	Commit your way to the 
PSA.37.5	trust in him, and he will act.
PSA.37.6	He will bring forth your vindication as the light,
PSA.37.6	and your right as the noonday.
PSA.37.7	Be still before the 
PSA.37.7	fret not yourself over him who prospers in his way,
PSA.37.7	over the man who carries out evil devices!
PSA.37.8	Refrain from anger, and forsake wrath!
PSA.37.8	Fret not yourself; it tends only to evil.
PSA.37.9	For the wicked shall be cut off;
PSA.37.9	but those who wait for the 
PSA.37.10	Yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more;
PSA.37.10	though you look well at his place, he will not be there.
PSA.37.11	and delight themselves in abundant prosperity.
PSA.37.12	The wicked plots against the righteous,
PSA.37.12	and gnashes his teeth at him;
PSA.37.13	but the 
PSA.37.13	for he sees that his day is coming.
PSA.37.14	The wicked draw the sword and bend their bows,
PSA.37.14	to bring down the poor and needy,
PSA.37.14	to slay those who walk uprightly;
PSA.37.15	their sword shall enter their own heart,
PSA.37.15	and their bows shall be broken.
PSA.37.16	Better is a little that the righteous has
PSA.37.16	than the abundance of many wicked.
PSA.37.17	For the arms of the wicked shall be broken;
PSA.37.17	but the 
PSA.37.18	The 
PSA.37.18	and their heritage will abide for ever;
PSA.37.19	they are not put to shame in evil times,
PSA.37.19	in the days of famine they have abundance.
PSA.37.20	But the wicked perish;
PSA.37.20	the enemies of the 
PSA.37.20	they vanish—like smoke they vanish away.
PSA.37.21	The wicked borrows, and cannot pay back,
PSA.37.21	but the righteous is generous and gives;
PSA.37.22	for those blessed by the 
PSA.37.22	but those cursed by him shall be cut off.
PSA.37.23	The steps of a man are from the 
PSA.37.23	and he establishes him in whose way he delights;
PSA.37.24	though he fall, he shall not be cast headlong,
PSA.37.24	for the 
PSA.37.25	I have been young, and now am old;
PSA.37.25	yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken
PSA.37.25	or his children begging bread.
PSA.37.26	He is ever giving liberally and lending,
PSA.37.26	and his children become a blessing.
PSA.37.27	Depart from evil, and do good;
PSA.37.27	so shall you abide for ever.
PSA.37.28	For the 
PSA.37.28	he will not forsake his saints.
PSA.37.28	The righteous shall be preserved for ever,
PSA.37.28	but the children of the wicked shall be cut off.
PSA.37.29	The righteous shall possess the land,
PSA.37.29	and dwell upon it for ever.
PSA.37.30	The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom,
PSA.37.30	and his tongue speaks justice.
PSA.37.31	The law of his God is in his heart;
PSA.37.31	his steps do not slip.
PSA.37.32	The wicked watches the righteous,
PSA.37.32	and seeks to slay him.
PSA.37.33	The 
PSA.37.33	or let him be condemned when he is brought to trial.
PSA.37.34	Wait for the 
PSA.37.34	and he will exalt you to possess the land;
PSA.37.34	you will look on the destruction of the wicked.
PSA.37.35	I have seen a wicked man overbearing,
PSA.37.35	and towering like a cedar of Lebanon.
PSA.37.36	Again I
PSA.37.36	though I sought him, he could not be found.
PSA.37.37	Mark the blameless man, and behold the upright,
PSA.37.37	for there is posterity for the man of peace.
PSA.37.38	But transgressors shall be altogether destroyed;
PSA.37.38	the posterity of the wicked shall be cut off.
PSA.37.39	The salvation of the righteous is from the 
PSA.37.39	he is their refuge in the time of trouble.
PSA.37.40	The 
PSA.37.40	he delivers them from the wicked, and saves them,
PSA.37.40	because they take refuge in him.
PSA.38.1	O 
PSA.38.1	nor chasten me in thy wrath!
PSA.38.2	For thy arrows have sunk into me,
PSA.38.2	and thy hand has come down on me.
PSA.38.3	There is no soundness in my flesh
PSA.38.3	because of thy indignation;
PSA.38.3	there is no health in my bones
PSA.38.3	because of my sin.
PSA.38.4	For my iniquities have gone over my head;
PSA.38.4	they weigh like a burden too heavy for me.
PSA.38.5	My wounds grow foul and fester
PSA.38.5	because of my foolishness,
PSA.38.6	I am utterly bowed down and prostrate;
PSA.38.6	all the day I go about mourning.
PSA.38.7	For my loins are filled with burning,
PSA.38.7	and there is no soundness in my flesh.
PSA.38.8	I am utterly spent and crushed;
PSA.38.8	I groan because of the tumult of my heart.
PSA.38.9	Lord, all my longing is known to thee,
PSA.38.9	my sighing is not hidden from thee.
PSA.38.10	My heart throbs, my strength fails me;
PSA.38.10	and the light of my eyes—it also has gone from me.
PSA.38.11	My friends and companions stand aloof from my plague,
PSA.38.11	and my kinsmen stand afar off.
PSA.38.12	Those who seek my life lay their snares,
PSA.38.12	those who seek my hurt speak of ruin,
PSA.38.12	and meditate treachery all the day long.
PSA.38.13	But I am like a deaf man, I do not hear,
PSA.38.13	Like a dumb man who does not open his mouth.
PSA.38.14	Yea, I am like a man who does not hear,
PSA.38.14	and in whose mouth are no rebukes.
PSA.38.15	But for thee, O 
PSA.38.15	it is thou, O 
PSA.38.16	For I pray, “Only let them not rejoice over me,
PSA.38.16	who boast against me when my foot slips!”
PSA.38.17	For I am ready to fall,
PSA.38.17	and my pain is ever with me.
PSA.38.18	I confess my iniquity,
PSA.38.18	I am sorry for my sin.
PSA.38.19	Those who are my foes without cause
PSA.38.19	and many are those who hate me wrongfully.
PSA.38.20	Those who render me evil for good
PSA.38.20	are my adversaries because I follow after good.
PSA.38.21	Do not forsake me, O 
PSA.38.21	O my God, be not far from me!
PSA.38.22	Make haste to help me,
PSA.38.22	O Lord, my salvation!
PSA.39.1	I said, “I will guard my ways,
PSA.39.1	that I may not sin with my tongue;
PSA.39.1	I will bridle
PSA.39.1	so long as the wicked are in my presence.”
PSA.39.2	I was dumb and silent,
PSA.39.2	I held my peace to no avail;
PSA.39.2	my distress grew worse,
PSA.39.3	my heart became hot within me.
PSA.39.3	As I mused, the fire burned;
PSA.39.3	then I spoke with my tongue:
PSA.39.4	“
PSA.39.4	and what is the measure of my days;
PSA.39.4	let me know how fleeting my life is!
PSA.39.5	Behold, thou hast made my days a few handbreadths,
PSA.39.5	and my lifetime is as nothing in thy sight.
PSA.39.5	Surely every man stands as a mere breath! 
PSA.39.6	Surely man goes about as a shadow!
PSA.39.6	Surely for naught are they in turmoil;
PSA.39.6	man heaps up, and knows not who will gather!
PSA.39.7	“And now, Lord, for what do I wait?
PSA.39.7	My hope is in thee.
PSA.39.8	Deliver me from all my transgressions.
PSA.39.8	Make me not the scorn of the fool!
PSA.39.9	I am dumb, I do not open my mouth;
PSA.39.9	for it is thou who hast done it.
PSA.39.10	Remove thy stroke from me;
PSA.39.10	I am spent by the blows
PSA.39.11	When thou dost chasten man
PSA.39.11	with rebukes for sin,
PSA.39.11	thou dost consume like a moth what is dear to him;
PSA.39.11	surely every man is a mere breath! 
PSA.39.12	“Hear my prayer, O 
PSA.39.12	and give ear to my cry;
PSA.39.12	hold not thy peace at my tears!
PSA.39.12	For I am thy passing guest,
PSA.39.12	a sojourner, like all my fathers.
PSA.39.13	Look away from me, that I may know gladness,
PSA.39.13	before I depart and be no more!”
PSA.40.1	I waited patiently for the 
PSA.40.1	he inclined to me and heard my cry.
PSA.40.2	He drew me up from the desolate pit,
PSA.40.2	out of the miry bog,
PSA.40.2	and set my feet upon a rock,
PSA.40.2	making my steps secure.
PSA.40.3	He put a new song in my mouth,
PSA.40.3	a song of praise to our God.
PSA.40.3	Many will see and fear,
PSA.40.3	and put their trust in the 
PSA.40.4	Blessed is the man who makes
PSA.40.4	the 
PSA.40.4	who does not turn to the proud,
PSA.40.4	to those who go astray after false gods!
PSA.40.5	Thou hast multiplied, O 
PSA.40.5	thy wondrous deeds and thy thoughts toward us;
PSA.40.5	none can compare with thee!
PSA.40.5	Were I to proclaim and tell of them,
PSA.40.5	they would be more than can be numbered.
PSA.40.6	but thou hast given me an open ear.
PSA.40.6	Burnt offering and sin offering
PSA.40.6	thou hast not required.
PSA.40.7	Then I said, “Lo, I come;
PSA.40.7	in the roll of the book it is written of me;
PSA.40.8	I delight to do thy will, O my God;
PSA.40.8	thy law is within my heart.”
PSA.40.9	I have told the glad news of deliverance
PSA.40.9	in the great congregation;
PSA.40.9	lo, I have not restrained my lips,
PSA.40.9	as thou knowest, O 
PSA.40.10	I have not hid thy saving help within my heart,
PSA.40.10	I have spoken of thy faithfulness and thy salvation;
PSA.40.10	I have not concealed thy steadfast love and thy faithfulness
PSA.40.10	from the great congregation.
PSA.40.11	Do not thou, O 
PSA.40.11	thy mercy from me,
PSA.40.11	let thy steadfast love and thy faithfulness
PSA.40.11	ever preserve me!
PSA.40.12	For evils have encompassed me
PSA.40.12	without number;
PSA.40.12	my iniquities have overtaken me,
PSA.40.12	till I cannot see;
PSA.40.12	they are more than the hairs of my head;
PSA.40.12	my heart fails me.
PSA.40.13	O 
PSA.40.14	Let them be put to shame and confusion altogether
PSA.40.14	who seek to snatch away my life;
PSA.40.14	let them be turned back and brought to dishonor
PSA.40.14	who desire my hurt!
PSA.40.15	Let them be appalled because of their shame
PSA.40.15	who say to me, “Aha, Aha!”
PSA.40.16	But may all who seek thee
PSA.40.16	rejoice and be glad in thee;
PSA.40.16	may those who love thy salvation
PSA.40.16	say continually, “Great is the 
PSA.40.17	As for me, I am poor and needy;
PSA.40.17	but the Lord takes thought for me.
PSA.40.17	Thou art my help and my deliverer;
PSA.40.17	do not tarry, O my God!
PSA.41.1	Blessed is he who considers the poor!
PSA.41.1	The 
PSA.41.2	the 
PSA.41.2	he is called blessed in the land;
PSA.41.2	thou dost not give him up to the will of his enemies.
PSA.41.3	The 
PSA.41.3	in his illness thou healest all his infirmities.
PSA.41.4	As for me, I said, “O 
PSA.41.4	heal me, for I have sinned against thee!”
PSA.41.5	My enemies say of me in malice:
PSA.41.5	“When will he die, and his name perish?”
PSA.41.6	And when one comes to see me, he utters empty words,
PSA.41.6	while his heart gathers mischief;
PSA.41.6	when he goes out, he tells it abroad.
PSA.41.7	All who hate me whisper together about me;
PSA.41.7	they imagine the worst for me.
PSA.41.8	They say, “A deadly thing has fastened upon him;
PSA.41.8	he will not rise again from where he lies.”
PSA.41.9	who ate of my bread, has lifted his heel against me.
PSA.41.10	But do thou, O 
PSA.41.10	and raise me up, that I may requite them!
PSA.41.11	By this I know that thou art pleased with me,
PSA.41.11	in that my enemy has not triumphed over me.
PSA.41.12	But thou hast upheld me because of my integrity,
PSA.41.12	and set me in thy presence for ever.
PSA.41.13	Blessed be the 
PSA.41.13	from everlasting to everlasting!
PSA.41.13	Amen and Amen.
PSA.42.1	As a hart longs
PSA.42.1	for flowing streams,
PSA.42.1	so longs my soul
PSA.42.1	for thee, O God.
PSA.42.2	My soul thirsts for God,
PSA.42.2	for the living God.
PSA.42.2	When shall I come and behold
PSA.42.2	the face of God?
PSA.42.3	My tears have been my food
PSA.42.3	day and night,
PSA.42.3	while men say to me continually,
PSA.42.3	“Where is your God?”
PSA.42.4	These things I remember,
PSA.42.4	as I pour out my soul:
PSA.42.4	how I went with the throng,
PSA.42.4	and led them in procession to the house of God,
PSA.42.4	with glad shouts and songs of thanksgiving,
PSA.42.4	a multitude keeping festival.
PSA.42.5	Why are you cast down, O my soul,
PSA.42.5	and why are you disquieted within me?
PSA.42.5	Hope in God; for I shall again praise him,
PSA.42.5	my help 
PSA.42.6	and my God.
PSA.42.6	My soul is cast down within me,
PSA.42.6	therefore I remember thee
PSA.42.6	from the land of Jordan and of Hermon,
PSA.42.6	from Mount Mizar.
PSA.42.7	Deep calls to deep
PSA.42.7	at the thunder of thy cataracts;
PSA.42.7	all thy waves and thy billows
PSA.42.7	have gone over me.
PSA.42.8	By day the 
PSA.42.8	and at night his song is with me,
PSA.42.8	a prayer to the God of my life.
PSA.42.9	I say to God, my rock:
PSA.42.9	“Why hast thou forgotten me?
PSA.42.9	Why go I mourning
PSA.42.9	because of the oppression of the enemy?”
PSA.42.10	As with a deadly wound in my body,
PSA.42.10	my adversaries taunt me,
PSA.42.10	while they say to me continually,
PSA.42.10	“Where is your God?”
PSA.42.11	Why are you cast down, O my soul,
PSA.42.11	and why are you disquieted within me?
PSA.42.11	Hope in God; for I shall again praise him,
PSA.42.11	my help and my God.
PSA.43.1	Vindicate me, O God, and defend my cause
PSA.43.1	against an ungodly people;
PSA.43.1	from deceitful and unjust men
PSA.43.1	deliver me!
PSA.43.2	For thou art the God in whom I take refuge;
PSA.43.2	why hast thou cast me off?
PSA.43.2	Why go I mourning
PSA.43.2	because of the oppression of the enemy?
PSA.43.3	Oh send out thy light and thy truth;
PSA.43.3	let them lead me,
PSA.43.3	let them bring me to thy holy hill
PSA.43.3	and to thy dwelling!
PSA.43.4	Then I will go to the altar of God,
PSA.43.4	to God my exceeding joy;
PSA.43.4	and I will praise thee with the lyre,
PSA.43.4	O God, my God.
PSA.43.5	Why are you cast down, O my soul,
PSA.43.5	and why are you disquieted within me?
PSA.43.5	Hope in God; for I shall again praise him,
PSA.43.5	my help and my God.
PSA.44.1	We have heard with our ears, O God,
PSA.44.1	our fathers have told us,
PSA.44.1	what deeds thou didst perform in their days,
PSA.44.1	in the days of old:
PSA.44.2	thou with thy own hand didst drive out the nations,
PSA.44.2	but them thou didst plant;
PSA.44.2	thou didst afflict the peoples,
PSA.44.2	but them thou didst set free;
PSA.44.3	for not by their own sword did they win the land,
PSA.44.3	nor did their own arm give them victory;
PSA.44.3	but thy right hand, and thy arm,
PSA.44.3	and the light of thy countenance;
PSA.44.3	for thou didst delight in them.
PSA.44.4	Thou art my King and my God,
PSA.44.4	who ordainest
PSA.44.5	Through thee we push down our foes;
PSA.44.5	through thy name we tread down our assailants.
PSA.44.6	For not in my bow do I trust,
PSA.44.6	nor can my sword save me.
PSA.44.7	But thou hast saved us from our foes,
PSA.44.7	and hast put to confusion those who hate us.
PSA.44.8	In God we have boasted continually,
PSA.44.8	and we will give thanks to thy name for ever. 
PSA.44.9	Yet thou hast cast us off and abased us,
PSA.44.9	and hast not gone out with our armies.
PSA.44.10	Thou hast made us turn back from the foe;
PSA.44.10	and our enemies have gotten spoil.
PSA.44.11	Thou hast made us like sheep for slaughter,
PSA.44.11	and hast scattered us among the nations.
PSA.44.12	Thou hast sold thy people for a trifle,
PSA.44.12	demanding no high price for them.
PSA.44.13	Thou hast made us the taunt of our neighbors,
PSA.44.13	the derision and scorn of those about us.
PSA.44.14	Thou hast made us a byword among the nations,
PSA.44.14	a laughingstock
PSA.44.15	All day long my disgrace is before me,
PSA.44.15	and shame has covered my face,
PSA.44.16	at the words of the taunters and revilers,
PSA.44.16	at the sight of the enemy and the avenger.
PSA.44.17	All this has come upon us,
PSA.44.17	though we have not forgotten thee,
PSA.44.17	or been false to thy covenant.
PSA.44.18	Our heart has not turned back,
PSA.44.18	nor have our steps departed from thy way,
PSA.44.19	that thou shouldst have broken us in the place of jackals,
PSA.44.19	and covered us with deep darkness.
PSA.44.20	If we had forgotten the name of our God,
PSA.44.20	or spread forth our hands to a strange god,
PSA.44.21	would not God discover this?
PSA.44.21	For he knows the secrets of the heart.
PSA.44.22	and accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
PSA.44.23	Rouse thyself! Why sleepest thou, O Lord?
PSA.44.23	Awake! Do not cast us off for ever!
PSA.44.24	Why dost thou hide thy face?
PSA.44.24	Why dost thou forget our affliction and oppression?
PSA.44.25	For our soul is bowed down to the dust;
PSA.44.25	our body cleaves to the ground.
PSA.44.26	Rise up, come to our help!
PSA.44.26	Deliver us for the sake of thy steadfast love!
PSA.45.1	My heart overflows with a goodly theme;
PSA.45.1	I address my verses to the king;
PSA.45.1	my tongue is like the pen of a ready scribe.
PSA.45.2	You are the fairest of the sons of men;
PSA.45.2	grace is poured upon your lips;
PSA.45.2	therefore God has blessed you for ever.
PSA.45.3	Gird your sword upon your thigh, O mighty one,
PSA.45.3	in your glory and majesty!
PSA.45.4	In your majesty ride forth victoriously
PSA.45.4	for the cause of truth and to defend
PSA.45.4	let your right hand teach you dread deeds!
PSA.45.5	Your arrows are sharp
PSA.45.5	in the heart of the king's enemies;
PSA.45.5	the peoples fall under you.
PSA.45.6	Your royal scepter is a scepter of equity;
PSA.45.7	you love righteousness and hate wickedness.
PSA.45.7	Therefore God, your God, has anointed you
PSA.45.7	with the oil of gladness above your fellows;
PSA.45.8	your robes are all fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia.
PSA.45.8	From ivory palaces stringed instruments make you glad;
PSA.45.9	daughters of kings are among your ladies of honor;
PSA.45.9	at your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir.
PSA.45.10	Hear, O daughter, consider, and incline your ear;
PSA.45.10	forget your people and your father's house;
PSA.45.11	and the king will desire your beauty.
PSA.45.11	Since he is your lord, bow to him;
PSA.45.12	the people
PSA.45.12	the richest of the people 
PSA.45.13	with all kinds of wealth.
PSA.45.13	The princess is decked in her chamber with gold-woven robes;
PSA.45.14	in many-colored robes she is led to the king,
PSA.45.14	with her virgin companions, her escort,
PSA.45.15	With joy and gladness they are led along
PSA.45.15	as they enter the palace of the king.
PSA.45.16	Instead of your fathers shall be your sons;
PSA.45.16	you will make them princes in all the earth.
PSA.45.17	I will cause your name to be celebrated in all generations;
PSA.45.17	therefore the peoples will praise you for ever and ever.
PSA.46.1	God is our refuge and strength,
PSA.46.1	a very present
PSA.46.2	Therefore we will not fear though the earth should change,
PSA.46.2	though the mountains shake in the heart of the sea;
PSA.46.3	though its waters roar and foam,
PSA.46.3	though the mountains tremble with its tumult. 
PSA.46.4	There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,
PSA.46.4	the holy habitation of the Most High.
PSA.46.5	God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved;
PSA.46.5	God will help her right early.
PSA.46.6	The nations rage, the kingdoms totter;
PSA.46.6	he utters his voice, the earth melts.
PSA.46.7	The 
PSA.46.7	the God of Jacob is our refuge.
PSA.46.8	Come, behold the works of the 
PSA.46.8	how he has wrought desolations in the earth.
PSA.46.9	He makes wars cease to the end of the earth;
PSA.46.9	he breaks the bow, and shatters the spear,
PSA.46.9	he burns the chariots with fire!
PSA.46.10	“Be still, and know that I am God.
PSA.46.10	I am exalted among the nations,
PSA.46.10	I am exalted in the earth!”
PSA.46.11	The 
PSA.46.11	the God of Jacob is our refuge.
PSA.47.1	Clap your hands, all peoples!
PSA.47.1	Shout to God with loud songs of joy!
PSA.47.2	For the 
PSA.47.2	a great king over all the earth.
PSA.47.3	He subdued peoples under us,
PSA.47.3	and nations under our feet.
PSA.47.4	He chose our heritage for us,
PSA.47.4	the pride of Jacob whom he loves. 
PSA.47.5	God has gone up with a shout,
PSA.47.5	the 
PSA.47.6	Sing praises to God, sing praises!
PSA.47.6	Sing praises to our King, sing praises!
PSA.47.7	For God is the king of all the earth;
PSA.47.7	sing praises with a psalm!
PSA.47.8	God reigns over the nations;
PSA.47.8	God sits on his holy throne.
PSA.47.9	The princes of the peoples gather
PSA.47.9	as the people of the God of Abraham.
PSA.47.9	For the shields of the earth belong to God;
PSA.47.9	he is highly exalted!
PSA.48.1	Great is the 
PSA.48.1	in the city of our God!
PSA.48.1	His holy mountain, 
PSA.48.2	 beautiful in elevation,
PSA.48.2	is the joy of all the earth,
PSA.48.2	Mount Zion, in the far north,
PSA.48.2	the city of the great King.
PSA.48.3	Within her citadels God
PSA.48.3	has shown himself a sure defense.
PSA.48.4	For lo, the kings assembled,
PSA.48.4	they came on together.
PSA.48.5	As soon as they saw it, they were astounded,
PSA.48.5	they were in panic, they took to flight;
PSA.48.6	trembling took hold of them there,
PSA.48.6	anguish as of a woman in travail.
PSA.48.7	By the east wind thou didst shatter
PSA.48.7	the ships of Tarshish.
PSA.48.8	As we have heard, so have we seen
PSA.48.8	in the city of the 
PSA.48.8	in the city of our God,
PSA.48.8	which God establishes for ever. 
PSA.48.9	We have thought on thy steadfast love, O God,
PSA.48.9	in the midst of thy temple.
PSA.48.10	As thy name, O God,
PSA.48.10	so thy praise reaches to the ends of the earth.
PSA.48.10	Thy right hand is filled with victory;
PSA.48.11	let Mount Zion be glad!
PSA.48.11	Let the daughters of Judah rejoice
PSA.48.11	because of thy judgments!
PSA.48.12	Walk about Zion, go round about her,
PSA.48.12	number her towers,
PSA.48.13	consider well her ramparts,
PSA.48.13	go through her citadels;
PSA.48.13	that you may tell the next generation
PSA.48.14	that this is God,
PSA.48.14	our God for ever and ever.
PSA.48.14	He will be our guide for ever.
PSA.49.1	Hear this, all peoples!
PSA.49.1	Give ear, all inhabitants of the world,
PSA.49.2	both low and high,
PSA.49.2	rich and poor together!
PSA.49.3	My mouth shall speak wisdom;
PSA.49.3	the meditation of my heart shall be understanding.
PSA.49.4	I will incline my ear to a proverb;
PSA.49.4	I will solve my riddle to the music of the lyre.
PSA.49.5	Why should I fear in times of trouble,
PSA.49.5	when the iniquity of my persecutors surrounds me,
PSA.49.6	men who trust in their wealth
PSA.49.6	and boast of the abundance of their riches?
PSA.49.7	Truly no man can ransom himself,
PSA.49.7	or give to God the price of his life,
PSA.49.8	for the ransom of his
PSA.49.8	and can never suffice,
PSA.49.9	that he should continue to live on for ever,
PSA.49.9	and never see the Pit.
PSA.49.10	Yea, he shall see that even the wise die,
PSA.49.10	the fool and the stupid alike must perish
PSA.49.10	and leave their wealth to others.
PSA.49.11	Their graves
PSA.49.11	their dwelling places to all generations,
PSA.49.11	though they named lands their own.
PSA.49.12	Man cannot abide in his pomp,
PSA.49.12	he is like the beasts that perish.
PSA.49.13	This is the fate of those who have foolish confidence,
PSA.49.13	the end of those
PSA.49.14	Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol;
PSA.49.14	Death shall be their shepherd;
PSA.49.14	straight to the grave they descend,
PSA.49.14	and their form shall waste away;
PSA.49.14	Sheol shall be their home.
PSA.49.15	But God will ransom my soul from the power of Sheol,
PSA.49.15	for he will receive me. 
PSA.49.16	Be not afraid when one becomes rich,
PSA.49.16	when the glory
PSA.49.17	For when he dies he will carry nothing away;
PSA.49.17	his glory
PSA.49.18	Though, while he lives, he counts himself happy,
PSA.49.18	and though a man gets praise when he does well for himself,
PSA.49.19	he will go to the generation of his fathers,
PSA.49.19	who will never more see the light.
PSA.49.20	Man cannot abide in his pomp,
PSA.49.20	he is like the beasts that perish.
PSA.50.1	The Mighty One, God the 
PSA.50.1	speaks and summons the earth
PSA.50.1	from the rising of the sun to its setting.
PSA.50.2	Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,
PSA.50.2	God shines forth.
PSA.50.3	Our God comes, he does not keep silence,
PSA.50.3	before him is a devouring fire,
PSA.50.3	round about him a mighty tempest.
PSA.50.4	He calls to the heavens above
PSA.50.4	and to the earth, that he may judge his people:
PSA.50.5	“Gather to me my faithful ones,
PSA.50.5	who made a covenant with me by sacrifice!”
PSA.50.6	The heavens declare his righteousness,
PSA.50.6	for God himself is judge! 
PSA.50.7	“Hear, O my people, and I will speak,
PSA.50.7	O Israel, I will testify against you.
PSA.50.7	I am God, your God.
PSA.50.8	I do not reprove you for your sacrifices;
PSA.50.8	your burnt offerings are continually before me.
PSA.50.9	I will accept no bull from your house,
PSA.50.9	nor he-goat from your folds.
PSA.50.10	For every beast of the forest is mine,
PSA.50.10	the cattle on a thousand hills.
PSA.50.11	I know all the birds of the air,
PSA.50.11	and all that moves in the field is mine.
PSA.50.12	“If I were hungry, I would not tell you;
PSA.50.12	for the world and all that is in it is mine.
PSA.50.13	Do I eat the flesh of bulls,
PSA.50.13	or drink the blood of goats?
PSA.50.14	Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving,
PSA.50.14	and pay your vows to the Most High;
PSA.50.15	and call upon me in the day of trouble;
PSA.50.15	I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me.”
PSA.50.16	But to the wicked God says:
PSA.50.16	“What right have you to recite my statutes,
PSA.50.16	or take my covenant on your lips?
PSA.50.17	For you hate discipline,
PSA.50.17	and you cast my words behind you.
PSA.50.18	If you see a thief, you are a friend of his;
PSA.50.18	and you keep company with adulterers.
PSA.50.19	“You give your mouth free rein for evil,
PSA.50.19	and your tongue frames deceit.
PSA.50.20	You sit and speak against your brother;
PSA.50.20	you slander your own mother's son.
PSA.50.21	These things you have done and I have been silent;
PSA.50.21	you thought that I was one like yourself.
PSA.50.21	But now I rebuke you, and lay the charge before you.
PSA.50.22	“Mark this, then, you who forget God,
PSA.50.22	lest I rend, and there be none to deliver!
PSA.50.23	He who brings thanksgiving as his sacrifice honors me;
PSA.50.23	to him who orders his way aright
PSA.50.23	I will show the salvation of God!”
PSA.51.1	Have mercy on me, O God, according to thy steadfast love;
PSA.51.1	according to thy abundant mercy blot out my transgressions.
PSA.51.2	Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity,
PSA.51.2	and cleanse me from my sin!
PSA.51.3	For I know my transgressions,
PSA.51.3	and my sin is ever before me.
PSA.51.4	and done that which is evil in thy sight,
PSA.51.4	so that thou art justified in thy sentence
PSA.51.4	and blameless in thy judgment.
PSA.51.5	Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,
PSA.51.5	and in sin did my mother conceive me.
PSA.51.6	Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward being;
PSA.51.6	therefore teach me wisdom in my secret heart.
PSA.51.7	Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean;
PSA.51.7	wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
PSA.51.8	Fill
PSA.51.8	let the bones which thou hast broken rejoice.
PSA.51.9	Hide thy face from my sins,
PSA.51.9	and blot out all my iniquities.
PSA.51.10	Create in me a clean heart, O God,
PSA.51.10	and put a new and right
PSA.51.11	Cast me not away from thy presence,
PSA.51.11	and take not thy holy Spirit from me.
PSA.51.12	Restore to me the joy of thy salvation,
PSA.51.12	and uphold me with a willing spirit.
PSA.51.13	Then I will teach transgressors thy ways,
PSA.51.13	and sinners will return to thee.
PSA.51.14	Deliver me from bloodguiltiness,
PSA.51.14	thou God of my salvation,
PSA.51.14	and my tongue will sing aloud of thy deliverance.
PSA.51.15	O Lord, open thou my lips,
PSA.51.15	and my mouth shall show forth thy praise.
PSA.51.16	For thou hast no delight in sacrifice;
PSA.51.16	were I to give a burnt offering, thou wouldst not be pleased.
PSA.51.17	The sacrifice acceptable to God
PSA.51.17	a broken and contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
PSA.51.18	Do good to Zion in thy good pleasure;
PSA.51.18	rebuild the walls of Jerusalem,
PSA.51.19	then wilt thou delight in right sacrifices,
PSA.51.19	in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings;
PSA.51.19	then bulls will be offered on thy altar.
PSA.52.1	Why do you boast, O mighty man,
PSA.52.1	of mischief done against the godly?
PSA.52.1	All the day 
PSA.52.2	you are plotting destruction.
PSA.52.2	Your tongue is like a sharp razor,
PSA.52.2	you worker of treachery.
PSA.52.3	You love evil more than good,
PSA.52.3	and lying more than speaking the truth. 
PSA.52.4	You love all words that devour,
PSA.52.4	O deceitful tongue.
PSA.52.5	But God will break you down for ever;
PSA.52.5	he will snatch and tear you from your tent;
PSA.52.5	he will uproot you from the land of the living. 
PSA.52.6	The righteous shall see, and fear,
PSA.52.6	and shall laugh at him, saying,
PSA.52.7	“See the man who would not make
PSA.52.7	God his refuge,
PSA.52.7	but trusted in the abundance of his riches,
PSA.52.7	and sought refuge in his wealth!”
PSA.52.8	But I am like a green olive tree
PSA.52.8	in the house of God.
PSA.52.8	I trust in the steadfast love of God
PSA.52.8	for ever and ever.
PSA.52.9	I will thank thee for ever,
PSA.52.9	because thou hast done it.
PSA.52.9	I will proclaim
PSA.52.9	in the presence of the godly.
PSA.53.1	“There is no God.”
PSA.53.1	They are corrupt, doing abominable iniquity;
PSA.53.1	there is none that does good.
PSA.53.2	God looks down from heaven
PSA.53.2	upon the sons of men
PSA.53.2	to see if there are any that are wise,
PSA.53.2	that seek after God.
PSA.53.3	They have all fallen away;
PSA.53.3	they are all alike depraved;
PSA.53.3	there is none that does good,
PSA.53.3	no, not one.
PSA.53.4	Have those who work evil no understanding,
PSA.53.4	who eat up my people as they eat bread,
PSA.53.4	and do not call upon God?
PSA.53.5	There they are, in great terror,
PSA.53.5	in terror such as has not been!
PSA.53.5	For God will scatter the bones of the ungodly;
PSA.53.5	they will be put to shame,
PSA.53.6	O that deliverance for Israel would come from Zion!
PSA.53.6	When God restores the fortunes of his people,
PSA.53.6	Jacob will rejoice and Israel be glad.
PSA.54.1	Save me, O God, by thy name,
PSA.54.1	and vindicate me by thy might.
PSA.54.2	Hear my prayer, O God;
PSA.54.2	give ear to the words of my mouth.
PSA.54.3	For insolent men
PSA.54.3	ruthless men seek my life;
PSA.54.3	they do not set God before them. 
PSA.54.4	Behold, God is my helper;
PSA.54.4	the Lord is the upholder
PSA.54.5	He will requite my enemies with evil;
PSA.54.5	in thy faithfulness put an end to them.
PSA.54.6	With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to thee;
PSA.54.6	I will give thanks to thy name, O 
PSA.54.7	For thou hast delivered me from every trouble,
PSA.54.7	and my eye has looked in triumph on my enemies.
PSA.55.1	Give ear to my prayer, O God;
PSA.55.1	and hide not thyself from my supplication!
PSA.55.2	Attend to me, and answer me;
PSA.55.2	I am overcome by my trouble.
PSA.55.2	I am distraught 
PSA.55.3	by the noise of the enemy,
PSA.55.3	because of the oppression of the wicked.
PSA.55.3	For they bring
PSA.55.3	and in anger they cherish enmity against me.
PSA.55.4	My heart is in anguish within me,
PSA.55.4	the terrors of death have fallen upon me.
PSA.55.5	Fear and trembling come upon me,
PSA.55.5	and horror overwhelms me.
PSA.55.6	And I say, “O that I had wings like a dove!
PSA.55.6	I would fly away and be at rest;
PSA.55.7	yea, I would wander afar,
PSA.55.7	I would lodge in the wilderness, 
PSA.55.8	I would haste to find me a shelter
PSA.55.8	from the raging wind and tempest.”
PSA.55.9	Destroy their plans,
PSA.55.9	for I see violence and strife in the city.
PSA.55.10	Day and night they go around it
PSA.55.10	on its walls;
PSA.55.10	and mischief and trouble are within it,
PSA.55.11	ruin is in its midst;
PSA.55.11	oppression and fraud
PSA.55.11	do not depart from its market place.
PSA.55.12	It is not an enemy who taunts me—
PSA.55.12	then I could bear it;
PSA.55.12	it is not an adversary who deals insolently with me—
PSA.55.12	then I could hide from him.
PSA.55.13	But it is you, my equal,
PSA.55.13	my companion, my familiar friend.
PSA.55.14	We used to hold sweet converse together;
PSA.55.14	within God's house we walked in fellowship.
PSA.55.15	Let death
PSA.55.15	let them go down to Sheol alive;
PSA.55.15	let them go away in terror into their graves.
PSA.55.16	But I call upon God;
PSA.55.16	and the 
PSA.55.17	Evening and morning and at noon
PSA.55.17	I utter my complaint and moan,
PSA.55.17	and he will hear my voice.
PSA.55.18	He will deliver my soul in safety
PSA.55.18	from the battle that I wage,
PSA.55.18	for many are arrayed against me.
PSA.55.19	God will give ear, and humble them,
PSA.55.19	he who is enthroned from of old;
PSA.55.19	because they keep no law,
PSA.55.19	and do not fear God. 
PSA.55.20	My companion stretched out his hand against his friends,
PSA.55.20	he violated his covenant.
PSA.55.21	His speech was smoother than butter,
PSA.55.21	yet war was in his heart;
PSA.55.21	his words were softer than oil,
PSA.55.21	yet they were drawn swords.
PSA.55.22	and he will sustain you;
PSA.55.22	he will never permit
PSA.55.22	the righteous to be moved.
PSA.55.23	But thou, O God, wilt cast them down
PSA.55.23	into the lowest pit;
PSA.55.23	men of blood and treachery
PSA.55.23	shall not live out half their days.
PSA.55.23	But I will trust in thee.
PSA.56.1	Be gracious to me, O God,
PSA.56.1	for men trample upon me;
PSA.56.1	all day long foemen oppress me;
PSA.56.2	my enemies trample upon me all day long,
PSA.56.2	for many fight against me proudly.
PSA.56.3	When I am afraid,
PSA.56.3	I put my trust in thee.
PSA.56.4	In God, whose word I praise,
PSA.56.4	in God I trust without a fear.
PSA.56.4	What can flesh do to me?
PSA.56.5	All day long they seek to injure my cause;
PSA.56.5	all their thoughts are against me for evil.
PSA.56.6	They band themselves together, they lurk,
PSA.56.6	they watch my steps.
PSA.56.6	As they have waited for my life,
PSA.56.7	so recompense
PSA.56.7	in wrath cast down the peoples, O God!
PSA.56.8	Thou hast kept count of my tossings;
PSA.56.8	put thou my tears in thy bottle!
PSA.56.8	Are they not in thy book?
PSA.56.9	Then my enemies will be turned back
PSA.56.9	in the day when I call.
PSA.56.9	This I know, that
PSA.56.10	In God, whose word I praise,
PSA.56.10	in the 
PSA.56.11	in God I trust without a fear.
PSA.56.11	What can man do to me?
PSA.56.12	My vows to thee I must perform, O God;
PSA.56.12	I will render thank offerings to thee.
PSA.56.13	For thou hast delivered my soul from death,
PSA.56.13	yea, my feet from falling,
PSA.56.13	that I may walk before God
PSA.56.13	in the light of life.
PSA.57.1	Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me,
PSA.57.1	for in thee my soul takes refuge;
PSA.57.1	in the shadow of thy wings I will take refuge,
PSA.57.1	till the storms of destruction pass by.
PSA.57.2	I cry to God Most High,
PSA.57.2	to God who fulfils his purpose for me.
PSA.57.3	He will send from heaven and save me,
PSA.57.3	he will put to shame those who trample upon me. 
PSA.57.3	God will send forth his steadfast love and his faithfulness!
PSA.57.4	I lie in the midst of lions
PSA.57.4	that greedily devour
PSA.57.4	their teeth are spears and arrows,
PSA.57.4	their tongues sharp swords.
PSA.57.5	Be exalted, O God, above the heavens!
PSA.57.5	Let thy glory be over all the earth!
PSA.57.6	They set a net for my steps;
PSA.57.6	my soul was bowed down.
PSA.57.6	They dug a pit in my way,
PSA.57.6	but they have fallen into it themselves. 
PSA.57.7	my heart is steadfast!
PSA.57.7	I will sing and make melody!
PSA.57.8	Awake, my soul!
PSA.57.8	Awake, O harp and lyre!
PSA.57.8	I will awake the dawn!
PSA.57.9	I will give thanks to thee, O Lord, among the peoples;
PSA.57.9	I will sing praises to thee among the nations.
PSA.57.10	For thy steadfast love is great to the heavens,
PSA.57.10	thy faithfulness to the clouds.
PSA.57.11	Be exalted, O God, above the heavens!
PSA.57.11	Let thy glory be over all the earth!
PSA.58.1	Do you indeed decree what is right, you gods?
PSA.58.1	Do you judge the sons of men uprightly?
PSA.58.2	Nay, in your hearts you devise wrongs;
PSA.58.2	your hands deal out violence on earth.
PSA.58.3	The wicked go astray from the womb,
PSA.58.3	they err from their birth, speaking lies.
PSA.58.4	They have venom like the venom of a serpent,
PSA.58.4	like the deaf adder that stops its ear,
PSA.58.5	so that it does not hear the voice of charmers
PSA.58.5	or of the cunning enchanter.
PSA.58.6	O God, break the teeth in their mouths;
PSA.58.6	tear out the fangs of the young lions, O 
PSA.58.7	Let them vanish like water that runs away;
PSA.58.7	like grass let them be trodden down and wither.
PSA.58.8	Let them be like the snail which dissolves into slime,
PSA.58.8	like the untimely birth that never sees the sun.
PSA.58.9	Sooner than your pots can feel the heat of thorns,
PSA.58.9	whether green or ablaze, may he sweep them away!
PSA.58.10	The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance;
PSA.58.10	he will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked.
PSA.58.11	Men will say, “Surely there is a reward for the righteous;
PSA.58.11	surely there is a God who judges on earth.”
PSA.59.1	Deliver me from my enemies, O my God,
PSA.59.1	protect me from those who rise up against me,
PSA.59.2	deliver me from those who work evil,
PSA.59.2	and save me from bloodthirsty men.
PSA.59.3	For lo, they lie in wait for my life;
PSA.59.3	fierce men band themselves against me.
PSA.59.3	For no transgression or sin of mine, O 
PSA.59.4	for no fault of mine, they run and make ready.
PSA.59.4	Rouse thyself, come to my help, and see!
PSA.59.5	Thou, 
PSA.59.5	Awake to punish all the nations;
PSA.59.5	spare none of those who treacherously plot evil. 
PSA.59.6	Each evening they come back,
PSA.59.6	howling like dogs
PSA.59.6	and prowling about the city.
PSA.59.7	There they are, bellowing with their mouths,
PSA.59.7	and snarling with
PSA.59.7	for “Who,” they think, “will hear us?”
PSA.59.8	But thou, O 
PSA.59.8	thou dost hold all the nations in derision.
PSA.59.9	O my Strength, I will sing praises to thee;
PSA.59.9	for thou, O God, art my fortress.
PSA.59.10	My God in his steadfast love will meet me;
PSA.59.10	my God will let me look in triumph on my enemies.
PSA.59.11	Slay them not, lest my people forget;
PSA.59.11	make them totter by thy power, and bring them down,
PSA.59.11	O Lord, our shield!
PSA.59.12	For the sin of their mouths, the words of their lips,
PSA.59.12	let them be trapped in their pride.
PSA.59.12	For the cursing and lies which they utter,
PSA.59.13	consume them in wrath,
PSA.59.13	consume them till they are no more,
PSA.59.13	that men may know that God rules over Jacob
PSA.59.13	to the ends of the earth. 
PSA.59.14	Each evening they come back,
PSA.59.14	howling like dogs
PSA.59.14	and prowling about the city.
PSA.59.15	They roam about for food,
PSA.59.15	and growl if they do not get their fill.
PSA.59.16	But I will sing of thy might;
PSA.59.16	I will sing aloud of thy steadfast love in the morning.
PSA.59.16	For thou hast been to me a fortress
PSA.59.16	and a refuge in the day of my distress.
PSA.59.17	O my Strength, I will sing praises to thee,
PSA.59.17	for thou, O God, art my fortress,
PSA.59.17	the God who shows me steadfast love.
PSA.60.1	O God, thou hast rejected us, broken our defenses;
PSA.60.1	thou hast been angry; oh, restore us.
PSA.60.2	Thou hast made the land to quake, thou hast rent it open;
PSA.60.2	repair its breaches, for it totters.
PSA.60.3	Thou hast made thy people suffer hard things;
PSA.60.3	thou hast given us wine to drink that made us reel.
PSA.60.4	Thou hast set up a banner for those who fear thee,
PSA.60.4	to rally to it from the bow.
PSA.60.5	give victory by thy right hand and answer us!
PSA.60.6	God has spoken in his sanctuary:
PSA.60.6	“With exultation I will divide up Shechem
PSA.60.6	and portion out the Vale of Succoth.
PSA.60.7	Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine;
PSA.60.7	Ephraim is my helmet;
PSA.60.7	Judah is my scepter.
PSA.60.8	Moab is my washbasin;
PSA.60.8	upon Edom I cast my shoe;
PSA.60.8	over Philistia I shout in triumph.”
PSA.60.9	Who will bring me to the fortified city?
PSA.60.9	Who will lead me to Edom?
PSA.60.10	Hast thou not rejected us, O God?
PSA.60.10	Thou dost not go forth, O God, with our armies.
PSA.60.11	O grant us help against the foe,
PSA.60.11	for vain is the help of man!
PSA.60.12	With God we shall do valiantly;
PSA.60.12	it is he who will tread down our foes.
PSA.61.1	Hear my cry, O God,
PSA.61.1	listen to my prayer;
PSA.61.2	from the end of the earth I call to thee,
PSA.61.2	when my heart is faint.
PSA.61.2	Lead thou me
PSA.61.2	to the rock that is higher than I;
PSA.61.3	for thou art my refuge,
PSA.61.3	a strong tower against the enemy.
PSA.61.4	Let me dwell in thy tent for ever!
PSA.61.4	Oh to be safe under the shelter of thy wings! 
PSA.61.5	For thou, O God, hast heard my vows,
PSA.61.5	thou hast given me the heritage of those who fear thy name.
PSA.61.6	Prolong the life of the king;
PSA.61.6	may his years endure to all generations!
PSA.61.7	May he be enthroned for ever before God;
PSA.61.7	bid steadfast love and faithfulness watch over him!
PSA.61.8	So will I ever sing praises to thy name,
PSA.61.8	as I pay my vows day after day.
PSA.62.1	For God alone my soul waits in silence;
PSA.62.1	from him comes my salvation.
PSA.62.2	He only is my rock and my salvation,
PSA.62.2	my fortress; I shall not be greatly moved.
PSA.62.3	How long will you set upon a man
PSA.62.3	to shatter him, all of you,
PSA.62.3	like a leaning wall, a tottering fence?
PSA.62.4	They only plan to thrust him down from his eminence.
PSA.62.4	They take pleasure in falsehood.
PSA.62.4	They bless with their mouths,
PSA.62.4	but inwardly they curse. 
PSA.62.5	For God alone my soul waits in silence,
PSA.62.5	for my hope is from him.
PSA.62.6	He only is my rock and my salvation,
PSA.62.6	my fortress; I shall not be shaken.
PSA.62.7	On God rests my deliverance and my honor;
PSA.62.7	my mighty rock, my refuge is God.
PSA.62.8	Trust in him at all times, O people;
PSA.62.8	pour out your heart before him;
PSA.62.8	God is a refuge for us. 
PSA.62.9	Men of low estate are but a breath,
PSA.62.9	men of high estate are a delusion;
PSA.62.9	in the balances they go up;
PSA.62.9	they are together lighter than a breath.
PSA.62.10	Put no confidence in extortion,
PSA.62.10	set no vain hopes on robbery;
PSA.62.10	if riches increase, set not your heart on them.
PSA.62.11	Once God has spoken;
PSA.62.11	twice have I heard this:
PSA.62.11	that power belongs to God;
PSA.62.12	For thou dost requite a man
PSA.62.12	according to his work.
PSA.63.1	O God, thou art my God, I seek thee,
PSA.63.1	my soul thirsts for thee;
PSA.63.1	my flesh faints for thee,
PSA.63.1	as in a dry and weary land where no water is.
PSA.63.2	So I have looked upon thee in the sanctuary,
PSA.63.2	beholding thy power and glory.
PSA.63.3	Because thy steadfast love is better than life,
PSA.63.3	my lips will praise thee.
PSA.63.4	So I will bless thee as long as I live;
PSA.63.4	I will lift up my hands and call on thy name.
PSA.63.5	My soul is feasted as with marrow and fat,
PSA.63.5	and my mouth praises thee with joyful lips,
PSA.63.6	when I think of thee upon my bed,
PSA.63.6	and meditate on thee in the watches of the night;
PSA.63.7	for thou hast been my help,
PSA.63.7	and in the shadow of thy wings I sing for joy.
PSA.63.8	My soul clings to thee;
PSA.63.8	thy right hand upholds me.
PSA.63.9	But those who seek to destroy my life
PSA.63.9	shall go down into the depths of the earth;
PSA.63.10	they shall be given over to the power of the sword,
PSA.63.10	they shall be prey for jackals.
PSA.63.11	But the king shall rejoice in God;
PSA.63.11	all who swear by him shall glory;
PSA.63.11	for the mouths of liars will be stopped.
PSA.64.1	Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint;
PSA.64.1	preserve my life from dread of the enemy,
PSA.64.2	hide me from the secret plots of the wicked,
PSA.64.2	from the scheming of evildoers,
PSA.64.3	who whet their tongues like swords,
PSA.64.3	who aim bitter words like arrows,
PSA.64.4	shooting from ambush at the blameless,
PSA.64.4	shooting at him suddenly and without fear.
PSA.64.5	They hold fast to their evil purpose;
PSA.64.5	they talk of laying snares secretly,
PSA.64.5	thinking, “Who can see us?
PSA.64.6	Who can search out our crimes?
PSA.64.6	We have thought out a cunningly conceived plot.”
PSA.64.6	For the inward mind and heart of a man are deep!
PSA.64.7	But God will shoot his arrow at them;
PSA.64.7	they will be wounded suddenly.
PSA.64.8	Because of their tongue he will bring them to ruin;
PSA.64.8	all who see them will wag their heads.
PSA.64.9	Then all men will fear;
PSA.64.9	they will tell what God has wrought,
PSA.64.9	and ponder what he has done.
PSA.64.10	Let the righteous rejoice in the 
PSA.64.10	and take refuge in him!
PSA.64.10	Let all the upright in heart glory!
PSA.65.1	Praise is due to thee,
PSA.65.1	O God, in Zion;
PSA.65.1	and to thee shall vows be performed,
PSA.65.2	O thou who hearest prayer!
PSA.65.2	To thee shall all flesh come
PSA.65.3	on account of sins.
PSA.65.3	When our transgressions prevail over us,
PSA.65.3	thou dost forgive them.
PSA.65.4	Blessed is he whom thou dost choose and bring near,
PSA.65.4	to dwell in thy courts!
PSA.65.4	We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house,
PSA.65.4	thy holy temple!
PSA.65.5	By dread deeds thou dost answer us with deliverance,
PSA.65.5	O God of our salvation,
PSA.65.5	who art the hope of all the ends of the earth,
PSA.65.5	and of the farthest seas;
PSA.65.6	who by thy strength hast established the mountains,
PSA.65.6	being girded with might;
PSA.65.7	who dost still the roaring of the seas,
PSA.65.7	the roaring of their waves,
PSA.65.7	the tumult of the peoples;
PSA.65.8	so that those who dwell at earth's farthest bounds
PSA.65.8	are afraid at thy signs;
PSA.65.8	thou makest the outgoings of the morning and the evening
PSA.65.8	to shout for joy.
PSA.65.9	Thou visitest the earth and waterest it,
PSA.65.9	thou greatly enrichest it;
PSA.65.9	the river of God is full of water;
PSA.65.9	thou providest their grain,
PSA.65.9	for so thou hast prepared it.
PSA.65.10	Thou waterest its furrows abundantly,
PSA.65.10	settling its ridges,
PSA.65.10	softening it with showers,
PSA.65.10	and blessing its growth.
PSA.65.11	Thou crownest the year with thy bounty;
PSA.65.11	the tracks of thy chariot drip with fatness.
PSA.65.12	The pastures of the wilderness drip,
PSA.65.12	the hills gird themselves with joy,
PSA.65.13	the meadows clothe themselves with flocks,
PSA.65.13	the valleys deck themselves with grain,
PSA.65.13	they shout and sing together for joy.
PSA.66.1	Make a joyful noise to God, all the earth;
PSA.66.2	sing the glory of his name;
PSA.66.2	give to him glorious praise!
PSA.66.3	Say to God, “How terrible are thy deeds!
PSA.66.3	So great is thy power that thy enemies cringe before thee.
PSA.66.4	All the earth worships thee;
PSA.66.4	they sing praises to thee,
PSA.66.4	sing praises to thy name.” 
PSA.66.5	Come and see what God has done:
PSA.66.5	he is terrible in his deeds among men.
PSA.66.6	He turned the sea into dry land;
PSA.66.6	men passed through the river on foot.
PSA.66.6	There did we rejoice in him,
PSA.66.7	who rules by his might for ever,
PSA.66.7	whose eyes keep watch on the nations—
PSA.66.7	let not the rebellious exalt themselves. 
PSA.66.8	Bless our God, O peoples,
PSA.66.8	let the sound of his praise be heard,
PSA.66.9	who has kept us among the living,
PSA.66.9	and has not let our feet slip.
PSA.66.10	For thou, O God, hast tested us;
PSA.66.10	thou hast tried us as silver is tried.
PSA.66.11	Thou didst bring us into the net;
PSA.66.11	thou didst lay affliction on our loins;
PSA.66.12	thou didst let men ride over our heads;
PSA.66.12	we went through fire and through water;
PSA.66.12	yet thou hast brought us forth to a spacious place.
PSA.66.13	I will come into thy house with burnt offerings;
PSA.66.13	I will pay thee my vows,
PSA.66.14	that which my lips uttered
PSA.66.14	and my mouth promised when I was in trouble.
PSA.66.15	I will offer to thee burnt offerings of fatlings,
PSA.66.15	with the smoke of the sacrifice of rams;
PSA.66.15	I will make an offering of bulls and goats. 
PSA.66.16	Come and hear, all you who fear God,
PSA.66.16	and I will tell what he has done for me.
PSA.66.17	I cried aloud to him,
PSA.66.17	and he was extolled with my tongue.
PSA.66.18	If I had cherished iniquity in my heart,
PSA.66.18	the Lord would not have listened.
PSA.66.19	But truly God has listened;
PSA.66.19	he has given heed to the voice of my prayer.
PSA.66.20	Blessed be God,
PSA.66.20	because he has not rejected my prayer
PSA.66.20	or removed his steadfast love from me!
PSA.67.1	May God be gracious to us and bless us
PSA.67.1	and make his face to shine upon us, 
PSA.67.2	that thy way may be known upon earth,
PSA.67.2	thy saving power among all nations.
PSA.67.3	Let the peoples praise thee, O God;
PSA.67.3	let all the peoples praise thee!
PSA.67.4	Let the nations be glad and sing for joy,
PSA.67.4	for thou dost judge the peoples with equity
PSA.67.4	and guide the nations upon earth. 
PSA.67.5	Let the peoples praise thee, O God;
PSA.67.5	let all the peoples praise thee!
PSA.67.6	The earth has yielded its increase;
PSA.67.6	God, our God, has blessed us.
PSA.67.7	God has blessed us;
PSA.67.7	let all the ends of the earth fear him!
PSA.68.1	Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered;
PSA.68.1	let those who hate him flee before him!
PSA.68.2	As smoke is driven away, so drive them away;
PSA.68.2	as wax melts before fire,
PSA.68.2	let the wicked perish before God!
PSA.68.3	But let the righteous be joyful;
PSA.68.3	let them exult before God;
PSA.68.3	let them be jubilant with joy!
PSA.68.4	Sing to God, sing praises to his name;
PSA.68.4	lift up a song to him who rides upon the clouds;
PSA.68.4	his name is the 
PSA.68.5	Father of the fatherless and protector of widows
PSA.68.5	is God in his holy habitation.
PSA.68.6	God gives the desolate a home to dwell in;
PSA.68.6	he leads out the prisoners to prosperity;
PSA.68.6	but the rebellious dwell in a parched land.
PSA.68.7	O God, when thou didst go forth before thy people,
PSA.68.7	when thou didst march through the wilderness, 
PSA.68.8	the earth quaked, the heavens poured down rain,
PSA.68.8	at the presence of God;
PSA.68.8	yon Sinai quaked at the presence of God,
PSA.68.8	the God of Israel.
PSA.68.9	Rain in abundance, O God, thou didst shed abroad;
PSA.68.9	thou didst restore thy heritage as it languished;
PSA.68.10	thy flock found a dwelling in it;
PSA.68.10	in thy goodness, O God, thou didst provide for the needy.
PSA.68.11	The Lord gives the command;
PSA.68.11	great is the host of those who bore the tidings:
PSA.68.12	“The kings of the armies, they flee, they flee!”
PSA.68.12	The women at home divide the spoil,
PSA.68.13	though they stay among the sheepfolds—
PSA.68.13	the wings of a dove covered with silver,
PSA.68.13	its pinions with green gold.
PSA.68.14	When the Almighty scattered kings there,
PSA.68.14	snow fell on Zalmon.
PSA.68.15	O mighty mountain, mountain of Bashan;
PSA.68.15	O many-peaked mountain, mountain of Bashan!
PSA.68.16	Why look you with envy, O many-peaked mountain,
PSA.68.16	at the mount which God desired for his abode,
PSA.68.16	yea, where the 
PSA.68.17	With mighty chariotry, twice ten thousand,
PSA.68.17	thousands upon thousands,
PSA.68.17	the Lord came from Sinai into the holy place.
PSA.68.18	leading captives in thy train,
PSA.68.18	and receiving gifts among men,
PSA.68.18	even among the rebellious, that the 
PSA.68.19	Blessed be the Lord,
PSA.68.19	who daily bears us up;
PSA.68.19	God is our salvation. 
PSA.68.20	Our God is a God of salvation;
PSA.68.20	and to 
PSA.68.21	But God will shatter the heads of his enemies,
PSA.68.21	the hairy crown of him who walks in his guilty ways.
PSA.68.22	The Lord said,
PSA.68.22	“I will bring them back from Bashan,
PSA.68.22	I will bring them back from the depths of the sea,
PSA.68.23	that you may bathe
PSA.68.23	that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from the foe.”
PSA.68.24	Thy solemn processions are seen,
PSA.68.24	the processions of my God, my King, into the sanctuary—
PSA.68.25	the singers in front, the minstrels last,
PSA.68.25	between them maidens playing timbrels:
PSA.68.26	“Bless God in the great congregation,
PSA.68.26	the 
PSA.68.27	There is Benjamin, the least of them, in the lead,
PSA.68.27	the princes of Judah in their throng,
PSA.68.27	the princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.
PSA.68.28	Summon thy might, O God;
PSA.68.28	show thy strength, O God, thou who hast wrought for us.
PSA.68.29	Because of thy temple at Jerusalem
PSA.68.29	kings bear gifts to thee.
PSA.68.30	Rebuke the beasts that dwell among the reeds,
PSA.68.30	the herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples.
PSA.68.30	Trample
PSA.68.30	scatter the peoples who delight in war.
PSA.68.31	Let bronze be brought from Egypt;
PSA.68.31	let Ethiopia hasten to stretch out her hands to God.
PSA.68.32	Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth;
PSA.68.32	sing praises to the Lord, 
PSA.68.33	to him who rides in the heavens, the ancient heavens;
PSA.68.33	lo, he sends forth his voice, his mighty voice.
PSA.68.34	Ascribe power to God,
PSA.68.34	whose majesty is over Israel,
PSA.68.34	and his power is in the skies.
PSA.68.35	Terrible is God in his
PSA.68.35	the God of Israel,
PSA.68.35	he gives power and strength to his people.
PSA.68.35	Blessed be God!
PSA.69.1	Save me, O God!
PSA.69.1	For the waters have come up to my neck.
PSA.69.2	I sink in deep mire,
PSA.69.2	where there is no foothold;
PSA.69.2	I have come into deep waters,
PSA.69.2	and the flood sweeps over me.
PSA.69.3	I am weary with my crying;
PSA.69.3	my throat is parched.
PSA.69.3	My eyes grow dim
PSA.69.3	with waiting for my God.
PSA.69.4	are those who hate me without cause;
PSA.69.4	mighty are those who would destroy me,
PSA.69.4	those who attack me with lies.
PSA.69.4	What I did not steal
PSA.69.4	must I now restore?
PSA.69.5	O God, thou knowest my folly;
PSA.69.5	the wrongs I have done are not hidden from thee.
PSA.69.6	Let not those who hope in thee be put to shame through me,
PSA.69.6	O Lord 
PSA.69.6	let not those who seek thee be brought to dishonor through me,
PSA.69.6	O God of Israel.
PSA.69.7	For it is for thy sake that I have borne reproach,
PSA.69.7	that shame has covered my face.
PSA.69.8	I have become a stranger to my brethren,
PSA.69.8	an alien to my mother's sons.
PSA.69.9	and the insults of those who insult thee have fallen on me.
PSA.69.10	When I humbled
PSA.69.10	it became my reproach.
PSA.69.11	When I made sackcloth my clothing,
PSA.69.11	I became a byword to them.
PSA.69.12	I am the talk of those who sit in the gate,
PSA.69.12	and the drunkards make songs about me.
PSA.69.13	But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O 
PSA.69.13	At an acceptable time, O God,
PSA.69.13	in the abundance of thy steadfast love answer me.
PSA.69.13	With thy faithful help 
PSA.69.14	rescue me
PSA.69.14	from sinking in the mire;
PSA.69.14	let me be delivered from my enemies
PSA.69.14	and from the deep waters.
PSA.69.15	Let not the flood sweep over me,
PSA.69.15	or the deep swallow me up,
PSA.69.15	or the pit close its mouth over me.
PSA.69.16	Answer me, O 
PSA.69.16	according to thy abundant mercy, turn to me.
PSA.69.17	Hide not thy face from thy servant;
PSA.69.17	for I am in distress, make haste to answer me.
PSA.69.18	Draw near to me, redeem me,
PSA.69.18	set me free because of my enemies!
PSA.69.19	Thou knowest my reproach,
PSA.69.19	and my shame and my dishonor;
PSA.69.19	my foes are all known to thee.
PSA.69.20	Insults have broken my heart,
PSA.69.20	so that I am in despair.
PSA.69.20	I looked for pity, but there was none;
PSA.69.20	and for comforters, but I found none.
PSA.69.21	and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
PSA.69.22	let their sacrificial feasts
PSA.69.23	Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see;
PSA.69.23	and make their loins tremble continually.
PSA.69.24	and let thy burning anger overtake them.
PSA.69.25	let no one dwell in their tents.
PSA.69.26	For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten,
PSA.69.26	and him
PSA.69.27	Add to them punishment upon punishment;
PSA.69.27	may they have no acquittal from thee.
PSA.69.28	let them not be enrolled among the righteous.
PSA.69.29	But I am afflicted and in pain;
PSA.69.29	let thy salvation, O God, set me on high!
PSA.69.30	I will praise the name of God with a song;
PSA.69.30	I will magnify him with thanksgiving.
PSA.69.31	This will please the 
PSA.69.31	or a bull with horns and hoofs.
PSA.69.32	Let the oppressed see it and be glad;
PSA.69.32	you who seek God, let your hearts revive.
PSA.69.33	For the 
PSA.69.33	and does not despise his own that are in bonds.
PSA.69.34	Let heaven and earth praise him,
PSA.69.34	the seas and everything that moves therein.
PSA.69.35	For God will save Zion
PSA.69.35	and rebuild the cities of Judah;
PSA.69.35	and his servants shall dwell
PSA.69.36	the children of his servants shall inherit it,
PSA.69.36	and those who love his name shall dwell in it.
PSA.70.1	O 
PSA.70.2	Let them be put to shame and confusion
PSA.70.2	who seek my life!
PSA.70.2	Let them be turned back and brought to dishonor
PSA.70.2	who desire my hurt!
PSA.70.3	Let them be appalled because of their shame
PSA.70.3	who say, “Aha, Aha!”
PSA.70.4	May all who seek thee
PSA.70.4	rejoice and be glad in thee!
PSA.70.4	May those who love thy salvation
PSA.70.4	say evermore, “God is great!”
PSA.70.5	But I am poor and needy;
PSA.70.5	hasten to me, O God!
PSA.70.5	Thou art my help and my deliverer;
PSA.70.5	O 
PSA.71.1	In thee, O 
PSA.71.1	let me never be put to shame!
PSA.71.2	In thy righteousness deliver me and rescue me;
PSA.71.2	incline thy ear to me, and save me!
PSA.71.3	Be thou to me a rock of refuge,
PSA.71.3	a strong fortress,
PSA.71.3	for thou art my rock and my fortress.
PSA.71.4	Rescue me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked,
PSA.71.4	from the grasp of the unjust and cruel man.
PSA.71.5	For thou, O Lord, art my hope,
PSA.71.5	my trust, O 
PSA.71.6	Upon thee I have leaned from my birth;
PSA.71.6	thou art he who took me from my mother's womb.
PSA.71.6	My praise is continually of thee.
PSA.71.7	I have been as a portent to many;
PSA.71.7	but thou art my strong refuge.
PSA.71.8	My mouth is filled with thy praise,
PSA.71.8	and with thy glory all the day.
PSA.71.9	Do not cast me off in the time of old age;
PSA.71.9	forsake me not when my strength is spent.
PSA.71.10	For my enemies speak concerning me,
PSA.71.10	those who watch for my life consult together,
PSA.71.11	and say, “God has forsaken him;
PSA.71.11	pursue and seize him,
PSA.71.11	for there is none to deliver him.”
PSA.71.12	O God, be not far from me;
PSA.71.12	O my God, make haste to help me!
PSA.71.13	May my accusers be put to shame and consumed;
PSA.71.13	with scorn and disgrace may they be covered
PSA.71.13	who seek my hurt.
PSA.71.14	But I will hope continually,
PSA.71.14	and will praise thee yet more and more.
PSA.71.15	My mouth will tell of thy righteous acts,
PSA.71.15	of thy deeds of salvation all the day,
PSA.71.15	for their number is past my knowledge.
PSA.71.16	With the mighty deeds of the Lord 
PSA.71.16	I will praise thy righteousness, thine alone.
PSA.71.17	O God, from my youth thou hast taught me,
PSA.71.17	and I still proclaim thy wondrous deeds.
PSA.71.18	So even to old age and gray hairs,
PSA.71.18	O God, do not forsake me,
PSA.71.18	till I proclaim thy might
PSA.71.18	to all the generations to come.
PSA.71.18	Thy power 
PSA.71.19	and thy righteousness, O God,
PSA.71.19	reach the high heavens.
PSA.71.19	Thou who hast done great things,
PSA.71.19	O God, who is like thee?
PSA.71.20	Thou who hast made me see many sore troubles
PSA.71.20	wilt revive me again;
PSA.71.20	from the depths of the earth
PSA.71.20	thou wilt bring me up again.
PSA.71.21	Thou wilt increase my honor,
PSA.71.21	and comfort me again.
PSA.71.22	I will also praise thee with the harp
PSA.71.22	for thy faithfulness, O my God;
PSA.71.22	I will sing praises to thee with the lyre,
PSA.71.22	O Holy One of Israel.
PSA.71.23	My lips will shout for joy,
PSA.71.23	when I sing praises to thee;
PSA.71.23	my soul also, which thou hast rescued.
PSA.71.24	And my tongue will talk of thy righteous help
PSA.71.24	all the day long,
PSA.71.24	for they have been put to shame and disgraced
PSA.71.24	who sought to do me hurt.
PSA.72.1	Give the king thy justice, O God,
PSA.72.1	and thy righteousness to the royal son!
PSA.72.2	May he judge thy people with righteousness,
PSA.72.2	and thy poor with justice!
PSA.72.3	Let the mountains bear prosperity for the people,
PSA.72.3	and the hills, in righteousness!
PSA.72.4	May he defend the cause of the poor of the people,
PSA.72.4	give deliverance to the needy,
PSA.72.4	and crush the oppressor!
PSA.72.5	May he live
PSA.72.5	and as long as the moon, throughout all generations!
PSA.72.6	May he be like rain that falls on the mown grass,
PSA.72.6	like showers that water the earth!
PSA.72.7	In his days may righteousness flourish,
PSA.72.7	and peace abound, till the moon be no more!
PSA.72.8	May he have dominion from sea to sea,
PSA.72.8	and from the River to the ends of the earth!
PSA.72.9	May his foes
PSA.72.9	and his enemies lick the dust!
PSA.72.10	May the kings of Tarshish and of the isles
PSA.72.10	render him tribute,
PSA.72.10	may the kings of Sheba and Seba bring gifts!
PSA.72.11	May all kings fall down before him,
PSA.72.11	all nations serve him!
PSA.72.12	For he delivers the needy when he calls,
PSA.72.12	the poor and him who has no helper.
PSA.72.13	He has pity on the weak and the needy,
PSA.72.13	and saves the lives of the needy.
PSA.72.14	From oppression and violence he redeems their life;
PSA.72.14	and precious is their blood in his sight.
PSA.72.15	Long may he live,
PSA.72.15	may gold of Sheba be given to him!
PSA.72.15	May prayer be made for him continually,
PSA.72.15	and blessings invoked for him all the day!
PSA.72.16	May there be abundance of grain in the land;
PSA.72.16	on the tops of the mountains may it wave;
PSA.72.16	may its fruit be like Lebanon;
PSA.72.16	and may men blossom forth from the cities
PSA.72.16	like the grass of the field!
PSA.72.17	May his name endure for ever,
PSA.72.17	his fame continue as long as the sun!
PSA.72.17	May men bless themselves by him,
PSA.72.17	all nations call him blessed!
PSA.72.18	Blessed be the 
PSA.72.18	who alone does wondrous things.
PSA.72.19	Blessed be his glorious name for ever;
PSA.72.19	may his glory fill the whole earth!
PSA.72.19	Amen and Amen!
PSA.72.20	The prayers of David, the son of Jesse, are ended.
PSA.73.1	Truly God is good to the upright,
PSA.73.1	to those who are pure in heart.
PSA.73.2	But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled,
PSA.73.2	my steps had well nigh slipped.
PSA.73.3	For I was envious of the arrogant,
PSA.73.3	when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
PSA.73.4	For they have no pangs;
PSA.73.4	their bodies are sound and sleek.
PSA.73.5	They are not in trouble as other men are;
PSA.73.5	they are not stricken like other men.
PSA.73.6	Therefore pride is their necklace;
PSA.73.6	violence covers them as a garment.
PSA.73.7	Their eyes swell out with fatness,
PSA.73.7	their hearts overflow with follies.
PSA.73.8	They scoff and speak with malice;
PSA.73.8	loftily they threaten oppression.
PSA.73.9	They set their mouths against the heavens,
PSA.73.9	and their tongue struts through the earth.
PSA.73.10	Therefore the people turn and praise them;
PSA.73.10	and find no fault in them.
PSA.73.11	And they say, “How can God know?
PSA.73.11	Is there knowledge in the Most High?”
PSA.73.12	Behold, these are the wicked;
PSA.73.12	always at ease, they increase in riches.
PSA.73.13	All in vain have I kept my heart clean
PSA.73.13	and washed my hands in innocence.
PSA.73.14	For all the day long I have been stricken,
PSA.73.14	and chastened every morning.
PSA.73.15	If I had said, “I will speak thus,”
PSA.73.15	I would have been untrue to the generation of thy children.
PSA.73.16	But when I thought how to understand this,
PSA.73.16	it seemed to me a wearisome task,
PSA.73.17	until I went into the sanctuary of God;
PSA.73.17	then I perceived their end.
PSA.73.18	Truly thou dost set them in slippery places;
PSA.73.18	thou dost make them fall to ruin.
PSA.73.19	How they are destroyed in a moment,
PSA.73.19	swept away utterly by terrors!
PSA.73.20	They are
PSA.73.20	on awaking you despise their phantoms.
PSA.73.21	When my soul was embittered,
PSA.73.21	when I was pricked in heart,
PSA.73.22	I was stupid and ignorant,
PSA.73.22	I was like a beast toward thee.
PSA.73.23	Nevertheless I am continually with thee;
PSA.73.23	thou dost hold my right hand.
PSA.73.24	Thou dost guide me with thy counsel,
PSA.73.24	and afterward thou wilt receive me to glory.
PSA.73.25	Whom have I in heaven but thee?
PSA.73.25	And there is nothing upon earth that I desire besides thee.
PSA.73.26	My flesh and my heart may fail,
PSA.73.26	but God is the strength
PSA.73.27	For lo, those who are far from thee shall perish;
PSA.73.27	thou dost put an end to those who are false to thee.
PSA.73.28	But for me it is good to be near God;
PSA.73.28	I have made the Lord 
PSA.73.28	that I may tell of all thy works.
PSA.74.1	O God, why dost thou cast us off for ever?
PSA.74.1	Why does thy anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?
PSA.74.2	Remember thy congregation, which thou hast gotten of old,
PSA.74.2	which thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of thy heritage!
PSA.74.2	Remember Mount Zion, where thou hast dwelt.
PSA.74.3	Direct thy steps to the perpetual ruins;
PSA.74.3	the enemy has destroyed everything in the sanctuary!
PSA.74.4	Thy foes have roared in the midst of thy holy place;
PSA.74.4	they set up their own signs for signs.
PSA.74.5	At the upper entrance they hacked
PSA.74.5	the wooden trellis with axes.
PSA.74.6	And then all its carved wood
PSA.74.6	they broke down with hatchets and hammers.
PSA.74.7	They set thy sanctuary on fire;
PSA.74.7	to the ground they desecrated the dwelling place of thy name.
PSA.74.8	They said to themselves, “We will utterly subdue them”;
PSA.74.8	they burned all the meeting places of God in the land.
PSA.74.9	We do not see our signs;
PSA.74.9	there is no longer any prophet,
PSA.74.9	and there is none among us who knows how long.
PSA.74.10	How long, O God, is the foe to scoff?
PSA.74.10	Is the enemy to revile thy name for ever?
PSA.74.11	Why dost thou hold back thy hand,
PSA.74.11	why dost thou keep thy right hand in
PSA.74.12	Yet God my King is from of old,
PSA.74.12	working salvation in the midst of the earth.
PSA.74.13	Thou didst divide the sea by thy might;
PSA.74.13	thou didst break the heads of the dragons on the waters.
PSA.74.14	Thou didst crush the heads of Leviathan,
PSA.74.14	thou didst give him as food
PSA.74.15	Thou didst cleave open springs and brooks;
PSA.74.15	thou didst dry up ever-flowing streams.
PSA.74.16	Thine is the day, thine also the night;
PSA.74.16	thou hast established the luminaries and the sun.
PSA.74.17	Thou hast fixed all the bounds of the earth;
PSA.74.17	thou hast made summer and winter.
PSA.74.18	Remember this, O 
PSA.74.18	and an impious people reviles thy name.
PSA.74.19	Do not deliver the soul of thy dove to the wild beasts;
PSA.74.19	do not forget the life of thy poor for ever.
PSA.74.20	Have regard for thy
PSA.74.20	for the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence.
PSA.74.21	Let not the downtrodden be put to shame;
PSA.74.21	let the poor and needy praise thy name.
PSA.74.22	Arise, O God, plead thy cause;
PSA.74.22	remember how the impious scoff at thee all the day!
PSA.74.23	Do not forget the clamor of thy foes,
PSA.74.23	the uproar of thy adversaries which goes up continually!
PSA.75.1	We give thanks to thee, O God; we give thanks;
PSA.75.1	we call on thy name and recount
PSA.75.2	At the set time which I appoint
PSA.75.2	I will judge with equity.
PSA.75.3	When the earth totters, and all its inhabitants,
PSA.75.3	it is I who keep steady its pillars. 
PSA.75.4	I say to the boastful, “Do not boast,”
PSA.75.4	and to the wicked, “Do not lift up your horn;
PSA.75.5	do not lift up your horn on high,
PSA.75.5	or speak with insolent neck.”
PSA.75.6	For not from the east or from the west
PSA.75.6	and not from the wilderness comes lifting up;
PSA.75.7	but it is God who executes judgment,
PSA.75.7	putting down one and lifting up another.
PSA.75.8	For in the hand of the 
PSA.75.8	with foaming wine, well mixed;
PSA.75.8	and he will pour a draught from it,
PSA.75.8	and all the wicked of the earth
PSA.75.8	shall drain it down to the dregs.
PSA.75.9	But I will rejoice
PSA.75.9	I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
PSA.75.10	All the horns of the wicked he
PSA.75.10	but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
PSA.76.1	In Judah God is known,
PSA.76.1	his name is great in Israel.
PSA.76.2	His abode has been established in Salem,
PSA.76.2	his dwelling place in Zion.
PSA.76.3	There he broke the flashing arrows,
PSA.76.3	the shield, the sword, and the weapons of war. 
PSA.76.4	Glorious art thou, more majestic
PSA.76.4	than the everlasting mountains.
PSA.76.5	The stouthearted were stripped of their spoil;
PSA.76.5	they sank into sleep;
PSA.76.5	all the men of war
PSA.76.5	were unable to use their hands.
PSA.76.6	At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob,
PSA.76.6	both rider and horse lay stunned.
PSA.76.7	But thou, terrible art thou!
PSA.76.7	Who can stand before thee
PSA.76.7	when once thy anger is roused?
PSA.76.8	From the heavens thou didst utter judgment;
PSA.76.8	the earth feared and was still,
PSA.76.9	when God arose to establish judgment
PSA.76.9	to save all the oppressed of the earth. 
PSA.76.10	Surely the wrath of men shall praise thee;
PSA.76.10	the residue of wrath thou wilt gird upon thee.
PSA.76.11	Make your vows to the 
PSA.76.11	let all around him bring gifts
PSA.76.11	to him who is to be feared,
PSA.76.12	who cuts off the spirit of princes,
PSA.76.12	who is terrible to the kings of the earth.
PSA.77.1	I cry aloud to God,
PSA.77.1	aloud to God, that he may hear me.
PSA.77.2	In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord;
PSA.77.2	in the night my hand is stretched out without wearying;
PSA.77.2	my soul refuses to be comforted.
PSA.77.3	I think of God, and I moan;
PSA.77.3	I meditate, and my spirit faints. 
PSA.77.4	Thou dost hold my eyelids from closing;
PSA.77.4	I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
PSA.77.5	I consider the days of old,
PSA.77.5	I remember the years long ago.
PSA.77.6	I commune
PSA.77.6	I meditate and search my spirit:
PSA.77.7	“Will the Lord spurn for ever,
PSA.77.7	and never again be favorable?
PSA.77.8	Has his steadfast love for ever ceased?
PSA.77.8	Are his promises at an end for all time?
PSA.77.9	Has God forgotten to be gracious?
PSA.77.9	Has he in anger shut up his compassion?” 
PSA.77.10	And I say, “It is my grief
PSA.77.10	that the right hand of the Most High has changed.”
PSA.77.11	I will call to mind the deeds of the 
PSA.77.11	yea, I will remember thy wonders of old.
PSA.77.12	I will meditate on all thy work,
PSA.77.12	and muse on thy mighty deeds.
PSA.77.13	Thy way, O God, is holy.
PSA.77.13	What god is great like our God?
PSA.77.14	Thou art the God who workest wonders,
PSA.77.14	who hast manifested thy might among the peoples.
PSA.77.15	Thou didst with thy arm redeem thy people,
PSA.77.15	the sons of Jacob and Joseph. 
PSA.77.16	When the waters saw thee, O God,
PSA.77.16	when the waters saw thee, they were afraid,
PSA.77.16	yea, the deep trembled.
PSA.77.17	The clouds poured out water;
PSA.77.17	the skies gave forth thunder;
PSA.77.17	thy arrows flashed on every side.
PSA.77.18	The crash of thy thunder was in the whirlwind;
PSA.77.18	thy lightnings lighted up the world;
PSA.77.18	the earth trembled and shook.
PSA.77.19	Thy way was through the sea,
PSA.77.19	thy path through the great waters;
PSA.77.19	yet thy footprints were unseen.
PSA.77.20	Thou didst lead thy people like a flock
PSA.77.20	by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
PSA.78.1	Give ear, O my people, to my teaching;
PSA.78.1	incline your ears to the words of my mouth!
PSA.78.2	I will utter dark sayings from of old,
PSA.78.3	things that we have heard and known,
PSA.78.3	that our fathers have told us.
PSA.78.4	We will not hide them from their children,
PSA.78.4	but tell to the coming generation
PSA.78.4	the glorious deeds of the 
PSA.78.4	and the wonders which he has wrought.
PSA.78.5	He established a testimony in Jacob,
PSA.78.5	and appointed a law in Israel,
PSA.78.5	which he commanded our fathers
PSA.78.5	to teach to their children;
PSA.78.6	that the next generation might know them,
PSA.78.6	the children yet unborn,
PSA.78.6	and arise and tell them to their children,
PSA.78.7	so that they should set their hope in God,
PSA.78.7	and not forget the works of God,
PSA.78.7	but keep his commandments;
PSA.78.8	and that they should not be like their fathers,
PSA.78.8	a stubborn and rebellious generation,
PSA.78.8	a generation whose heart was not steadfast,
PSA.78.8	whose spirit was not faithful to God.
PSA.78.9	The Ephraimites, armed with
PSA.78.9	turned back on the day of battle.
PSA.78.10	They did not keep God's covenant,
PSA.78.10	but refused to walk according to his law.
PSA.78.11	They forgot what he had done,
PSA.78.11	and the miracles that he had shown them.
PSA.78.12	In the sight of their fathers he wrought marvels
PSA.78.12	in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan.
PSA.78.13	He divided the sea and let them pass through it,
PSA.78.13	and made the waters stand like a heap.
PSA.78.14	In the daytime he led them with a cloud,
PSA.78.14	and all the night with a fiery light.
PSA.78.15	He cleft rocks in the wilderness,
PSA.78.15	and gave them drink abundantly as from the deep.
PSA.78.16	He made streams come out of the rock,
PSA.78.16	and caused waters to flow down like rivers.
PSA.78.17	Yet they sinned still more against him,
PSA.78.17	rebelling against the Most High in the desert.
PSA.78.18	They tested God in their heart
PSA.78.18	by demanding the food they craved.
PSA.78.19	They spoke against God, saying,
PSA.78.19	“Can God spread a table in the wilderness?
PSA.78.20	He smote the rock so that water gushed out
PSA.78.20	and streams overflowed.
PSA.78.20	Can he also give bread,
PSA.78.20	or provide meat for his people?”
PSA.78.21	Therefore, when the 
PSA.78.21	a fire was kindled against Jacob,
PSA.78.21	his anger mounted against Israel;
PSA.78.22	because they had no faith in God,
PSA.78.22	and did not trust his saving power.
PSA.78.23	Yet he commanded the skies above,
PSA.78.23	and opened the doors of heaven;
PSA.78.24	and gave them the grain of heaven.
PSA.78.25	Man ate of the bread of the angels;
PSA.78.25	he sent them food in abundance.
PSA.78.26	He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens,
PSA.78.26	and by his power he led out the south wind;
PSA.78.27	he rained flesh upon them like dust,
PSA.78.27	winged birds like the sand of the seas;
PSA.78.28	he let them fall in the midst of their camp,
PSA.78.28	all around their habitations.
PSA.78.29	And they ate and were well filled,
PSA.78.29	for he gave them what they craved.
PSA.78.30	But before they had sated their craving,
PSA.78.30	while the food was still in their mouths,
PSA.78.31	the anger of God rose against them
PSA.78.31	and he slew the strongest of them,
PSA.78.31	and laid low the picked men of Israel.
PSA.78.32	In spite of all this they still sinned;
PSA.78.32	despite his wonders they did not believe.
PSA.78.33	So he made their days vanish like a breath,
PSA.78.33	and their years in terror.
PSA.78.34	When he slew them, they sought for him;
PSA.78.34	they repented and sought God earnestly.
PSA.78.35	They remembered that God was their rock,
PSA.78.35	the Most High God their redeemer.
PSA.78.36	But they flattered him with their mouths;
PSA.78.36	they lied to him with their tongues.
PSA.78.37	they were not true to his covenant.
PSA.78.38	Yet he, being compassionate,
PSA.78.38	forgave their iniquity,
PSA.78.38	and did not destroy them;
PSA.78.38	he restrained his anger often,
PSA.78.38	and did not stir up all his wrath.
PSA.78.39	He remembered that they were but flesh,
PSA.78.39	a wind that passes and comes not again.
PSA.78.40	How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness
PSA.78.40	and grieved him in the desert!
PSA.78.41	They tested him again and again,
PSA.78.41	and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.78.42	They did not keep in mind his power,
PSA.78.42	or the day when he redeemed them from the foe;
PSA.78.43	when he wrought his signs in Egypt,
PSA.78.43	and his miracles in the fields of Zoan.
PSA.78.44	He turned their rivers to blood,
PSA.78.44	so that they could not drink of their streams.
PSA.78.45	He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them,
PSA.78.45	and frogs, which destroyed them.
PSA.78.46	He gave their crops to the caterpillar,
PSA.78.46	and the fruit of their labor to the locust.
PSA.78.47	He destroyed their vines with hail,
PSA.78.47	and their sycamores with frost.
PSA.78.48	He gave over their cattle to the hail,
PSA.78.48	and their flocks to thunderbolts.
PSA.78.49	He let loose on them his fierce anger,
PSA.78.49	wrath, indignation, and distress,
PSA.78.49	a company of destroying angels.
PSA.78.50	He made a path for his anger;
PSA.78.50	he did not spare them from death,
PSA.78.50	but gave their lives over to the plague.
PSA.78.51	He smote all the first-born in Egypt,
PSA.78.51	the first issue of their strength in the tents of Ham.
PSA.78.52	Then he led forth his people like sheep,
PSA.78.52	and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
PSA.78.53	He led them in safety, so that they were not afraid;
PSA.78.53	but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
PSA.78.54	And he brought them to his holy land,
PSA.78.54	to the mountain which his right hand had won.
PSA.78.55	He drove out nations before them;
PSA.78.55	he apportioned them for a possession
PSA.78.55	and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.
PSA.78.56	Yet they tested and rebelled against the Most High God,
PSA.78.56	and did not observe his testimonies,
PSA.78.57	but turned away and acted treacherously like their fathers;
PSA.78.57	they twisted like a deceitful bow.
PSA.78.58	For they provoked him to anger with their high places;
PSA.78.58	they moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
PSA.78.59	When God heard, he was full of wrath,
PSA.78.59	and he utterly rejected Israel.
PSA.78.60	He forsook his dwelling at Shiloh,
PSA.78.60	the tent where he dwelt among men,
PSA.78.61	and delivered his power to captivity,
PSA.78.61	his glory to the hand of the foe.
PSA.78.62	He gave his people over to the sword,
PSA.78.62	and vented his wrath on his heritage.
PSA.78.63	Fire devoured their young men,
PSA.78.63	and their maidens had no marriage song.
PSA.78.64	Their priests fell by the sword,
PSA.78.64	and their widows made no lamentation.
PSA.78.65	Then the Lord awoke as from sleep,
PSA.78.65	like a strong man shouting because of wine.
PSA.78.66	And he put his adversaries to rout;
PSA.78.66	he put them to everlasting shame.
PSA.78.67	He rejected the tent of Joseph,
PSA.78.67	he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;
PSA.78.68	but he chose the tribe of Judah,
PSA.78.68	Mount Zion, which he loves.
PSA.78.69	He built his sanctuary like the high heavens,
PSA.78.69	like the earth, which he has founded for ever.
PSA.78.70	He chose David his servant,
PSA.78.70	and took him from the sheepfolds;
PSA.78.71	from tending the ewes that had young he brought him
PSA.78.71	to be the shepherd of Jacob his people,
PSA.78.71	of Israel his inheritance.
PSA.78.72	With upright heart he tended them,
PSA.78.72	and guided them with skilful hand.
PSA.79.1	O God, the heathen have come into thy inheritance;
PSA.79.1	they have defiled thy holy temple;
PSA.79.1	they have laid Jerusalem in ruins.
PSA.79.2	They have given the bodies of thy servants
PSA.79.2	to the birds of the air for food,
PSA.79.2	the flesh of thy saints to the beasts of the earth.
PSA.79.3	They have poured out their blood like water
PSA.79.3	round about Jerusalem,
PSA.79.3	and there was none to bury them.
PSA.79.4	We have become a taunt to our neighbors,
PSA.79.4	mocked and derided by those round about us.
PSA.79.5	How long, O 
PSA.79.5	Will thy jealous wrath burn like fire?
PSA.79.6	Pour out thy anger on the nations
PSA.79.6	that do not know thee,
PSA.79.6	and on the kingdoms
PSA.79.6	that do not call on thy name!
PSA.79.7	For they have devoured Jacob,
PSA.79.7	and laid waste his habitation.
PSA.79.8	Do not remember against us the iniquities of our forefathers;
PSA.79.8	let thy compassion come speedily to meet us,
PSA.79.8	for we are brought very low.
PSA.79.9	Help us, O God of our salvation,
PSA.79.9	for the glory of thy name;
PSA.79.9	deliver us, and forgive our sins,
PSA.79.9	for thy name's sake!
PSA.79.10	Why should the nations say,
PSA.79.10	“Where is their God?”
PSA.79.10	Let the avenging of the outpoured blood of thy servants
PSA.79.10	be known among the nations before our eyes!
PSA.79.11	Let the groans of the prisoners come before thee;
PSA.79.11	according to thy great power preserve those doomed to die!
PSA.79.12	Return sevenfold into the bosom of our neighbors
PSA.79.12	the taunts with which they have taunted thee, O Lord!
PSA.79.13	Then we thy people, the flock of thy pasture,
PSA.79.13	will give thanks to thee for ever;
PSA.79.13	from generation to generation we will recount thy praise.
PSA.80.1	Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel,
PSA.80.1	thou who leadest Joseph like a flock!
PSA.80.1	Thou who art enthroned upon the cherubim, shine forth
PSA.80.2	before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh!
PSA.80.2	Stir up thy might,
PSA.80.2	and come to save us!
PSA.80.3	Restore us, O God;
PSA.80.3	let thy face shine, that we may be saved!
PSA.80.4	O 
PSA.80.4	how long wilt thou be angry with thy people's prayers?
PSA.80.5	Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears,
PSA.80.5	and given them tears to drink in full measure.
PSA.80.6	Thou dost make us the scorn
PSA.80.6	and our enemies laugh among themselves.
PSA.80.7	Restore us, O God of hosts;
PSA.80.7	let thy face shine, that we may be saved!
PSA.80.8	Thou didst bring a vine out of Egypt;
PSA.80.8	thou didst drive out the nations and plant it.
PSA.80.9	Thou didst clear the ground for it;
PSA.80.9	it took deep root and filled the land.
PSA.80.10	The mountains were covered with its shade,
PSA.80.10	the mighty cedars with its branches;
PSA.80.11	it sent out its branches to the sea,
PSA.80.11	and its shoots to the River.
PSA.80.12	Why then hast thou broken down its walls,
PSA.80.12	so that all who pass along the way pluck its fruit?
PSA.80.13	The boar from the forest ravages it,
PSA.80.13	and all that move in the field feed on it.
PSA.80.14	Turn again, O God of hosts!
PSA.80.14	Look down from heaven, and see;
PSA.80.14	have regard for this vine,
PSA.80.15	the stock which thy right hand planted.
PSA.80.16	They have burned it with fire, they have cut it down;
PSA.80.16	may they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance!
PSA.80.17	But let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand,
PSA.80.17	the son of man whom thou hast made strong for thyself!
PSA.80.18	Then we will never turn back from thee;
PSA.80.18	give us life, and we will call on thy name!
PSA.80.19	Restore us, O 
PSA.80.19	let thy face shine, that we may be saved!
PSA.81.1	Sing aloud to God our strength;
PSA.81.1	shout for joy to the God of Jacob!
PSA.81.2	Raise a song, sound the timbrel,
PSA.81.2	the sweet lyre with the harp.
PSA.81.3	Blow the trumpet at the new moon,
PSA.81.3	at the full moon, on our feast day.
PSA.81.4	For it is a statute for Israel,
PSA.81.4	an ordinance of the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.5	He made it a decree in Joseph,
PSA.81.5	when he went out over
PSA.81.5	I hear a voice I had not known:
PSA.81.6	“I relieved your
PSA.81.6	your
PSA.81.7	In distress you called, and I delivered you;
PSA.81.7	I answered you in the secret place of thunder;
PSA.81.7	I tested you at the waters of Meribah. 
PSA.81.8	Hear, O my people, while I admonish you!
PSA.81.8	O Israel, if you would but listen to me!
PSA.81.9	There shall be no strange god among you;
PSA.81.9	you shall not bow down to a foreign god.
PSA.81.10	I am the 
PSA.81.10	who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
PSA.81.10	Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.
PSA.81.11	“But my people did not listen to my voice;
PSA.81.11	Israel would have none of me.
PSA.81.12	So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts,
PSA.81.12	to follow their own counsels.
PSA.81.13	O that my people would listen to me,
PSA.81.13	that Israel would walk in my ways!
PSA.81.14	I would soon subdue their enemies,
PSA.81.14	and turn my hand against their foes.
PSA.81.15	Those who hate the 
PSA.81.15	and their fate would last for ever.
PSA.81.16	I would feed you
PSA.81.16	and with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.”
PSA.82.1	God has taken his place in the divine council;
PSA.82.1	in the midst of the gods he holds judgment:
PSA.82.2	“How long will you judge unjustly
PSA.82.2	and show partiality to the wicked? 
PSA.82.3	Give justice to the weak and the fatherless;
PSA.82.3	maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute.
PSA.82.4	Rescue the weak and the needy;
PSA.82.4	deliver them from the hand of the wicked.”
PSA.82.5	They have neither knowledge nor understanding,
PSA.82.5	they walk about in darkness;
PSA.82.5	all the foundations of the earth are shaken.
PSA.82.6	sons of the Most High, all of you;
PSA.82.7	nevertheless, you shall die like men,
PSA.82.7	and fall like any prince.”
PSA.82.8	Arise, O God, judge the earth;
PSA.82.8	for to thee belong all the nations!
PSA.83.1	O God, do not keep silence;
PSA.83.1	do not hold thy peace or be still, O God!
PSA.83.2	For lo, thy enemies are in tumult;
PSA.83.2	those who hate thee have raised their heads.
PSA.83.3	They lay crafty plans against thy people;
PSA.83.3	they consult together against thy protected ones.
PSA.83.4	They say, “Come, let us wipe them out as a nation;
PSA.83.4	let the name of Israel be remembered no more!”
PSA.83.5	Yea, they conspire with one accord;
PSA.83.5	against thee they make a covenant—
PSA.83.6	the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,
PSA.83.6	Moab and the Hagrites,
PSA.83.7	Gebal and Ammon and Amalek,
PSA.83.7	Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
PSA.83.8	Assyria also has joined them;
PSA.83.8	they are the strong arm of the children of Lot. 
PSA.83.9	Do to them as thou didst to Midian,
PSA.83.9	as to Sisera and Jabin at the river Kishon,
PSA.83.10	who were destroyed at En-dor,
PSA.83.10	who became dung for the ground.
PSA.83.11	Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
PSA.83.11	all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
PSA.83.12	who said, “Let us take possession for ourselves
PSA.83.12	of the pastures of God.”
PSA.83.13	O my God, make them like whirling dust,
PSA.83.13	like chaff before the wind.
PSA.83.14	As fire consumes the forest,
PSA.83.14	as the flame sets the mountains ablaze,
PSA.83.15	so do thou pursue them with thy tempest
PSA.83.15	and terrify them with thy hurricane!
PSA.83.16	Fill their faces with shame,
PSA.83.16	that they may seek thy name, O 
PSA.83.17	Let them be put to shame and dismayed for ever;
PSA.83.17	let them perish in disgrace.
PSA.83.18	Let them know that thou alone,
PSA.83.18	whose name is the 
PSA.83.18	art the Most High over all the earth.
PSA.84.1	How lovely is thy dwelling place,
PSA.84.1	O 
PSA.84.2	My soul longs, yea, faints
PSA.84.2	for the courts of the 
PSA.84.2	my heart and flesh sing for joy
PSA.84.2	to the living God.
PSA.84.3	Even the sparrow finds a home,
PSA.84.3	and the swallow a nest for herself,
PSA.84.3	where she may lay her young,
PSA.84.3	at thy altars, O 
PSA.84.3	my King and my God.
PSA.84.4	Blessed are those who dwell in thy house,
PSA.84.4	ever singing thy praise! 
PSA.84.5	Blessed are the men whose strength is in thee,
PSA.84.5	in whose heart are the highways to Zion.
PSA.84.6	As they go through the valley of Baca
PSA.84.6	they make it a place of springs;
PSA.84.6	the early rain also covers it with pools.
PSA.84.7	They go from strength to strength;
PSA.84.7	the God of gods will be seen in Zion.
PSA.84.8	O 
PSA.84.8	give ear, O God of Jacob! 
PSA.84.9	Behold our shield, O God;
PSA.84.9	look upon the face of thine anointed!
PSA.84.10	For a day in thy courts is better
PSA.84.10	than a thousand elsewhere.
PSA.84.10	I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God
PSA.84.10	than dwell in the tents of wickedness.
PSA.84.11	For the 
PSA.84.11	he bestows favor and honor.
PSA.84.11	No good thing does the 
PSA.84.11	from those who walk uprightly.
PSA.84.12	O 
PSA.84.12	blessed is the man who trusts in thee!
PSA.85.1	thou didst restore the fortunes of Jacob.
PSA.85.2	Thou didst forgive the iniquity of thy people;
PSA.85.2	thou didst pardon all their sin. 
PSA.85.3	Thou didst withdraw all thy wrath;
PSA.85.3	thou didst turn from thy hot anger.
PSA.85.4	Restore us again, O God of our salvation,
PSA.85.4	and put away thy indignation toward us!
PSA.85.5	Wilt thou be angry with us for ever?
PSA.85.5	Wilt thou prolong thy anger to all generations?
PSA.85.6	Wilt thou not revive us again,
PSA.85.6	that thy people may rejoice in thee?
PSA.85.7	Show us thy steadfast love, O 
PSA.85.7	and grant us thy salvation.
PSA.85.8	Let me hear what God the 
PSA.85.8	for he will speak peace to his people,
PSA.85.8	to his saints, to those who turn to him in their hearts.
PSA.85.9	Surely his salvation is at hand for those who fear him,
PSA.85.9	that glory may dwell in our land.
PSA.85.10	Steadfast love and faithfulness will meet;
PSA.85.10	righteousness and peace will kiss each other.
PSA.85.11	Faithfulness will spring up from the ground,
PSA.85.11	and righteousness will look down from the sky.
PSA.85.12	Yea, the 
PSA.85.12	and our land will yield its increase.
PSA.85.13	Righteousness will go before him,
PSA.85.13	and make his footsteps a way.
PSA.86.1	Incline thy ear, O 
PSA.86.1	for I am poor and needy.
PSA.86.2	Preserve my life, for I am godly;
PSA.86.2	save thy servant who trusts in thee.
PSA.86.2	Thou art my God; 
PSA.86.3	be gracious to me, O Lord,
PSA.86.3	for to thee do I cry all the day.
PSA.86.4	Gladden the soul of thy servant,
PSA.86.4	for to thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
PSA.86.5	For thou, O Lord, art good and forgiving,
PSA.86.5	abounding in steadfast love to all who call on thee.
PSA.86.6	Give ear, O 
PSA.86.6	hearken to my cry of supplication.
PSA.86.7	In the day of my trouble I call on thee,
PSA.86.7	for thou dost answer me.
PSA.86.8	There is none like thee among the gods, O Lord,
PSA.86.8	nor are there any works like thine.
PSA.86.9	All the nations thou hast made shall come
PSA.86.9	and bow down before thee, O Lord,
PSA.86.9	and shall glorify thy name.
PSA.86.10	For thou art great and doest wondrous things,
PSA.86.10	thou alone art God.
PSA.86.11	Teach me thy way, O 
PSA.86.11	that I may walk in thy truth;
PSA.86.11	unite my heart to fear thy name.
PSA.86.12	I give thanks to thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart,
PSA.86.12	and I will glorify thy name for ever.
PSA.86.13	For great is thy steadfast love toward me;
PSA.86.13	thou hast delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol.
PSA.86.14	O God, insolent men have risen up against me;
PSA.86.14	a band of ruthless men seek my life,
PSA.86.14	and they do not set thee before them.
PSA.86.15	But thou, O Lord, art a God merciful and gracious,
PSA.86.15	slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.
PSA.86.16	Turn to me and take pity on me;
PSA.86.16	give thy strength to thy servant,
PSA.86.16	and save the son of thy handmaid.
PSA.86.17	Show me a sign of thy favor,
PSA.86.17	that those who hate me may see and be put to shame
PSA.86.17	because thou, 
PSA.87.1	On the holy mount stands the city he founded;
PSA.87.2	the 
PSA.87.2	more than all the dwelling places of Jacob.
PSA.87.3	Glorious things are spoken of you,
PSA.87.3	O city of God. 
PSA.87.4	Among those who know me I mention Rahab and Babylon;
PSA.87.4	behold, Philistia and Tyre, with Ethiopia—
PSA.87.4	“This one was born there,” they say.
PSA.87.5	And of Zion it shall be said,
PSA.87.5	“This one and that one were born in her”;
PSA.87.5	for the Most High himself will establish her.
PSA.87.6	The 
PSA.87.6	“This one was born there.” 
PSA.87.7	Singers and dancers alike say,
PSA.87.7	“All my springs are in you.”
PSA.88.1	O 
PSA.88.1	I cry out in the night before thee.
PSA.88.2	Let my prayer come before thee,
PSA.88.2	incline thy ear to my cry!
PSA.88.3	For my soul is full of troubles,
PSA.88.3	and my life draws near to Sheol.
PSA.88.4	I am reckoned among those who go down to the Pit;
PSA.88.4	I am a man who has no strength,
PSA.88.5	like one forsaken among the dead,
PSA.88.5	like the slain that lie in the grave,
PSA.88.5	like those whom thou dost remember no more,
PSA.88.5	for they are cut off from thy hand.
PSA.88.6	Thou hast put me in the depths of the Pit,
PSA.88.6	in the regions dark and deep.
PSA.88.7	Thy wrath lies heavy upon me,
PSA.88.7	and thou dost overwhelm me with all thy waves. 
PSA.88.8	Thou hast caused my companions to shun me;
PSA.88.8	thou hast made me a thing of horror to them.
PSA.88.8	I am shut in so that I cannot escape;
PSA.88.9	my eye grows dim through sorrow.
PSA.88.9	Every day I call upon thee, O 
PSA.88.9	I spread out my hands to thee.
PSA.88.10	Dost thou work wonders for the dead?
PSA.88.10	Do the shades rise up to praise thee? 
PSA.88.11	Is thy steadfast love declared in the grave,
PSA.88.11	or thy faithfulness in Abaddon?
PSA.88.12	Are thy wonders known in the darkness,
PSA.88.12	or thy saving help in the land of forgetfulness?
PSA.88.13	But I, O 
PSA.88.13	in the morning my prayer comes before thee.
PSA.88.14	O 
PSA.88.14	Why dost thou hide thy face from me?
PSA.88.15	Afflicted and close to death from my youth up,
PSA.88.15	I suffer thy terrors; I am helpless.
PSA.88.16	Thy wrath has swept over me;
PSA.88.16	thy dread assaults destroy me.
PSA.88.17	They surround me like a flood all day long;
PSA.88.17	they close in upon me together.
PSA.88.18	Thou hast caused lover and friend to shun me;
PSA.88.18	my companions are in darkness.
PSA.89.1	I will sing of thy steadfast love, O 
PSA.89.1	with my mouth I will proclaim thy faithfulness to all generations.
PSA.89.2	For thy steadfast love was established for ever,
PSA.89.2	thy faithfulness is firm as the heavens.
PSA.89.3	I have sworn to David my servant:
PSA.89.4	‘I will establish your descendants for ever,
PSA.89.4	and build your throne for all generations.’ ” 
PSA.89.5	Let the heavens praise thy wonders, O 
PSA.89.5	thy faithfulness in the assembly of the holy ones!
PSA.89.6	For who in the skies can be compared to the 
PSA.89.6	Who among the heavenly beings
PSA.89.7	a God feared in the council of the holy ones,
PSA.89.7	great and terrible
PSA.89.8	O 
PSA.89.8	who is mighty as thou art, O 
PSA.89.8	with thy faithfulness round about thee?
PSA.89.9	Thou dost rule the raging of the sea;
PSA.89.9	when its waves rise, thou stillest them.
PSA.89.10	Thou didst crush Rahab like a carcass,
PSA.89.10	thou didst scatter thy enemies with thy mighty arm.
PSA.89.11	The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine;
PSA.89.11	the world and all that is in it, thou hast founded them.
PSA.89.12	The north and the south, thou hast created them;
PSA.89.12	Tabor and Hermon joyously praise thy name.
PSA.89.13	Thou hast a mighty arm;
PSA.89.13	strong is thy hand, high thy right hand.
PSA.89.14	Righteousness and justice are the foundation of thy throne;
PSA.89.14	steadfast love and faithfulness go before thee.
PSA.89.15	Blessed are the people who know the festal shout,
PSA.89.15	who walk, O 
PSA.89.16	who exult in thy name all the day,
PSA.89.16	and extol
PSA.89.17	For thou art the glory of their strength;
PSA.89.17	by thy favor our horn is exalted.
PSA.89.18	For our shield belongs to the 
PSA.89.18	our king to the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.89.19	Of old thou didst speak in a vision
PSA.89.19	to thy faithful one, and say:
PSA.89.19	“I have set the crown
PSA.89.19	I have exalted one chosen from the people.
PSA.89.20	with my holy oil I have anointed him;
PSA.89.21	so that my hand shall ever abide with him,
PSA.89.21	my arm also shall strengthen him.
PSA.89.22	The enemy shall not outwit him,
PSA.89.22	the wicked shall not humble him.
PSA.89.23	I will crush his foes before him
PSA.89.23	and strike down those who hate him.
PSA.89.24	My faithfulness and my steadfast love shall be with him,
PSA.89.24	and in my name shall his horn be exalted.
PSA.89.25	I will set his hand on the sea
PSA.89.25	and his right hand on the rivers.
PSA.89.26	He shall cry to me, ‘Thou art my Father,
PSA.89.26	my God, and the Rock of my salvation.’
PSA.89.27	the highest of the kings of the earth.
PSA.89.28	My steadfast love I will keep for him for ever,
PSA.89.28	and my covenant will stand firm for him.
PSA.89.29	I will establish his line for ever
PSA.89.29	and his throne as the days of the heavens.
PSA.89.30	If his children forsake my law
PSA.89.30	and do not walk according to my ordinances,
PSA.89.31	if they violate my statutes
PSA.89.31	and do not keep my commandments,
PSA.89.32	then I will punish their transgression with the rod
PSA.89.32	and their iniquity with scourges;
PSA.89.33	but I will not remove from him my steadfast love,
PSA.89.33	or be false to my faithfulness.
PSA.89.34	I will not violate my covenant,
PSA.89.34	or alter the word that went forth from my lips.
PSA.89.35	Once for all I have sworn by my holiness;
PSA.89.35	I will not lie to David.
PSA.89.36	His line shall endure for ever,
PSA.89.36	his throne as long as the sun before me.
PSA.89.37	it shall stand firm while the skies endure.”
PSA.89.38	But now thou hast cast off and rejected,
PSA.89.38	thou art full of wrath against thy anointed.
PSA.89.39	Thou hast renounced the covenant with thy servant;
PSA.89.39	thou hast defiled his crown in the dust.
PSA.89.40	Thou hast breached all his walls;
PSA.89.40	thou hast laid his strongholds in ruins.
PSA.89.41	All that pass by despoil him;
PSA.89.41	he has become the scorn of his neighbors.
PSA.89.42	Thou hast exalted the right hand of his foes;
PSA.89.42	thou hast made all his enemies rejoice.
PSA.89.43	Yea, thou hast turned back the edge of his sword,
PSA.89.43	and thou hast not made him stand in battle.
PSA.89.44	Thou hast removed the scepter from his hand,
PSA.89.44	and cast his throne to the ground.
PSA.89.45	Thou hast cut short the days of his youth;
PSA.89.45	thou hast covered him with shame. 
PSA.89.46	How long, O 
PSA.89.46	How long will thy wrath burn like fire?
PSA.89.47	Remember, O Lord,
PSA.89.47	for what vanity thou hast created all the sons of men!
PSA.89.48	What man can live and never see death?
PSA.89.48	Who can deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? 
PSA.89.49	Lord, where is thy steadfast love of old,
PSA.89.49	which by thy faithfulness thou didst swear to David?
PSA.89.50	Remember, O Lord, how thy servant is scorned;
PSA.89.50	how I bear in my bosom the insults
PSA.89.51	with which thy enemies taunt, O 
PSA.89.51	with which they mock the footsteps of thy anointed.
PSA.89.52	Blessed be the 
PSA.89.52	Amen and Amen.
PSA.90.1	Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place
PSA.90.1	in all generations.
PSA.90.2	Before the mountains were brought forth,
PSA.90.2	or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world,
PSA.90.2	from everlasting to everlasting thou art God.
PSA.90.3	Thou turnest man back to the dust,
PSA.90.3	and sayest, “Turn back, O children of men!”
PSA.90.4	are but as yesterday when it is past,
PSA.90.4	or as a watch in the night.
PSA.90.5	Thou dost sweep men away; they are like a dream,
PSA.90.5	like grass which is renewed in the morning:
PSA.90.6	in the morning it flourishes and is renewed;
PSA.90.6	in the evening it fades and withers.
PSA.90.7	For we are consumed by thy anger;
PSA.90.7	by thy wrath we are overwhelmed.
PSA.90.8	Thou hast set our iniquities before thee,
PSA.90.8	our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.
PSA.90.9	For all our days pass away under thy wrath,
PSA.90.9	our years come to an end
PSA.90.10	The years of our life are threescore and ten,
PSA.90.10	or even by reason of strength fourscore;
PSA.90.10	yet their span
PSA.90.10	they are soon gone, and we fly away.
PSA.90.11	Who considers the power of thy anger,
PSA.90.11	and thy wrath according to the fear of thee?
PSA.90.12	So teach us to number our days
PSA.90.12	that we may get a heart of wisdom.
PSA.90.13	Return, O 
PSA.90.13	Have pity on thy servants!
PSA.90.14	Satisfy us in the morning with thy steadfast love,
PSA.90.14	that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
PSA.90.15	Make us glad as many days as thou hast afflicted us,
PSA.90.15	and as many years as we have seen evil.
PSA.90.16	Let thy work be manifest to thy servants,
PSA.90.16	and thy glorious power to their children.
PSA.90.17	Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us,
PSA.90.17	and establish thou the work of our hands upon us,
PSA.90.17	yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.
PSA.91.1	He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High,
PSA.91.1	who abides in the shadow of the Almighty,
PSA.91.2	will say to the 
PSA.91.2	my God, in whom I trust.”
PSA.91.3	For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler
PSA.91.3	and from the deadly pestilence;
PSA.91.4	he will cover you with his pinions,
PSA.91.4	and under his wings you will find refuge;
PSA.91.4	his faithfulness is a shield and buckler.
PSA.91.5	You will not fear the terror of the night,
PSA.91.5	nor the arrow that flies by day,
PSA.91.6	nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness,
PSA.91.6	nor the destruction that wastes at noonday.
PSA.91.7	A thousand may fall at your side,
PSA.91.7	ten thousand at your right hand;
PSA.91.7	but it will not come near you.
PSA.91.8	You will only look with your eyes
PSA.91.8	and see the recompense of the wicked.
PSA.91.9	Because you have made the 
PSA.91.9	the Most High your habitation,
PSA.91.10	no evil shall befall you,
PSA.91.10	no scourge come near your tent.
PSA.91.11	to guard you in all your ways.
PSA.91.12	On their hands they will bear you up,
PSA.91.12	lest you dash your foot against a stone.
PSA.91.13	the young lion and the serpent you will trample under foot.
PSA.91.14	Because he cleaves to me in love, I will deliver him;
PSA.91.14	I will protect him, because he knows my name.
PSA.91.15	When he calls to me, I will answer him;
PSA.91.15	I will be with him in trouble,
PSA.91.15	I will rescue him and honor him.
PSA.91.16	With long life I will satisfy him,
PSA.91.16	and show him my salvation.
PSA.92.1	It is good to give thanks to the 
PSA.92.1	to sing praises to thy name, O Most High;
PSA.92.2	to declare thy steadfast love in the morning,
PSA.92.2	and thy faithfulness by night,
PSA.92.3	to the music of the lute and the harp,
PSA.92.3	to the melody of the lyre.
PSA.92.4	For thou, O 
PSA.92.4	at the works of thy hands I sing for joy.
PSA.92.5	How great are thy works, O 
PSA.92.5	Thy thoughts are very deep!
PSA.92.6	The dull man cannot know,
PSA.92.6	the stupid cannot understand this:
PSA.92.7	that, though the wicked sprout like grass
PSA.92.7	and all evildoers flourish,
PSA.92.7	they are doomed to destruction for ever,
PSA.92.8	but thou, O 
PSA.92.9	For lo, thy enemies, O 
PSA.92.9	for lo, thy enemies shall perish;
PSA.92.9	all evildoers shall be scattered.
PSA.92.10	But thou hast exalted my horn like that of the wild ox;
PSA.92.10	thou hast poured over me
PSA.92.11	My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies,
PSA.92.11	my ears have heard the doom of my evil assailants.
PSA.92.12	The righteous flourish like the palm tree,
PSA.92.12	and grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
PSA.92.13	They are planted in the house of the 
PSA.92.13	they flourish in the courts of our God.
PSA.92.14	They still bring forth fruit in old age,
PSA.92.14	they are ever full of sap and green,
PSA.92.15	to show that the 
PSA.92.15	he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
PSA.93.1	The 
PSA.93.1	the 
PSA.93.1	Yea, the world is established; it shall never be moved;
PSA.93.2	thy throne is established from of old;
PSA.93.2	thou art from everlasting.
PSA.93.3	The floods have lifted up, O 
PSA.93.3	the floods have lifted up their voice,
PSA.93.3	the floods lift up their roaring.
PSA.93.4	Mightier than the thunders of many waters,
PSA.93.4	mightier than the waves
PSA.93.4	the 
PSA.93.5	Thy decrees are very sure;
PSA.93.5	holiness befits thy house,
PSA.93.5	O 
PSA.94.1	O 
PSA.94.1	thou God of vengeance, shine forth!
PSA.94.2	Rise up, O judge of the earth;
PSA.94.2	render to the proud their deserts!
PSA.94.3	O 
PSA.94.3	how long shall the wicked exult?
PSA.94.4	They pour out their arrogant words,
PSA.94.4	they boast, all the evildoers.
PSA.94.5	They crush thy people, O 
PSA.94.5	and afflict thy heritage.
PSA.94.6	They slay the widow and the sojourner,
PSA.94.6	and murder the fatherless;
PSA.94.7	and they say, “The 
PSA.94.7	the God of Jacob does not perceive.”
PSA.94.8	Understand, O dullest of the people!
PSA.94.8	Fools, when will you be wise?
PSA.94.9	He who planted the ear, does he not hear?
PSA.94.9	He who formed the eye, does he not see?
PSA.94.10	He who chastens the nations, does he not chastise?
PSA.94.10	He who teaches men knowledge,
PSA.94.11	that they are but a breath.
PSA.94.12	Blessed is the man whom thou dost chasten, O 
PSA.94.12	and whom thou dost teach out of thy law
PSA.94.13	to give him respite from days of trouble,
PSA.94.13	until a pit is dug for the wicked.
PSA.94.14	For the 
PSA.94.14	he will not abandon his heritage;
PSA.94.15	for justice will return to the righteous,
PSA.94.15	and all the upright in heart will follow it.
PSA.94.16	Who rises up for me against the wicked?
PSA.94.16	Who stands up for me against evildoers?
PSA.94.17	If the 
PSA.94.17	my soul would soon have dwelt in the land of silence.
PSA.94.18	When I thought, “My foot slips,”
PSA.94.18	thy steadfast love, O 
PSA.94.19	When the cares of my heart are many,
PSA.94.19	thy consolations cheer my soul.
PSA.94.20	Can wicked rulers be allied with thee,
PSA.94.20	who frame mischief by statute?
PSA.94.21	They band together against the life of the righteous,
PSA.94.21	and condemn the innocent to death.
PSA.94.22	But the 
PSA.94.22	and my God the rock of my refuge.
PSA.94.23	He will bring back on them their iniquity
PSA.94.23	and wipe them out for their wickedness;
PSA.94.23	the 
PSA.95.1	O come, let us sing to the 
PSA.95.1	let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation!
PSA.95.2	Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving;
PSA.95.2	let us make a joyful noise to him with songs of praise!
PSA.95.3	For the 
PSA.95.3	and a great King above all gods.
PSA.95.4	In his hand are the depths of the earth;
PSA.95.4	the heights of the mountains are his also.
PSA.95.5	The sea is his, for he made it;
PSA.95.5	for his hands formed the dry land.
PSA.95.6	O come, let us worship and bow down,
PSA.95.6	let us kneel before the 
PSA.95.7	and we are the people of his pasture,
PSA.95.7	and the sheep of his hand.
PSA.95.7	O that today you would hearken to his voice!
PSA.95.8	Harden not your hearts, as at Meribah,
PSA.95.8	as on the day at Massah in the wilderness,
PSA.95.9	when your fathers tested me,
PSA.95.9	and put me to the proof, though they had seen my work.
PSA.95.10	For forty years I loathed that generation
PSA.95.10	and said, “They are a people who err in heart,
PSA.95.10	and they do not regard my ways.”
PSA.95.11	Therefore I swore in my anger
PSA.95.11	that they should not enter my rest.
PSA.96.1	sing to the 
PSA.96.2	Sing to the 
PSA.96.2	tell of his salvation from day to day.
PSA.96.3	Declare his glory among the nations,
PSA.96.3	his marvelous works among all the peoples!
PSA.96.4	For great is the 
PSA.96.4	he is to be feared above all gods.
PSA.96.5	For all the gods of the peoples are idols;
PSA.96.5	but the 
PSA.96.6	Honor and majesty are before him;
PSA.96.6	strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
PSA.96.7	Ascribe to the 
PSA.96.7	ascribe to the 
PSA.96.8	Ascribe to the 
PSA.96.8	bring an offering, and come into his courts!
PSA.96.9	Worship the 
PSA.96.9	tremble before him, all the earth!
PSA.96.10	Say among the nations, “The 
PSA.96.10	Yea, the world is established, it shall never be moved;
PSA.96.10	he will judge the peoples with equity.”
PSA.96.11	Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice;
PSA.96.11	let the sea roar, and all that fills it;
PSA.96.12	let the field exult, and everything in it!
PSA.96.12	Then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy
PSA.96.13	before the 
PSA.96.13	for he comes to judge the earth.
PSA.96.13	He will judge the world with righteousness,
PSA.96.13	and the peoples with his truth.
PSA.97.1	The 
PSA.97.1	let the many coastlands be glad!
PSA.97.2	Clouds and thick darkness are round about him;
PSA.97.2	righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.
PSA.97.3	Fire goes before him,
PSA.97.3	and burns up his adversaries round about.
PSA.97.4	His lightnings lighten the world;

PSA.97.8	Zion hears and is glad,

PSA.99.6	Moses and Aaron were among his priests,

PSA.100.5	and his faithfulness to all generations.
PSA.101.1	I will sing of loyalty and of justice;
PSA.101.1	to thee, O 
PSA.101.2	I will give heed to the way that is blameless.
PSA.101.2	Oh when wilt thou come to me?
PSA.101.2	I will walk with integrity of heart
PSA.101.2	within my house;
PSA.101.3	I will not set before my eyes
PSA.101.3	anything that is base.
PSA.101.3	I hate the work of those who fall away;
PSA.101.3	it shall not cleave to me.
PSA.101.4	Perverseness of heart shall be far from me;
PSA.101.4	I will know nothing of evil.
PSA.101.5	Him who slanders his neighbor secretly
PSA.101.5	I will destroy.
PSA.101.5	The man of haughty looks and arrogant heart
PSA.101.5	I will not endure.
PSA.101.6	I will look with favor on the faithful in the land,
PSA.101.6	that they may dwell with me;
PSA.101.6	he who walks in the way that is blameless
PSA.101.6	shall minster to me.
PSA.101.7	No man who practices deceit
PSA.101.7	shall dwell in my house;
PSA.101.7	no man who utters lies
PSA.101.7	shall continue in my presence.

PSA.101.8	all the wicked in the land,
PSA.101.8	cutting off all the evildoers
PSA.101.8	from the city of the 
PSA.102.1	Hear my prayer, O 
PSA.102.1	let my cry come to thee!
PSA.102.2	Do not hide thy face from me
PSA.102.2	in the day of my distress!
PSA.102.2	Incline thy ear to me;
PSA.102.2	answer me speedily in the day when I call!
PSA.102.3	For my days pass away like smoke,
PSA.102.3	and my bones burn like a furnace.
PSA.102.4	My heart is smitten like grass, and withered;
PSA.102.4	I forget to eat my bread.
PSA.102.5	Because of my loud groaning
PSA.102.5	my bones cleave to my flesh.
PSA.102.6	I am like a vulture
PSA.102.6	like an owl of the waste places;
PSA.102.7	I lie awake,
PSA.102.7	I am like a lonely bird on the housetop.
PSA.102.8	All the day my enemies taunt me,
PSA.102.8	those who deride me use my name for a curse.
PSA.102.9	For I eat ashes like bread,
PSA.102.9	and mingle tears with my drink,
PSA.102.10	because of thy indignation and anger;
PSA.102.10	for thou hast taken me up and thrown me away.
PSA.102.11	My days are like an evening shadow;
PSA.102.11	I wither away like grass.
PSA.102.12	But thou, O 
PSA.102.12	thy name endures to all generations.
PSA.102.13	Thou wilt arise and have pity on Zion;
PSA.102.13	it is the time to favor her;
PSA.102.13	the appointed time has come.
PSA.102.14	For thy servants hold her stones dear,
PSA.102.14	and have pity on her dust.
PSA.102.15	The nations will fear the name of the 
PSA.102.15	and all the kings of the earth thy glory.
PSA.102.16	For the 
PSA.102.16	he will appear in his glory;
PSA.102.17	he will regard the prayer of the destitute,
PSA.102.17	and will not despise their supplication.
PSA.102.18	Let this be recorded for a generation to come,
PSA.102.18	so that a people yet unborn may praise the 
PSA.102.19	that he looked down from his holy height,
PSA.102.19	from heaven the 
PSA.102.20	to hear the groans of the prisoners,
PSA.102.20	to set free those who were doomed to die;
PSA.102.21	that men may declare in Zion the name of the 
PSA.102.21	and in Jerusalem his praise,
PSA.102.22	when peoples gather together,
PSA.102.22	and kingdoms, to worship the 
PSA.102.23	He has broken my strength in midcourse;
PSA.102.23	he has shortened my days.
PSA.102.24	“O my God,” I say, “take me not hence
PSA.102.24	in the midst of my days,
PSA.102.24	thou whose years endure
PSA.102.24	throughout all generations!”
PSA.102.25	and the heavens are the work of thy hands.
PSA.102.26	They will perish, but thou dost endure;
PSA.102.26	they will all wear out like a garment.
PSA.102.26	Thou changest them like raiment, and they pass away;
PSA.102.27	but thou art the same, and thy years have no end.
PSA.102.28	The children of thy servants shall dwell secure;
PSA.102.28	their posterity shall be established before thee.
PSA.103.1	Bless the 
PSA.103.1	and all that is within me, bless his holy name!
PSA.103.2	Bless the 
PSA.103.2	and forget not all his benefits,
PSA.103.3	who forgives all your iniquity,
PSA.103.3	who heals all your diseases,
PSA.103.4	who redeems your life from the Pit,
PSA.103.4	who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy,
PSA.103.5	who satisfies you with good as long as you live
PSA.103.5	so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.
PSA.103.6	The 
PSA.103.6	and justice for all who are oppressed.
PSA.103.7	He made known his ways to Moses,
PSA.103.7	his acts to the people of Israel.
PSA.103.8	slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.
PSA.103.9	He will not always chide,
PSA.103.9	nor will he keep his anger for ever.
PSA.103.10	He does not deal with us according to our sins,
PSA.103.10	nor requite us according to our iniquities.
PSA.103.11	For as the heavens are high above the earth,
PSA.103.11	so great is his steadfast love toward those who fear him;
PSA.103.12	as far as the east is from the west,
PSA.103.12	so far does he remove our transgressions from us.
PSA.103.13	As a father pities his children,
PSA.103.13	so the 
PSA.103.14	For he knows our frame;
PSA.103.14	he remembers that we are dust.
PSA.103.15	As for man, his days are like grass;
PSA.103.15	he flourishes like a flower of the field;
PSA.103.16	for the wind passes over it, and it is gone,
PSA.103.16	and its place knows it no more.
PSA.103.17	upon those who fear him,
PSA.103.17	and his righteousness to children's children,
PSA.103.18	to those who keep his covenant
PSA.103.18	and remember to do his commandments.
PSA.103.19	The 
PSA.103.19	and his kingdom rules over all.
PSA.103.20	Bless the 
PSA.103.20	you mighty ones who do his word,
PSA.103.20	hearkening to the voice of his word!
PSA.103.21	Bless the 
PSA.103.21	his ministers that do his will!
PSA.103.22	Bless the 
PSA.103.22	in all places of his dominion.
PSA.103.22	Bless the 
PSA.104.1	Bless the 
PSA.104.1	O 
PSA.104.1	Thou art clothed with honor and majesty,
PSA.104.2	who coverest thyself with light as with a garment,
PSA.104.2	who hast stretched out the heavens like a tent,
PSA.104.3	who hast laid the beams of thy chambers on the waters,
PSA.104.3	who makest the clouds thy chariot,
PSA.104.3	who ridest on the wings of the wind,
PSA.104.4	fire and flame thy ministers.
PSA.104.5	Thou didst set the earth on its foundations,
PSA.104.5	so that it should never be shaken.
PSA.104.6	Thou didst cover it with the deep as with a garment;
PSA.104.6	the waters stood above the mountains.
PSA.104.7	At thy rebuke they fled;
PSA.104.7	at the sound of thy thunder they took to flight.
PSA.104.8	The mountains rose, the valleys sank down
PSA.104.8	to the place which thou didst appoint for them.
PSA.104.9	Thou didst set a bound which they should not pass,
PSA.104.9	so that they might not again cover the earth.
PSA.104.10	Thou makest springs gush forth in the valleys;
PSA.104.10	they flow between the hills,
PSA.104.11	they give drink to every beast of the field;
PSA.104.11	the wild asses quench their thirst.
PSA.104.12	they sing among the branches.
PSA.104.13	From thy lofty abode thou waterest the mountains;
PSA.104.13	the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy work.
PSA.104.14	Thou dost cause the grass to grow for the cattle,
PSA.104.14	and plants for man to cultivate,
PSA.104.14	that he may bring forth food from the earth,
PSA.104.15	and wine to gladden the heart of man,
PSA.104.15	oil to make his face shine,
PSA.104.15	and bread to strengthen man's heart.
PSA.104.16	The trees of the 
PSA.104.16	the cedars of Lebanon which he planted.
PSA.104.17	In them the birds build their nests;
PSA.104.17	the stork has her home in the fir trees.
PSA.104.18	The high mountains are for the wild goats;
PSA.104.18	the rocks are a refuge for the badgers.
PSA.104.19	Thou hast made the moon to mark the seasons;
PSA.104.19	the sun knows its time for setting.
PSA.104.20	Thou makest darkness, and it is night,
PSA.104.20	when all the beasts of the forest creep forth.
PSA.104.21	The young lions roar for their prey,
PSA.104.21	seeking their food from God.
PSA.104.22	When the sun rises, they get them away
PSA.104.22	and lie down in their dens.
PSA.104.23	Man goes forth to his work
PSA.104.23	and to his labor until the evening.
PSA.104.24	O 
PSA.104.24	In wisdom hast thou made them all;
PSA.104.24	the earth is full of thy creatures.
PSA.104.25	Yonder is the sea, great and wide,
PSA.104.25	which teems with things innumerable,
PSA.104.25	living things both small and great.
PSA.104.26	There go the ships,
PSA.104.26	and Leviathan which thou didst form to sport in it.
PSA.104.27	These all look to thee,
PSA.104.27	to give them their food in due season.
PSA.104.28	When thou givest to them, they gather it up;
PSA.104.28	when thou openest thy hand, they are filled with good things.
PSA.104.29	When thou hidest thy face, they are dismayed;
PSA.104.29	when thou takest away their breath, they die
PSA.104.29	and return to their dust.
PSA.104.30	When thou sendest forth thy Spirit,
PSA.104.30	and thou renewest the face of the ground.
PSA.104.31	May the glory of the 
PSA.104.31	may the 
PSA.104.32	who looks on the earth and it trembles,
PSA.104.32	who touches the mountains and they smoke!
PSA.104.33	I will sing to the 
PSA.104.33	I will sing praise to my God while I have being.
PSA.104.34	May my meditation be pleasing to him,
PSA.104.34	for I rejoice in the 
PSA.104.35	Let sinners be consumed from the earth,
PSA.104.35	and let the wicked be no more!
PSA.104.35	Bless the 
PSA.104.35	Praise the 
PSA.105.1	call on his name,
PSA.105.1	make known his deeds among the peoples!
PSA.105.2	Sing to him, sing praises to him,
PSA.105.2	tell of all his wonderful works!
PSA.105.3	Glory in his holy name;
PSA.105.3	let the hearts of those who seek the 
PSA.105.4	Seek the 
PSA.105.4	seek his presence continually!
PSA.105.5	Remember the wonderful works that he has done,
PSA.105.5	his miracles, and the judgments he uttered,
PSA.105.6	O offspring of Abraham his servant,
PSA.105.6	sons of Jacob, his chosen ones!
PSA.105.7	He is the 
PSA.105.7	his judgments are in all the earth.
PSA.105.8	of the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations,
PSA.105.9	the covenant which he made with Abraham,
PSA.105.9	his sworn promise to Isaac,
PSA.105.10	which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute,
PSA.105.10	to Israel as an everlasting covenant,
PSA.105.11	saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan
PSA.105.11	as your portion for an inheritance.”
PSA.105.12	When they were few in number,
PSA.105.12	of little account, and sojourners in it,
PSA.105.13	wandering from nation to nation,
PSA.105.13	from one kingdom to another people,
PSA.105.14	he allowed no one to oppress them;
PSA.105.14	he rebuked kings on their account,
PSA.105.15	saying, “Touch not my anointed ones,
PSA.105.15	do my prophets no harm!”
PSA.105.16	When he summoned a famine on the land,
PSA.105.16	and broke every staff of bread,
PSA.105.17	he had sent a man ahead of them,
PSA.105.17	Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
PSA.105.18	His feet were hurt with fetters,
PSA.105.18	his neck was put in a collar of iron;
PSA.105.19	until what he had said came to pass
PSA.105.19	the word of the 
PSA.105.20	The king sent and released him,
PSA.105.20	the ruler of the peoples set him free;
PSA.105.21	he made him lord of his house,
PSA.105.21	and ruler of all his possessions,
PSA.105.22	to instruct
PSA.105.22	and to teach his elders wisdom.
PSA.105.23	Then Israel came to Egypt;
PSA.105.23	Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
PSA.105.24	And the 
PSA.105.24	and made them stronger than their foes.
PSA.105.25	He turned their hearts to hate his people,
PSA.105.25	to deal craftily with his servants.
PSA.105.26	He sent Moses his servant,
PSA.105.26	and Aaron whom he had chosen.
PSA.105.27	They wrought his signs among them,
PSA.105.27	and miracles in the land of Ham.
PSA.105.28	He sent darkness, and made the land dark;
PSA.105.28	they rebelled
PSA.105.29	He turned their waters into blood,
PSA.105.29	and caused their fish to die.
PSA.105.30	Their land swarmed with frogs,
PSA.105.30	even in the chambers of their kings.
PSA.105.31	He spoke, and there came swarms of flies,
PSA.105.31	and gnats throughout their country.
PSA.105.32	He gave them hail for rain,
PSA.105.32	and lightning that flashed through their land.
PSA.105.33	He smote their vines and fig trees,
PSA.105.33	and shattered the trees of their country.
PSA.105.34	He spoke, and the locusts came,
PSA.105.34	and young locusts without number;
PSA.105.35	which devoured all the vegetation in their land,
PSA.105.35	and ate up the fruit of their ground.
PSA.105.36	He smote all the first-born in their land,
PSA.105.36	the first issue of all their strength.
PSA.105.37	Then he led forth Israel with silver and gold,
PSA.105.37	and there was none among his tribes who stumbled.
PSA.105.38	Egypt was glad when they departed,
PSA.105.38	for dread of them had fallen upon it.
PSA.105.39	He spread a cloud for a covering,
PSA.105.39	and fire to give light by night.
PSA.105.40	They asked, and he brought quails,
PSA.105.40	and gave them bread from heaven in abundance.
PSA.105.41	He opened the rock, and water gushed forth;
PSA.105.41	it flowed through the desert like a river.
PSA.105.42	For he remembered his holy promise,
PSA.105.42	and Abraham his servant.
PSA.105.43	So he led forth his people with joy,
PSA.105.43	his chosen ones with singing.
PSA.105.44	And he gave them the lands of the nations;
PSA.105.44	and they took possession of the fruit of the peoples' toil,
PSA.105.45	to the end that they should keep his statutes,
PSA.105.45	and observe his laws.
PSA.105.45	Praise the 
PSA.106.1	O give thanks to the 
PSA.106.1	for his steadfast love endures for ever!
PSA.106.2	Who can utter the mighty doings of the 
PSA.106.2	or show forth all his praise?
PSA.106.3	Blessed are they who observe justice,
PSA.106.3	who do righteousness at all times!
PSA.106.4	Remember me, O 
PSA.106.4	help me when thou deliverest them;
PSA.106.5	that I may see the prosperity of thy chosen ones,
PSA.106.5	that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation,
PSA.106.5	that I may glory with thy heritage.
PSA.106.6	Both we and our fathers have sinned;
PSA.106.6	we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
PSA.106.7	Our fathers, when they were in Egypt,
PSA.106.7	did not consider thy wonderful works;
PSA.106.7	they did not remember the abundance of thy steadfast love,
PSA.106.7	but rebelled against the Most High
PSA.106.7	at the Red Sea.
PSA.106.8	Yet he saved them for his name's sake,
PSA.106.8	that he might make known his mighty power.
PSA.106.9	He rebuked the Red Sea, and it became dry;
PSA.106.9	and he led them through the deep as through a desert.
PSA.106.10	So he saved them from the hand of the foe,
PSA.106.10	and delivered them from the power of the enemy.
PSA.106.11	And the waters covered their adversaries;
PSA.106.11	not one of them was left.
PSA.106.12	Then they believed his words;
PSA.106.12	they sang his praise.
PSA.106.13	But they soon forgot his works;
PSA.106.13	they did not wait for his counsel.
PSA.106.14	But they had a wanton craving in the wilderness,
PSA.106.14	and put God to the test in the desert;
PSA.106.15	he gave them what they asked,
PSA.106.15	but sent a wasting disease among them.
PSA.106.16	When men in the camp were jealous of Moses
PSA.106.16	and Aaron, the holy one of the 
PSA.106.17	the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
PSA.106.17	and covered the company of Abiram.
PSA.106.18	Fire also broke out in their company;
PSA.106.18	the flame burned up the wicked.
PSA.106.19	They made a calf in Horeb
PSA.106.19	and worshiped a molten image.
PSA.106.20	They exchanged the glory of God
PSA.106.20	for the image of an ox that eats grass.
PSA.106.21	They forgot God, their Savior,
PSA.106.21	who had done great things in Egypt,
PSA.106.22	wondrous works in the land of Ham,
PSA.106.22	and terrible things by the Red Sea.
PSA.106.23	Therefore he said he would destroy them—
PSA.106.23	had not Moses, his chosen one,
PSA.106.23	stood in the breach before him,
PSA.106.23	to turn away his wrath from destroying them.
PSA.106.24	Then they despised the pleasant land,
PSA.106.24	having no faith in his promise.
PSA.106.25	They murmured in their tents,
PSA.106.25	and did not obey the voice of the 
PSA.106.26	Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them
PSA.106.26	that he would make them fall in the wilderness,
PSA.106.27	and would disperse
PSA.106.27	scattering them over the lands.
PSA.106.28	Then they attached themselves to the Baal of Peor,
PSA.106.28	and ate sacrifices offered to the dead;
PSA.106.29	they provoked the 
PSA.106.29	and a plague broke out among them.
PSA.106.30	Then Phinehas stood up and interposed,
PSA.106.30	and the plague was stayed.
PSA.106.31	And that has been reckoned to him as righteousness
PSA.106.31	from generation to generation for ever.
PSA.106.32	They angered him at the waters of Meribah,
PSA.106.32	and it went ill with Moses on their account;
PSA.106.33	for they made his spirit bitter,
PSA.106.33	and he spoke words that were rash.
PSA.106.34	They did not destroy the peoples,
PSA.106.34	as the 
PSA.106.35	but they mingled with the nations
PSA.106.35	and learned to do as they did.
PSA.106.36	They served their idols,
PSA.106.36	which became a snare to them.
PSA.106.37	They sacrificed their sons
PSA.106.37	and their daughters to the demons;
PSA.106.38	they poured out innocent blood,
PSA.106.38	the blood of their sons and daughters,
PSA.106.38	whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan;
PSA.106.38	and the land was polluted with blood.
PSA.106.39	Thus they became unclean by their acts,
PSA.106.39	and played the harlot in their doings.
PSA.106.40	Then the anger of the 
PSA.106.40	and he abhorred his heritage;
PSA.106.41	he gave them into the hand of the nations,
PSA.106.41	so that those who hated them ruled over them.
PSA.106.42	Their enemies oppressed them,
PSA.106.42	and they were brought into subjection under their power.
PSA.106.43	Many times he delivered them,
PSA.106.43	but they were rebellious in their purposes,
PSA.106.43	and were brought low through their iniquity.
PSA.106.44	Nevertheless he regarded their distress,
PSA.106.44	when he heard their cry.
PSA.106.45	He remembered for their sake his covenant,
PSA.106.45	and relented according to the abundance of his steadfast love.
PSA.106.46	He caused them to be pitied
PSA.106.46	by all those who held them captive.
PSA.106.47	and gather us from among the nations,
PSA.106.47	that we may give thanks to thy holy name
PSA.106.47	and glory in thy praise.
PSA.106.48	Blessed be the 
PSA.106.48	from everlasting to everlasting!
PSA.106.48	And let all the people say, “Amen!”
PSA.106.48	Praise the 
PSA.107.1	O give thanks to the 
PSA.107.1	for his steadfast love endures for ever!
PSA.107.2	Let the redeemed of the 
PSA.107.2	whom he has redeemed from trouble
PSA.107.3	and gathered in from the lands,
PSA.107.3	from the east and from the west,
PSA.107.3	from the north and from the south.
PSA.107.4	Some wandered in desert wastes,
PSA.107.4	finding no way to a city to dwell in;
PSA.107.5	hungry and thirsty,
PSA.107.5	their soul fainted within them.
PSA.107.6	Then they cried to the 
PSA.107.6	and he delivered them from their distress;
PSA.107.7	he led them by a straight way,
PSA.107.7	till they reached a city to dwell in.
PSA.107.8	Let them thank the 
PSA.107.8	for his wonderful works to the sons of men!
PSA.107.9	For he satisfies him who is thirsty,
PSA.107.9	and the hungry he fills with good things.
PSA.107.10	Some sat in darkness and in gloom,
PSA.107.10	prisoners in affliction and in irons,
PSA.107.11	for they had rebelled against the words of God,
PSA.107.11	and spurned the counsel of the Most High.
PSA.107.12	Their hearts were bowed down with hard labor;
PSA.107.12	they fell down, with none to help.
PSA.107.13	Then they cried to the 
PSA.107.13	and he delivered them from their distress;
PSA.107.14	he brought them out of darkness and gloom,
PSA.107.14	and broke their bonds asunder.
PSA.107.15	Let them thank the 
PSA.107.15	for his wonderful works to the sons of men!
PSA.107.16	For he shatters the doors of bronze,
PSA.107.16	and cuts in two the bars of iron.
PSA.107.17	Some were sick
PSA.107.17	and because of their iniquities suffered affliction;
PSA.107.18	they loathed any kind of food,
PSA.107.18	and they drew near to the gates of death.
PSA.107.19	Then they cried to the 
PSA.107.19	and he delivered them from their distress;
PSA.107.20	he sent forth his word, and healed them,
PSA.107.20	and delivered them from destruction.
PSA.107.21	Let them thank the 
PSA.107.21	for his wonderful works to the sons of men!
PSA.107.22	And let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving,
PSA.107.22	and tell of his deeds in songs of joy!
PSA.107.23	Some went down to the sea in ships,
PSA.107.23	doing business on the great waters;
PSA.107.24	they saw the deeds of the 
PSA.107.24	his wondrous works in the deep.
PSA.107.25	For he commanded, and raised the stormy wind,
PSA.107.25	which lifted up the waves of the sea.
PSA.107.26	They mounted up to heaven, they went down to the depths;
PSA.107.26	their courage melted away in their evil plight;
PSA.107.27	they reeled and staggered like drunken men,
PSA.107.27	and were at their wits' end.
PSA.107.28	Then they cried to the 
PSA.107.28	and he delivered them from their distress;
PSA.107.29	he made the storm be still,
PSA.107.29	and the waves of the sea were hushed.
PSA.107.30	Then they were glad because they had quiet,
PSA.107.30	and he brought them to their desired haven.
PSA.107.31	Let them thank the 
PSA.107.31	for his wonderful works to the sons of men!
PSA.107.32	Let them extol him in the congregation of the people,
PSA.107.32	and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
PSA.107.33	He turns rivers into a desert,
PSA.107.33	springs of water into thirsty ground,
PSA.107.34	a fruitful land into a salty waste,
PSA.107.34	because of the wickedness of its inhabitants.
PSA.107.35	He turns a desert into pools of water,
PSA.107.35	a parched land into springs of water.
PSA.107.36	And there he lets the hungry dwell,
PSA.107.36	and they establish a city to live in;
PSA.107.37	they sow fields, and plant vineyards,
PSA.107.37	and get a fruitful yield.
PSA.107.38	By his blessing they multiply greatly;
PSA.107.38	and he does not let their cattle decrease.
PSA.107.39	When they are diminished and brought low
PSA.107.39	through oppression, trouble, and sorrow,
PSA.107.40	he pours contempt upon princes
PSA.107.40	and makes them wander in trackless wastes;
PSA.107.41	but he raises up the needy out of affliction,
PSA.107.41	and makes their families like flocks.
PSA.107.42	The upright see it and are glad;
PSA.107.42	and all wickedness stops its mouth.
PSA.107.43	Whoever is wise, let him give heed to these things;
PSA.107.43	let men consider the steadfast love of the 
PSA.108.1	my heart is steadfast!
PSA.108.1	I will sing and make melody!
PSA.108.1	Awake, my soul!
PSA.108.2	Awake, O harp and lyre!
PSA.108.2	I will awake the dawn!
PSA.108.3	I will give thanks to thee, O 
PSA.108.3	I will sing praises to thee among the nations.
PSA.108.4	For thy steadfast love is great above the heavens,
PSA.108.4	thy faithfulness reaches to the clouds.
PSA.108.5	Be exalted, O God, above the heavens!
PSA.108.5	Let thy glory be over all the earth!
PSA.108.6	give help by thy right hand, and answer me!
PSA.108.7	God has promised in his sanctuary:
PSA.108.7	“With exultation I will divide up Shechem,
PSA.108.7	and portion out the Vale of Succoth.
PSA.108.8	Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine;
PSA.108.8	Ephraim is my helmet;
PSA.108.8	Judah my scepter.
PSA.108.9	Moab is my washbasin;
PSA.108.9	upon Edom I cast my shoe;
PSA.108.9	over Philistia I shout in triumph.”
PSA.108.10	Who will bring me to the fortified city?
PSA.108.10	Who will lead me to Edom?
PSA.108.11	Hast thou not rejected us, O God?
PSA.108.11	Thou dost not go forth, O God, with our armies.
PSA.108.12	O grant us help against the foe,
PSA.108.12	for vain is the help of man!
PSA.108.13	With God we shall do valiantly;
PSA.108.13	it is he who will tread down our foes.
PSA.109.1	Be not silent, O God of my praise!
PSA.109.2	For wicked and deceitful mouths are opened against me,
PSA.109.2	speaking against me with lying tongues.
PSA.109.3	They beset me with words of hate,
PSA.109.3	and attack me without cause.
PSA.109.4	In return for my love they accuse me,
PSA.109.4	even as I make prayer for them.
PSA.109.5	So they reward me evil for good,
PSA.109.5	and hatred for my love.
PSA.109.6	Appoint a wicked man against him;
PSA.109.6	let an accuser bring him to trial.
PSA.109.7	When he is tried, let him come forth guilty;
PSA.109.7	let his prayer be counted as sin!
PSA.109.8	may another seize his goods!
PSA.109.9	May his children be fatherless,
PSA.109.9	and his wife a widow!
PSA.109.10	May his children wander about and beg;
PSA.109.10	may they be driven out of
PSA.109.11	May the creditor seize all that he has;
PSA.109.11	may strangers plunder the fruits of his toil!
PSA.109.12	Let there be none to extend kindness to him,
PSA.109.12	nor any to pity his fatherless children!
PSA.109.13	May his posterity be cut off;
PSA.109.13	may his name be blotted out in the second generation!
PSA.109.14	May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the 
PSA.109.14	and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out!
PSA.109.15	Let them be before the 
PSA.109.15	and may his
PSA.109.16	For he did not remember to show kindness,
PSA.109.16	but pursued the poor and needy
PSA.109.16	and the brokenhearted to their death.
PSA.109.17	He loved to curse; let curses come on him!
PSA.109.17	He did not like blessing; may it be far from him!
PSA.109.18	He clothed himself with cursing as his coat,
PSA.109.18	may it soak into his body like water,
PSA.109.18	like oil into his bones!
PSA.109.19	May it be like a garment which he wraps round him,
PSA.109.19	like a belt with which he daily girds himself!
PSA.109.20	May this be the reward of my accusers from the 
PSA.109.20	of those who speak evil against my life!
PSA.109.21	But thou, O God my Lord,
PSA.109.21	deal on my behalf for thy name's sake;
PSA.109.21	because thy steadfast love is good, deliver me!
PSA.109.22	For I am poor and needy,
PSA.109.22	and my heart is stricken within me.
PSA.109.23	I am gone, like a shadow at evening;
PSA.109.23	I am shaken off like a locust.
PSA.109.24	My knees are weak through fasting;
PSA.109.24	my body has become gaunt.
PSA.109.25	when they see me, they wag their heads.
PSA.109.26	Help me, O 
PSA.109.26	Save me according to thy steadfast love!
PSA.109.27	Let them know that this is thy hand;
PSA.109.27	thou, O 
PSA.109.28	Let them curse, but do thou bless!
PSA.109.28	Let my assailants be put to shame;
PSA.109.29	May my accusers be clothed with dishonor;
PSA.109.29	may they be wrapped in their own shame as in a mantle!
PSA.109.30	With my mouth I will give great thanks to the 
PSA.109.30	I will praise him in the midst of the throng.
PSA.109.31	For he stands at the right hand of the needy,
PSA.109.31	to save him from those who condemn him to death.

PSA.110.1	till I make your enemies your footstool.”

PSA.114.4	The mountains skipped like rams,
PSA.114.4	the hills like lambs.
PSA.114.5	What ails you, O sea, that you flee?

PSA.115.7	They have hands, but do not feel;
PSA.115.7	feet, but do not walk;
PSA.115.7	and they do not make a sound in their throat.
PSA.115.8	Those who make them are like them;
PSA.115.8	so are all who trust in them.
PSA.115.9	O Israel, trust in the

PSA.115.17	The dead do not praise the

PSA.116.3	The snares of death encompassed me;
PSA.116.3	the pangs of Sheol laid hold on me;
PSA.116.3	I suffered distress and anguish.
PSA.116.4	Then I called on the name of the

PSA.116.10	“I am greatly afflicted”;
PSA.116.11	I said in my consternation,
PSA.116.11	“Men are all a vain hope.”
PSA.116.12	What shall I render to the 
PSA.116.12	for all his bounty to me?
PSA.116.13	I will lift up the cup of salvation
PSA.116.13	and call on the name of the

PSA.118.5	Out of my distress I called on the 
PSA.118.5	the 
PSA.118.6	What can man do to me?
PSA.118.7	The

PSA.119.44	for ever and ever;
PSA.119.45	and I shall walk at liberty,
PSA.119.45	for I have sought thy precepts.

PSA.119.49	in which thou hast made me hope.
PSA.119.50	This is my comfort in my affliction
PSA.119.50	that thy promise gives me life.
PSA.119.51	Godless men utterly deride me,
PSA.119.51	but I do not turn away from thy law.
PSA.119.52	When I think of thy ordinances from of old,
PSA.119.52	I take comfort, O 
PSA.119.53	Hot indignation seizes me because of the wicked,
PSA.119.53	who forsake thy law.
PSA.119.54	Thy statutes have been my songs
PSA.119.54	in the house of my pilgrimage.
PSA.119.55	I remember thy name in the night, O 
PSA.119.55	and keep thy law.
PSA.119.56	This blessing has fallen to me,
PSA.119.56	that I have kept thy precepts.

PSA.119.58	be gracious to me according to thy promise.
PSA.119.59	When I think of thy ways,
PSA.119.59	I turn my feet to thy testimonies;
PSA.119.60	I hasten and do not delay
PSA.119.60	to keep thy commandments.
PSA.119.61	Though the cords of the wicked ensnare me,
PSA.119.61	I do not forget thy law.
PSA.119.62	At midnight I rise to praise thee,
PSA.119.62	because of thy righteous ordinances.
PSA.119.63	I am a companion of all who fear thee,
PSA.119.63	of those who keep thy precepts.
PSA.119.64	The earth, O 
PSA.119.64	teach me thy statutes!
PSA.119.65	Thou hast dealt well with thy servant,
PSA.119.65	O 
PSA.119.66	Teach me good judgment and knowledge,
PSA.119.66	for I believe in thy commandments.
PSA.119.67	Before I was afflicted I went astray;
PSA.119.67	but now I keep thy word.
PSA.119.68	Thou art good and doest good;
PSA.119.68	teach me thy statutes.
PSA.119.69	The godless besmear me with lies,
PSA.119.69	but with my whole heart I keep thy precepts;
PSA.119.70	their heart is gross like fat,
PSA.119.70	but I delight in thy law.
PSA.119.71	It is good for me that I was afflicted,
PSA.119.71	that I might learn thy statutes.
PSA.119.72	The law of thy mouth is better to me
PSA.119.72	than thousands of gold and silver pieces.
PSA.119.73	Thy hands have made and fashioned me;
PSA.119.73	give me understanding that I may learn thy commandments.
PSA.119.74	Those who fear thee shall see me and rejoice,
PSA.119.74	because I have hoped in thy word.
PSA.119.75	I know, O 
PSA.119.75	and that in faithfulness thou hast afflicted me.
PSA.119.76	Let thy steadfast love be ready to comfort me
PSA.119.76	according to thy promise to thy servant.
PSA.119.77	Let thy mercy come to me, that I may live;
PSA.119.77	for thy law is my delight.
PSA.119.78	Let the godless be put to shame,
PSA.119.78	because they have subverted me with guile;
PSA.119.78	as for me, I will meditate on thy precepts.
PSA.119.79	Let those who fear thee turn to me,
PSA.119.79	that they may know thy testimonies.
PSA.119.80	May my heart be blameless in thy statutes,
PSA.119.80	that I may not be put to shame!
PSA.119.81	My soul languishes for thy salvation;
PSA.119.81	I hope in thy word.
PSA.119.82	My eyes fail with watching for thy promise;
PSA.119.82	I ask, “When wilt thou comfort me?”
PSA.119.83	For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke,
PSA.119.83	yet I have not forgotten thy statutes.
PSA.119.84	How long must thy servant endure?
PSA.119.84	When wilt thou judge those who persecute me?
PSA.119.85	Godless men have dug pitfalls for me,
PSA.119.85	men who do not conform to thy law.
PSA.119.86	All thy commandments are sure;
PSA.119.86	they persecute me with falsehood; help me!
PSA.119.87	They have almost made an end of me on earth;
PSA.119.87	but I have not forsaken thy precepts.
PSA.119.88	In thy steadfast love spare my life,
PSA.119.88	that I may keep the testimonies of thy mouth.
PSA.119.89	For ever, O 
PSA.119.89	is firmly fixed in the heavens.
PSA.119.90	Thy faithfulness endures to all generations;
PSA.119.90	thou hast established the earth, and it stands fast.
PSA.119.91	By thy appointment they stand this day;
PSA.119.91	for all things are thy servants.
PSA.119.92	If thy law had not been my delight,
PSA.119.92	I should have perished in my affliction.
PSA.119.93	I will never forget thy precepts;
PSA.119.93	for by them thou hast given me life.
PSA.119.94	I am thine, save me;
PSA.119.94	for I have sought thy precepts.
PSA.119.95	The wicked lie in wait to destroy me;
PSA.119.95	but I consider thy testimonies.
PSA.119.96	I have seen a limit to all perfection,
PSA.119.96	but thy commandment is exceedingly broad.
PSA.119.97	Oh, how I love thy law!
PSA.119.97	It is my meditation all the day.
PSA.119.98	Thy commandment makes me wiser than my enemies,
PSA.119.98	for it is ever with me.
PSA.119.99	I have more understanding than all my teachers,
PSA.119.99	for thy testimonies are my meditation.
PSA.119.100	I understand more than the aged,
PSA.119.100	for I keep thy precepts.
PSA.119.101	I hold back my feet from every evil way,
PSA.119.101	in order to keep thy word.
PSA.119.102	I do not turn aside from thy ordinances,
PSA.119.102	for thou hast taught me.
PSA.119.103	How sweet are thy words to my taste,
PSA.119.103	sweeter than honey to my mouth!
PSA.119.104	Through thy precepts I get understanding;
PSA.119.104	therefore I hate every false way.
PSA.119.105	Thy word is a lamp to my feet
PSA.119.105	and a light to my path.
PSA.119.106	I have sworn an oath and confirmed it,
PSA.119.106	to observe thy righteous ordinances.
PSA.119.107	I am sorely afflicted;
PSA.119.107	give me life, O 
PSA.119.108	Accept my offerings of praise, O 
PSA.119.108	and teach me thy ordinances.
PSA.119.109	I hold my life in my hand continually,
PSA.119.109	but I do not forget thy law.
PSA.119.110	The wicked have laid a snare for me,
PSA.119.110	but I do not stray from thy precepts.
PSA.119.111	Thy testimonies are my heritage for ever;
PSA.119.111	yea, they are the joy of my heart.
PSA.119.112	I incline my heart to perform thy statutes
PSA.119.112	for ever, to the end.
PSA.119.113	I hate double-minded men,
PSA.119.113	but I love thy law.
PSA.119.114	Thou art my hiding place and my shield;
PSA.119.114	I hope in thy word.
PSA.119.115	Depart from me, you evildoers,
PSA.119.115	that I may keep the commandments of my God.
PSA.119.116	Uphold me according to thy promise, that I may live,
PSA.119.116	and let me not be put to shame in my hope!
PSA.119.117	Hold me up, that I may be safe
PSA.119.117	and have regard for thy statutes continually!
PSA.119.118	Thou dost spurn all who go astray from thy statutes;
PSA.119.118	yea, their cunning is in vain.
PSA.119.119	All the wicked of the earth thou dost count as dross;
PSA.119.119	therefore I love thy testimonies.
PSA.119.120	My flesh trembles for fear of thee,
PSA.119.120	and I am afraid of thy judgments.
PSA.119.121	I have done what is just and right;
PSA.119.121	do not leave me to my oppressors.
PSA.119.122	Be surety for thy servant for good;
PSA.119.122	let not the godless oppress me.
PSA.119.123	My eyes fail with watching for thy salvation,
PSA.119.123	and for the fulfilment of thy righteous promise.
PSA.119.124	Deal with thy servant according to thy steadfast love,
PSA.119.124	and teach me thy statutes.
PSA.119.125	I am thy servant; give me understanding,
PSA.119.125	that I may know thy testimonies!
PSA.119.126	It is time for the 
PSA.119.126	for thy law has been broken.
PSA.119.127	Therefore I love thy commandments
PSA.119.127	above gold, above fine gold.
PSA.119.128	Therefore I direct my steps by all thy precepts;
PSA.119.128	I hate every false way.
PSA.119.129	Thy testimonies are wonderful;
PSA.119.129	therefore my soul keeps them.
PSA.119.130	The unfolding of thy words gives light;
PSA.119.130	it imparts understanding to the simple.
PSA.119.131	With open mouth I pant,
PSA.119.131	because I long for thy commandments.
PSA.119.132	Turn to me and be gracious to me,
PSA.119.132	as is thy wont toward those who love thy name.
PSA.119.133	Keep steady my steps according to thy promise,
PSA.119.133	and let no iniquity get dominion over me.
PSA.119.134	Redeem me from man's oppression,
PSA.119.134	that I may keep thy precepts.
PSA.119.135	Make thy face shine upon thy servant,
PSA.119.135	and teach me thy statutes.
PSA.119.136	My eyes shed streams of tears,
PSA.119.136	because men do not keep thy law.
PSA.119.137	Righteous art thou, O 
PSA.119.137	and right are thy judgments.
PSA.119.138	Thou hast appointed thy testimonies in righteousness
PSA.119.138	and in all faithfulness.
PSA.119.139	My zeal consumes me,
PSA.119.139	because my foes forget thy words.
PSA.119.140	Thy promise is well tried,
PSA.119.140	and thy servant loves it.
PSA.119.141	I am small and despised,
PSA.119.141	yet I do not forget thy precepts.
PSA.119.142	Thy righteousness is righteous for ever,
PSA.119.142	and thy law is true.
PSA.119.143	Trouble and anguish have come upon me,
PSA.119.143	but thy commandments are my delight.
PSA.119.144	Thy testimonies are righteous for ever;
PSA.119.144	give me understanding that I may live.
PSA.119.145	With my whole heart I cry; answer me, O 
PSA.119.145	I will keep thy statutes.
PSA.119.146	I cry to thee; save me,
PSA.119.146	that I may observe thy testimonies.
PSA.119.147	I rise before dawn and cry for help;
PSA.119.147	I hope in thy words.
PSA.119.148	My eyes are awake before the watches of the night,
PSA.119.148	that I may meditate upon thy promise.
PSA.119.149	Hear my voice in thy steadfast love;
PSA.119.149	O 
PSA.119.150	They draw near who persecute me with evil purpose;
PSA.119.150	they are far from thy law.
PSA.119.151	But thou art near, O 
PSA.119.151	and all thy commandments are true.
PSA.119.152	Long have I known from thy testimonies
PSA.119.152	that thou hast founded them for ever.
PSA.119.153	Look on my affliction and deliver me,
PSA.119.153	for I do not forget thy law.
PSA.119.154	Plead my cause and redeem me;
PSA.119.154	give me life according to thy promise!
PSA.119.155	Salvation is far from the wicked,
PSA.119.155	for they do not seek thy statutes.
PSA.119.156	Great is thy mercy, O 
PSA.119.156	give me life according to thy justice.
PSA.119.157	Many are my persecutors and my adversaries,
PSA.119.157	but I do not swerve from thy testimonies.
PSA.119.158	I look at the faithless with disgust,
PSA.119.158	because they do not keep thy commands.
PSA.119.159	Consider how I love thy precepts!
PSA.119.159	Preserve my life according to thy steadfast love.
PSA.119.160	The sum of thy word is truth;
PSA.119.160	and every one of thy righteous ordinances endures for ever.
PSA.119.161	Princes persecute me without cause,
PSA.119.161	but my heart stands in awe of thy words.
PSA.119.162	I rejoice at thy word
PSA.119.162	like one who finds great spoil.
PSA.119.163	I hate and abhor falsehood,
PSA.119.163	but I love thy law.
PSA.119.164	Seven times a day I praise thee
PSA.119.164	for thy righteous ordinances.
PSA.119.165	Great peace have those who love thy law;
PSA.119.165	nothing can make them stumble.
PSA.119.166	I hope for thy salvation, O 
PSA.119.166	and I do thy commandments.
PSA.119.167	My soul keeps thy testimonies;
PSA.119.167	I love them exceedingly.
PSA.119.168	I keep thy precepts and testimonies,
PSA.119.168	for all my ways are before thee.
PSA.119.169	Let my cry come before thee, O 
PSA.119.169	give me understanding according to thy word!
PSA.119.170	Let my supplication come before thee;
PSA.119.170	deliver me according to thy word.
PSA.119.171	My lips will pour forth praise
PSA.119.171	that thou dost teach me thy statutes.
PSA.119.172	My tongue will sing of thy word,
PSA.119.172	for all thy commandments are right.
PSA.119.173	Let thy hand be ready to help me,
PSA.119.173	for I have chosen thy precepts.
PSA.119.174	I long for thy salvation, O 
PSA.119.174	and thy law is my delight.
PSA.119.175	Let me live, that I may praise thee,
PSA.119.175	and let thy ordinances help me.
PSA.119.176	I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant,
PSA.119.176	for I do not forget thy commandments.
PSA.120.1	In my distress I cry to the 
PSA.120.1	that he may answer me:
PSA.120.2	“Deliver me, O 
PSA.120.2	from lying lips,
PSA.120.2	from a deceitful tongue.”
PSA.120.3	What shall be given to you?
PSA.120.3	And what more shall be done to you,
PSA.120.3	you deceitful tongue?
PSA.120.4	A warrior's sharp arrows,
PSA.120.4	with glowing coals of the broom tree!
PSA.120.5	Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech,
PSA.120.5	that I dwell among the tents of Kedar!
PSA.120.6	Too long have I had my dwelling
PSA.120.6	among those who hate peace.
PSA.120.7	I am for peace;
PSA.120.7	but when I speak,
PSA.120.7	they are for war!
PSA.121.1	I lift up my eyes to the hills.
PSA.121.1	From whence does my help come?
PSA.121.2	My help comes from the 
PSA.121.2	who made heaven and earth.
PSA.121.3	He will not let your foot be moved,
PSA.121.3	he who keeps you will not slumber.
PSA.121.4	Behold, he who keeps Israel
PSA.121.4	will neither slumber nor sleep.
PSA.121.5	The 
PSA.121.5	the 
PSA.121.5	on your right hand.
PSA.121.6	The sun shall not smite you by day,
PSA.121.6	nor the moon by night.
PSA.121.7	The 
PSA.121.7	he will keep your life.
PSA.121.8	The 
PSA.121.8	your going out and your coming in
PSA.121.8	from this time forth and for evermore.
PSA.122.1	I was glad when they said to me,
PSA.122.1	“Let us go to the house of the 
PSA.122.2	Our feet have been standing
PSA.122.2	within your gates, O Jerusalem!
PSA.122.3	Jerusalem, built as a city
PSA.122.3	which is bound firmly together,
PSA.122.4	to which the tribes go up,
PSA.122.4	the tribes of the 
PSA.122.4	as was decreed for Israel,
PSA.122.4	to give thanks to the name of the 
PSA.122.5	There thrones for judgment were set,
PSA.122.5	the thrones of the house of David.
PSA.122.6	Pray for the peace of Jerusalem!
PSA.122.6	“May they prosper who love you!
PSA.122.7	Peace be within your walls,
PSA.122.7	and security within your towers!”
PSA.122.8	For my brethren and companions' sake
PSA.122.8	I will say, “Peace be within you!”
PSA.122.9	For the sake of the house of the 
PSA.122.9	I will seek your good.
PSA.123.1	To thee I lift up my eyes,
PSA.123.1	O thou who art enthroned in the heavens!
PSA.123.2	Behold, as the eyes of servants
PSA.123.2	look to the hand of their master,
PSA.123.2	as the eyes of a maid
PSA.123.2	to the hand of her mistress,
PSA.123.2	so our eyes look to the 
PSA.123.2	till he have mercy upon us.
PSA.123.3	Have mercy upon us, O 
PSA.123.3	for we have had more than enough of contempt.
PSA.123.4	Too long our soul has been sated
PSA.123.4	with the scorn of those who are at ease,
PSA.123.4	the contempt of the proud.
PSA.124.1	If it had not been the 
PSA.124.1	let Israel now say—
PSA.124.2	if it had not been the 
PSA.124.2	when men rose up against us,
PSA.124.3	then they would have swallowed us up alive,
PSA.124.3	when their anger was kindled against us;
PSA.124.4	then the flood would have swept us away,
PSA.124.4	the torrent would have gone over us;
PSA.124.5	then over us would have gone
PSA.124.5	the raging waters.
PSA.124.6	Blessed be the 
PSA.124.6	who has not given us
PSA.124.6	as prey to their teeth!
PSA.124.7	We have escaped as a bird
PSA.124.7	from the snare of the fowlers;
PSA.124.7	the snare is broken,
PSA.124.7	and we have escaped!
PSA.124.8	Our help is in the name of the 
PSA.124.8	who made heaven and earth.
PSA.125.1	Those who trust in the 
PSA.125.1	which cannot be moved, but abides for ever.
PSA.125.2	As the mountains are round about Jerusalem,
PSA.125.2	so the 
PSA.125.2	from this time forth and for evermore.
PSA.125.3	For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest
PSA.125.3	upon the land allotted to the righteous,
PSA.125.3	lest the righteous put forth
PSA.125.3	their hands to do wrong.
PSA.125.4	Do good, O 
PSA.125.4	and to those who are upright in their hearts!
PSA.125.5	But those who turn aside upon their crooked ways
PSA.125.5	the 
PSA.125.5	Peace be in Israel!
PSA.126.1	When the 
PSA.126.1	we were like those who dream.
PSA.126.2	Then our mouth was filled with laughter,
PSA.126.2	and our tongue with shouts of joy;
PSA.126.2	then they said among the nations,
PSA.126.2	“The 
PSA.126.3	The 
PSA.126.3	we are glad.
PSA.126.4	Restore our fortunes, O 
PSA.126.4	like the watercourses in the Negeb!
PSA.126.5	May those who sow in tears
PSA.126.5	reap with shouts of joy!
PSA.126.6	He that goes forth weeping,
PSA.126.6	bearing the seed for sowing,
PSA.126.6	shall come home with shouts of joy,
PSA.126.6	bringing his sheaves with him.
PSA.127.1	Unless the 
PSA.127.1	those who build it labor in vain.
PSA.127.1	Unless the 
PSA.127.1	the watchman stays awake in vain.
PSA.127.2	It is in vain that you rise up early and go late to rest,
PSA.127.2	eating the bread of anxious toil;
PSA.127.2	for
PSA.127.3	Lo, sons are a heritage from the 
PSA.127.3	the fruit of the womb a reward.
PSA.127.4	Like arrows in the hand of a warrior
PSA.127.4	are the sons of one's youth.
PSA.127.5	Happy is the man who has
PSA.127.5	his quiver full of them!
PSA.127.5	He shall not be put to shame
PSA.127.5	when he speaks with his enemies in the gate.
PSA.128.1	Blessed is every one who fears the 
PSA.128.1	who walks in his ways!
PSA.128.2	You shall eat the fruit of the labor of your hands;
PSA.128.2	you shall be happy, and it shall be well with you.
PSA.128.3	Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house;
PSA.128.3	your children will be like olive shoots
PSA.128.3	around your table.
PSA.128.4	Lo, thus shall the man be blessed who fears the 
PSA.128.5	The 
PSA.128.5	May you see the prosperity of Jerusalem
PSA.128.5	all the days of your life!
PSA.128.6	May you see your children's children!
PSA.128.6	Peace be upon Israel!
PSA.129.1	“Sorely have they afflicted me from my youth,”
PSA.129.1	let Israel now say—
PSA.129.2	“Sorely have they afflicted me from my youth,
PSA.129.2	yet they have not prevailed against me.
PSA.129.3	The plowers plowed upon my back;
PSA.129.3	they made long their furrows.”
PSA.129.4	The 
PSA.129.4	he has cut the cords of the wicked.
PSA.129.5	May all who hate Zion
PSA.129.5	be put to shame and turned backward!
PSA.129.6	Let them be like the grass on the housetops,
PSA.129.6	which withers before it grows up,
PSA.129.7	with which the reaper does not fill his hand
PSA.129.7	or the binder of sheaves his bosom,
PSA.129.8	while those who pass by do not say,
PSA.129.8	“The blessing of the 
PSA.129.8	We bless you in the name of the 
PSA.130.1	Out of the depths I cry to thee, O 
PSA.130.2	Lord, hear my voice!
PSA.130.2	Let thy ears be attentive
PSA.130.2	to the voice of my supplications!
PSA.130.3	Lord, who could stand?
PSA.130.4	But there is forgiveness with thee,
PSA.130.4	that thou mayest be feared.
PSA.130.5	I wait for the 
PSA.130.5	and in his word I hope;
PSA.130.6	my soul waits for the 
PSA.130.6	more than watchmen for the morning,
PSA.130.6	more than watchmen for the morning.
PSA.130.7	O Israel, hope in the 
PSA.130.7	For with the 
PSA.130.7	and with him is plenteous redemption.
PSA.130.8	And he will redeem Israel
PSA.130.8	from all his iniquities.
PSA.131.1	O 
PSA.131.1	my eyes are not raised too high;
PSA.131.1	I do not occupy myself with things
PSA.131.1	too great and too marvelous for me.
PSA.131.2	But I have calmed and quieted my soul,
PSA.131.2	like a child quieted at its mother's breast;
PSA.131.2	like a child that is quieted is my soul.
PSA.131.3	O Israel, hope in the 
PSA.131.3	from this time forth and for evermore.
PSA.132.1	Remember, O 
PSA.132.1	all the hardships he endured;
PSA.132.2	how he swore to the 
PSA.132.2	and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob,
PSA.132.3	“I will not enter my house
PSA.132.3	or get into my bed;
PSA.132.4	I will not give sleep to my eyes
PSA.132.4	or slumber to my eyelids,
PSA.132.5	until I find a place for the 
PSA.132.5	a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.”
PSA.132.6	Lo, we heard of it in Ephrathah,
PSA.132.6	we found it in the fields of Jaar.
PSA.132.7	“Let us go to his dwelling place;
PSA.132.7	let us worship at his footstool!”
PSA.132.8	Arise, O 
PSA.132.8	thou and the ark of thy might.
PSA.132.9	Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness,
PSA.132.9	and let thy saints shout for joy.
PSA.132.10	For thy servant David's sake
PSA.132.10	do not turn away the face of thy anointed one.
PSA.132.11	from which he will not turn back:
PSA.132.11	“One of the sons of your body
PSA.132.11	I will set on your throne.
PSA.132.12	If your sons keep my covenant
PSA.132.12	and my testimonies which I shall teach them,
PSA.132.12	their sons also for ever
PSA.132.12	shall sit upon your throne.”
PSA.132.13	For the 
PSA.132.13	he has desired it for his habitation:
PSA.132.14	“This is my resting place for ever;
PSA.132.14	here I will dwell, for I have desired it.
PSA.132.15	I will abundantly bless her provisions;
PSA.132.15	I will satisfy her poor with bread.
PSA.132.16	Her priests I will clothe with salvation,
PSA.132.16	and her saints will shout for joy.
PSA.132.17	There I will make a horn to sprout for David;
PSA.132.17	I have prepared a lamp for my anointed.
PSA.132.18	His enemies I will clothe with shame,
PSA.132.18	but upon himself his crown will shed its luster.”
PSA.133.1	Behold, how good and pleasant it is
PSA.133.1	when brothers dwell in unity!
PSA.133.2	It is like the precious oil upon the head,
PSA.133.2	running down upon the beard,
PSA.133.2	upon the beard of Aaron,
PSA.133.2	running down on the collar of his robes!
PSA.133.3	It is like the dew of Hermon,
PSA.133.3	which falls on the mountains of Zion!
PSA.133.3	For there the 
PSA.133.3	life for evermore.
PSA.134.1	Come, bless the 
PSA.134.1	all you servants of the 
PSA.134.1	who stand by night in the house of the 
PSA.134.2	Lift up your hands to the holy place,
PSA.134.2	and bless the

PSA.135.4	For the 
PSA.135.4	Israel as his own possession.
PSA.135.5	For I know that the 
PSA.135.5	and that our Lord is above all gods.
PSA.135.6	Whatever the 
PSA.135.6	in heaven and on earth,
PSA.135.6	in the seas and all deeps.
PSA.135.7	He it is who makes the clouds rise at the end of the earth,
PSA.135.7	who makes lightnings for the rain
PSA.135.7	and brings forth the wind from his storehouses.
PSA.135.8	He it was who smote the first-born of Egypt,
PSA.135.8	both of man and of beast;
PSA.135.9	who in thy midst, O Egypt,
PSA.135.9	sent signs and wonders
PSA.135.9	against Pharaoh and all his servants;
PSA.135.10	who smote many nations
PSA.135.10	and slew mighty kings,
PSA.135.11	Sihon, king of the Amorites,
PSA.135.11	and Og, king of Bashan,
PSA.135.11	and all the kingdoms of Canaan,
PSA.135.12	and gave their land as a heritage,
PSA.135.12	a heritage to his people Israel.
PSA.135.13	Thy name, O 
PSA.135.13	thy renown, O 
PSA.135.14	and have compassion on his servants.
PSA.135.15	the work of men's hands.
PSA.135.16	They have mouths, but they speak not,
PSA.135.16	they have eyes, but they see not,
PSA.135.17	they have ears, but they hear not,
PSA.135.17	nor is there any breath in their mouths.
PSA.135.18	Like them be those who make them!—
PSA.135.18	yea, every one who trusts in them!
PSA.135.19	O house of Israel, bless the 
PSA.135.19	O house of Aaron, bless the 
PSA.135.20	O house of Levi, bless the 
PSA.135.20	You that fear the

PSA.136.14	and made Israel pass through the midst of it,
PSA.136.14	for his steadfast love endures for ever;

PSA.136.20	and Og, king of Bashan,

PSA.136.22	a heritage to Israel his servant,
PSA.136.22	for his steadfast love endures for ever.
PSA.136.23	It is he who remembered us in our low estate,
PSA.136.23	for his steadfast love endures for ever;
PSA.136.24	and rescued us from our foes,
PSA.136.24	for his steadfast love endures for ever;

PSA.137.1	By the waters
PSA.137.1	there we sat down and wept,
PSA.137.1	when we remembered Zion.
PSA.137.2	On the willows
PSA.137.2	we hung up our lyres.
PSA.137.3	For there our captors
PSA.137.3	required of us songs,
PSA.137.3	and our tormentors, mirth, saying,
PSA.137.3	“Sing us one of the songs of Zion!”
PSA.137.4	How shall we sing the 
PSA.137.4	in a foreign land?
PSA.137.5	If I forget you, O Jerusalem,
PSA.137.5	let my right hand wither!
PSA.137.6	Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth,
PSA.137.6	if I do not remember you,
PSA.137.6	if I do not set Jerusalem
PSA.137.6	above my highest joy!
PSA.137.7	Remember, O 
PSA.137.7	the day of Jerusalem,
PSA.137.7	how they said, “Raze it, raze it!
PSA.137.7	Down to its foundations!”
PSA.137.8	O daughter of Babylon, you devastator!
PSA.137.8	Happy shall he be who requites you
PSA.137.8	with what you have done to us!
PSA.137.9	Happy shall he be who takes your little ones
PSA.137.9	and dashes them against the rock!
PSA.138.1	I give thee thanks, O 
PSA.138.1	before the gods I sing thy praise;
PSA.138.2	I bow down toward thy holy temple
PSA.138.2	and give thanks to thy name for thy steadfast love and thy faithfulness;
PSA.138.2	for thou hast exalted above everything
PSA.138.2	thy name and thy word.
PSA.138.3	On the day I called, thou didst answer me,
PSA.138.3	my strength of soul thou didst increase.
PSA.138.4	All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O 
PSA.138.4	for they have heard the words of thy mouth;
PSA.138.5	and they shall sing of the ways of the 
PSA.138.5	for great is the glory of the 
PSA.138.6	For though the 
PSA.138.6	but the haughty he knows from afar.
PSA.138.7	Though I walk in the midst of trouble,
PSA.138.7	thou dost preserve my life;
PSA.138.7	thou dost stretch out thy hand against the wrath of my enemies,
PSA.138.7	and thy right hand delivers me.
PSA.138.8	The 
PSA.138.8	thy steadfast love, O 
PSA.138.8	Do not forsake the work of thy hands.
PSA.139.1	O 
PSA.139.2	Thou knowest when I sit down and when I rise up;
PSA.139.2	thou discernest my thoughts from afar.
PSA.139.3	Thou searchest out my path and my lying down,
PSA.139.3	and art acquainted with all my ways.
PSA.139.4	Even before a word is on my tongue,
PSA.139.4	lo, O 
PSA.139.5	Thou dost beset me behind and before,
PSA.139.5	and layest thy hand upon me.
PSA.139.6	Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;
PSA.139.6	it is high, I cannot attain it.
PSA.139.7	Whither shall I go from thy Spirit?
PSA.139.7	Or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
PSA.139.8	If I ascend to heaven, thou art there!
PSA.139.8	If I make my bed in Sheol, thou art there!
PSA.139.9	If I take the wings of the morning
PSA.139.9	and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
PSA.139.10	even there thy hand shall lead me,
PSA.139.10	and thy right hand shall hold me.
PSA.139.11	If I say, “Let only darkness cover me,
PSA.139.11	and the light about me be night,”
PSA.139.12	even the darkness is not dark to thee,
PSA.139.12	the night is bright as the day;
PSA.139.12	for darkness is as light with thee.
PSA.139.13	For thou didst form my inward parts,
PSA.139.13	thou didst knit me together in my mother's womb.
PSA.139.14	I praise thee, for thou art fearful and wonderful.
PSA.139.14	Wonderful are thy works!
PSA.139.14	Thou knowest me right well;
PSA.139.15	my frame was not hidden from thee,
PSA.139.15	when I was being made in secret,
PSA.139.15	intricately wrought in the depths of the earth.
PSA.139.16	Thy eyes beheld my unformed substance;
PSA.139.16	in thy book were written, every one of them,
PSA.139.16	the days that were formed for me,
PSA.139.16	when as yet there was none of them.
PSA.139.17	How precious to me are thy thoughts, O God!
PSA.139.17	How vast is the sum of them!
PSA.139.18	If I would count them, they are more than the sand.
PSA.139.18	When I awake, I am still with thee.
PSA.139.19	O that thou wouldst slay the wicked, O God,
PSA.139.19	and that men of blood would depart from me,
PSA.139.20	men who maliciously defy thee,
PSA.139.20	who lift themselves up against thee for evil!
PSA.139.21	Do I not hate them that hate thee, O 
PSA.139.21	And do I not loathe them that rise up against thee?
PSA.139.22	I hate them with perfect hatred;
PSA.139.22	I count them my enemies.
PSA.139.23	Search me, O God, and know my heart!
PSA.139.23	Try me and know my thoughts!
PSA.139.24	And see if there be any wicked
PSA.139.24	and lead me in the way everlasting!
PSA.140.1	Deliver me, O 
PSA.140.1	preserve me from violent men,
PSA.140.2	who plan evil things in their heart,
PSA.140.2	and stir up wars continually.
PSA.140.3	and under their lips is the poison of vipers. 
PSA.140.4	Guard me, O 
PSA.140.4	preserve me from violent men,
PSA.140.4	who have planned to trip up my feet.
PSA.140.5	Arrogant men have hidden a trap for me,
PSA.140.5	and with cords they have spread a net,
PSA.140.5	by the wayside they have set snares for me. 
PSA.140.6	I say to the 
PSA.140.6	give ear to the voice of my supplications, O 
PSA.140.7	O 
PSA.140.7	thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.
PSA.140.8	Grant not, O 
PSA.140.8	do not further his evil plot! 
PSA.140.9	Those who surround me lift up their head,
PSA.140.9	let the mischief of their lips overwhelm them!
PSA.140.10	Let burning coals fall upon them!
PSA.140.10	Let them be cast into pits, no more to rise!
PSA.140.11	Let not the slanderer be established in the land;
PSA.140.11	let evil hunt down the violent man speedily!
PSA.140.12	I know that the 
PSA.140.12	and executes justice for the needy.
PSA.140.13	Surely the righteous shall give thanks to thy name;
PSA.140.13	the upright shall dwell in thy presence.
PSA.141.1	I call upon thee, O 
PSA.141.1	Give ear to my voice, when I call to thee!
PSA.141.2	and the lifting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice!
PSA.141.3	Set a guard over my mouth, O 
PSA.141.3	keep watch over the door of my lips!
PSA.141.4	Incline not my heart to any evil,
PSA.141.4	to busy myself with wicked deeds
PSA.141.4	in company with men who work iniquity;
PSA.141.4	and let me not eat of their dainties!
PSA.141.5	Let a good man strike or rebuke me in kindness,
PSA.141.5	but let the oil of the wicked never anoint my head;
PSA.141.5	for my prayer is continually
PSA.141.6	When they are given over to those who shall condemn them,
PSA.141.6	then they shall learn that the word of the 
PSA.141.7	As a rock which one cleaves and shatters on the land,
PSA.141.7	so shall their bones be strewn at the mouth of Sheol.
PSA.141.8	But my eyes are toward thee, O 
PSA.141.8	in thee I seek refuge; leave me not defenseless!
PSA.141.9	Keep me from the trap which they have laid for me,
PSA.141.9	and from the snares of evildoers!
PSA.141.10	Let the wicked together fall into their own nets,
PSA.141.10	while I escape.
PSA.142.1	I cry with my voice to the 
PSA.142.1	with my voice I make supplication to the 
PSA.142.2	I pour out my complaint before him,
PSA.142.2	I tell my trouble before him.
PSA.142.3	When my spirit is faint,
PSA.142.3	thou knowest my way!
PSA.142.3	In the path where I walk
PSA.142.3	they have hidden a trap for me.
PSA.142.4	I look to the right and watch,
PSA.142.4	but there is none who takes notice of me;
PSA.142.4	no refuge remains to me,
PSA.142.4	no man cares for me.
PSA.142.5	I cry to thee, O 
PSA.142.5	I say, Thou art my refuge,
PSA.142.5	my portion in the land of the living.
PSA.142.6	Give heed to my cry;
PSA.142.6	for I am brought very low!
PSA.142.6	Deliver me from my persecutors;
PSA.142.6	for they are too strong for me!
PSA.142.7	Bring me out of prison,
PSA.142.7	that I may give thanks to thy name!
PSA.142.7	The righteous will surround me;
PSA.142.7	for thou wilt deal bountifully with me.
PSA.143.1	Hear my prayer, O 
PSA.143.1	give ear to my supplications!
PSA.143.1	In thy faithfulness answer me, in thy righteousness!
PSA.143.2	for no man living is righteous before thee.
PSA.143.3	For the enemy has pursued me;
PSA.143.3	he has crushed my life to the ground;
PSA.143.3	he has made me sit in darkness like those long dead.
PSA.143.4	Therefore my spirit faints within me;
PSA.143.4	my heart within me is appalled.
PSA.143.5	I remember the days of old,
PSA.143.5	I meditate on all that thou hast done;
PSA.143.5	I muse on what thy hands have wrought.
PSA.143.6	I stretch out my hands to thee;
PSA.143.6	my soul thirsts for thee like a parched land. 
PSA.143.7	Make haste to answer me, O 
PSA.143.7	My spirit fails!
PSA.143.7	Hide not thy face from me,
PSA.143.7	lest I be like those who go down to the Pit.
PSA.143.8	Let me hear in the morning of thy steadfast love,
PSA.143.8	for in thee I put my trust.
PSA.143.8	Teach me the way I should go,
PSA.143.8	for to thee I lift up my soul.
PSA.143.9	Deliver me, O 
PSA.143.9	I have fled to thee for refuge!
PSA.143.10	Teach me to do thy will,
PSA.143.10	for thou art my God!
PSA.143.10	Let thy good spirit lead me
PSA.143.10	on a level path!
PSA.143.11	For thy name's sake, O 
PSA.143.11	In thy righteousness bring me out of trouble!
PSA.143.12	And in thy steadfast love cut off my enemies,
PSA.143.12	and destroy all my adversaries,
PSA.143.12	for I am thy servant.
PSA.144.1	Blessed be the 
PSA.144.1	who trains my hands for war,
PSA.144.1	and my fingers for battle;
PSA.144.2	my rock
PSA.144.2	my stronghold and my deliverer,
PSA.144.2	my shield and he in whom I take refuge,
PSA.144.2	who subdues the peoples under him.
PSA.144.3	O 
PSA.144.3	or the son of man that thou dost think of him?
PSA.144.4	Man is like a breath,
PSA.144.4	his days are like a passing shadow.
PSA.144.5	Bow thy heavens, O 
PSA.144.5	Touch the mountains that they smoke!
PSA.144.6	Flash forth the lightning and scatter them,
PSA.144.6	send out thy arrows and rout them!
PSA.144.7	Stretch forth thy hand from on high,
PSA.144.7	rescue me and deliver me from the many waters,
PSA.144.7	from the hand of aliens,
PSA.144.8	whose mouths speak lies,
PSA.144.8	and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
PSA.144.9	I will sing a new song to thee, O God;
PSA.144.9	upon a ten-stringed harp I will play to thee,
PSA.144.10	who givest victory to kings,
PSA.144.10	who rescuest David thy
PSA.144.11	Rescue me from the cruel sword,
PSA.144.11	and deliver me from the hand of aliens,
PSA.144.11	whose mouths speak lies,
PSA.144.11	and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
PSA.144.12	May our sons in their youth
PSA.144.12	be like plants full grown,
PSA.144.12	our daughters like corner pillars
PSA.144.12	cut for the structure of a palace;
PSA.144.13	may our garners be full,
PSA.144.13	providing all manner of store;
PSA.144.13	may our sheep bring forth thousands
PSA.144.13	and ten thousands in our fields;
PSA.144.14	may our cattle be heavy with young,
PSA.144.14	suffering no mischance or failure in bearing;
PSA.144.14	may there be no cry of distress in our streets!
PSA.144.15	Happy the people to whom such blessings fall!

PSA.145.2	and praise thy name for ever and ever.
PSA.145.3	Great is the 
PSA.145.3	and his greatness is unsearchable.
PSA.145.4	One generation shall laud thy works to another,
PSA.145.4	and shall declare thy mighty acts.
PSA.145.5	On the glorious splendor of thy majesty,
PSA.145.5	and on thy wondrous works, I will meditate.
PSA.145.6	Men shall proclaim the might of thy terrible acts,
PSA.145.6	and I will declare thy greatness.
PSA.145.7	They shall pour forth the fame of thy abundant goodness,
PSA.145.7	and shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.

PSA.145.10	All thy works shall give thanks to thee, O 
PSA.145.10	and all thy saints shall bless thee!
PSA.145.11	They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom,
PSA.145.11	and tell of thy power,
PSA.145.12	to make known to the sons of men thy
PSA.145.12	and the glorious splendor of thy
PSA.145.13	Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,
PSA.145.13	and thy dominion endures throughout all generations.
PSA.145.13	The

PSA.145.14	The 
PSA.145.14	and raises up all who are bowed down.
PSA.145.15	The eyes of all look to thee,
PSA.145.15	and thou givest them their food in due season.
PSA.145.16	Thou openest thy hand,
PSA.145.16	thou satisfiest the desire of every living thing.
PSA.145.17	The 
PSA.145.17	and kind in all his doings.
PSA.145.18	The

PSA.146.3	Put not your trust in princes,
PSA.146.3	in a son of man, in whom there is no help.
PSA.146.4	When his breath departs he returns to his earth;
PSA.146.4	on that very day his plans perish.
PSA.146.5	Happy is he whose help is the God of Jacob,
PSA.146.5	whose hope is in the 
PSA.146.6	who made heaven and earth,
PSA.146.6	the sea, and all that is in them;
PSA.146.6	who keeps faith for ever;

PSA.147.9	He gives to the beasts their food,
PSA.147.9	and to the young ravens which cry.
PSA.147.10	His delight is not in the strength of the horse,

PSA.147.14	he fills you with the finest of the wheat.
PSA.147.15	He sends forth his command to the earth;
PSA.147.15	his word runs swiftly.
PSA.147.16	He gives snow like wool;
PSA.147.16	he scatters hoarfrost like ashes.
PSA.147.17	He casts forth his ice like morsels;
PSA.147.17	who can stand before his cold?
PSA.147.18	He sends forth his word, and melts them;
PSA.147.18	he makes his wind blow, and the waters flow.
PSA.147.19	He declares his word to Jacob,
PSA.147.19	his statutes and ordinances to Israel.

PSA.149.5	let them sing for joy on their couches.
PSA.149.6	Let the high praises of God be in their throats
PSA.149.6	and two-edged swords in their hands,
PSA.149.7	to wreak vengeance on the nations
PSA.149.7	and chastisement on the peoples,
PSA.149.8	to bind their kings with chains
PSA.149.8	and their nobles with fetters of iron,

PSA.150.5	praise him with loud clashing cymbals!
PSA.150.6	Let everything that breathes praise the 
PSA.150.6	Praise the 
PRO.1.1	The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:
PRO.1.2	That men may know wisdom and instruction,
PRO.1.2	understand words of insight,
PRO.1.3	receive instruction in wise dealing,
PRO.1.3	righteousness, justice, and equity;
PRO.1.4	that prudence may be given to the simple,
PRO.1.4	knowledge and discretion to the youth—
PRO.1.5	the wise man also may hear and increase in learning,
PRO.1.5	and the man of understanding acquire skill,
PRO.1.6	to understand a proverb and a figure,
PRO.1.6	the words of the wise and their riddles.
PRO.1.7	The fear of the 
PRO.1.7	fools despise wisdom and instruction.
PRO.1.8	Hear, my son, your father's instruction,
PRO.1.8	and reject not your mother's teaching;
PRO.1.9	for they are a fair garland for your head,
PRO.1.9	and pendants for your neck.
PRO.1.10	My son, if sinners entice you,
PRO.1.10	do not consent.
PRO.1.11	If they say, “Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood,
PRO.1.11	let us wantonly ambush the innocent;
PRO.1.12	like Sheol let us swallow them alive
PRO.1.12	and whole, like those who go down to the Pit:
PRO.1.13	we shall find all precious goods,
PRO.1.13	we shall fill our houses with spoil;
PRO.1.14	throw in your lot among us,
PRO.1.14	we will all have one purse”—
PRO.1.15	my son, do not walk in the way with them,
PRO.1.15	hold back your foot from their paths;
PRO.1.16	for their feet run to evil,
PRO.1.16	and they make haste to shed blood.
PRO.1.17	For in vain is a net spread
PRO.1.17	in the sight of any bird;
PRO.1.18	but these men lie in wait for their own blood,
PRO.1.18	they set an ambush for their own lives.
PRO.1.19	Such are the ways of all who get gain by violence;
PRO.1.19	it takes away the life of its possessors.
PRO.1.20	in the markets she raises her voice;
PRO.1.21	on the top of the walls
PRO.1.21	at the entrance of the city gates she speaks:
PRO.1.22	“How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple?
PRO.1.22	How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing
PRO.1.22	and fools hate knowledge?
PRO.1.23	Give heed
PRO.1.23	behold, I will pour out my thoughts
PRO.1.23	I will make my words known to you.
PRO.1.24	Because I have called and you refused to listen,
PRO.1.24	have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded,
PRO.1.25	and you have ignored all my counsel
PRO.1.25	and would have none of my reproof,
PRO.1.26	I also will laugh at your calamity;
PRO.1.26	I will mock when panic strikes you,
PRO.1.27	when panic strikes you like a storm,
PRO.1.27	and your calamity comes like a whirlwind,
PRO.1.27	when distress and anguish come upon you.
PRO.1.28	Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer;
PRO.1.28	they will seek me diligently but will not find me.
PRO.1.29	Because they hated knowledge
PRO.1.29	and did not choose the fear of the 
PRO.1.30	would have none of my counsel,
PRO.1.30	and despised all my reproof,
PRO.1.31	therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way
PRO.1.31	and be sated with their own devices.
PRO.1.32	For the simple are killed by their turning away,
PRO.1.32	and the complacence of fools destroys them;
PRO.1.33	but he who listens to me will dwell secure
PRO.1.33	and will be at ease, without dread of evil.”
PRO.2.1	My son, if you receive my words
PRO.2.1	and treasure up my commandments with you,
PRO.2.2	making your ear attentive to wisdom
PRO.2.2	and inclining your heart to understanding;
PRO.2.3	yes, if you cry out for insight
PRO.2.3	and raise your voice for understanding,
PRO.2.4	if you seek it like silver
PRO.2.4	and search for it as for hidden treasures;
PRO.2.5	then you will understand the fear of the 
PRO.2.5	and find the knowledge of God.
PRO.2.6	For the 
PRO.2.6	from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;
PRO.2.7	he stores up sound wisdom for the upright;
PRO.2.7	he is a shield to those who walk in integrity,
PRO.2.8	guarding the paths of justice
PRO.2.8	and preserving the way of his saints.
PRO.2.9	Then you will understand righteousness and justice
PRO.2.9	and equity, every good path;
PRO.2.10	for wisdom will come into your heart,
PRO.2.10	and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;
PRO.2.11	discretion will watch over you;
PRO.2.11	understanding will guard you;
PRO.2.12	delivering you from the way of evil,
PRO.2.12	from men of perverted speech,
PRO.2.13	who forsake the paths of uprightness
PRO.2.13	to walk in the ways of darkness,
PRO.2.14	who rejoice in doing evil
PRO.2.14	and delight in the perverseness of evil;
PRO.2.15	men whose paths are crooked,
PRO.2.15	and who are devious in their ways.
PRO.2.16	You will be saved from the loose
PRO.2.16	from the adventuress
PRO.2.17	who forsakes the companion of her youth
PRO.2.17	and forgets the covenant of her God;
PRO.2.18	for her house sinks down to death,
PRO.2.18	and her paths to the shades;
PRO.2.19	none who go to her come back
PRO.2.19	nor do they regain the paths of life.
PRO.2.20	So you will walk in the way of good men
PRO.2.20	and keep to the paths of the righteous.
PRO.2.21	For the upright will inhabit the land,
PRO.2.21	and men of integrity will remain in it;
PRO.2.22	but the wicked will be cut off from the land,
PRO.2.22	and the treacherous will be rooted out of it.
PRO.3.1	My son, do not forget my teaching,
PRO.3.1	but let your heart keep my commandments;
PRO.3.2	for length of days and years of life
PRO.3.2	and abundant welfare will they give you.
PRO.3.3	Let not loyalty and faithfulness forsake you;
PRO.3.3	bind them about your neck,
PRO.3.3	write them on the tablet of your heart.
PRO.3.4	in the sight of God and man.
PRO.3.5	Trust in the 
PRO.3.5	and do not rely on your own insight.
PRO.3.6	In all your ways acknowledge him,
PRO.3.6	and he will make straight your paths.
PRO.3.7	fear the 
PRO.3.8	It will be healing to your flesh
PRO.3.8	and refreshment
PRO.3.9	Honor the 
PRO.3.9	and with the first fruits of all your produce;
PRO.3.10	then your barns will be filled with plenty,
PRO.3.10	and your vats will be bursting with wine.
PRO.3.11	or be weary of his reproof,
PRO.3.12	for the 
PRO.3.12	as a father the son in whom he delights.
PRO.3.13	Happy is the man who finds wisdom,
PRO.3.13	and the man who gets understanding,
PRO.3.14	for the gain from it is better than gain from silver
PRO.3.14	and its profit better than gold.
PRO.3.15	She is more precious than jewels,
PRO.3.15	and nothing you desire can compare with her.
PRO.3.16	Long life is in her right hand;
PRO.3.16	in her left hand are riches and honor.
PRO.3.17	Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
PRO.3.17	and all her paths are peace.
PRO.3.18	She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her;
PRO.3.18	those who hold her fast are called happy.
PRO.3.19	The 
PRO.3.19	by understanding he established the heavens;
PRO.3.20	by his knowledge the deeps broke forth,
PRO.3.20	and the clouds drop down the dew.
PRO.3.21	My son, keep sound wisdom and discretion;
PRO.3.21	let them not escape from your sight,
PRO.3.22	and they will be life for your soul
PRO.3.22	and adornment for your neck.
PRO.3.23	Then you will walk on your way securely
PRO.3.23	and your foot will not stumble.
PRO.3.24	If you sit down,
PRO.3.24	when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.
PRO.3.25	Do not be afraid of sudden panic,
PRO.3.25	or of the ruin
PRO.3.26	for the 
PRO.3.26	and will keep your foot from being caught.
PRO.3.27	Do not withhold good from those to whom it
PRO.3.27	when it is in your power to do it.
PRO.3.28	Do not say to your neighbor, “Go, and come again,
PRO.3.28	tomorrow I will give it”—when you have it with you.
PRO.3.29	Do not plan evil against your neighbor
PRO.3.29	who dwells trustingly beside you.
PRO.3.30	Do not contend with a man for no reason,
PRO.3.30	when he has done you no harm.
PRO.3.31	Do not envy a man of violence
PRO.3.31	and do not choose any of his ways;
PRO.3.32	for the perverse man is an abomination to the 
PRO.3.32	but the upright are in his confidence.
PRO.3.33	The 
PRO.3.33	but he blesses the abode of the righteous.
PRO.3.34	but to the humble he shows favor.
PRO.3.35	The wise will inherit honor,
PRO.3.35	but fools get
PRO.4.1	Hear, O sons, a father's instruction,
PRO.4.1	and be attentive, that you may gain
PRO.4.2	for I give you good precepts:
PRO.4.2	do not forsake my teaching.
PRO.4.3	When I was a son with my father,
PRO.4.3	tender, the only one in the sight of my mother,
PRO.4.4	he taught me, and said to me,
PRO.4.4	“Let your heart hold fast my words;
PRO.4.4	keep my commandments, and live;
PRO.4.5	do not forget, and do not turn away from the words of my mouth.
PRO.4.5	Get wisdom; get insight.
PRO.4.6	Do not forsake her, and she will keep you;
PRO.4.6	love her, and she will guard you.
PRO.4.7	The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom,
PRO.4.7	and whatever you get, get insight.
PRO.4.8	Prize her highly,
PRO.4.8	she will honor you if you embrace her.
PRO.4.9	She will place on your head a fair garland;
PRO.4.9	she will bestow on you a beautiful crown.”
PRO.4.10	Hear, my son, and accept my words,
PRO.4.10	that the years of your life may be many.
PRO.4.11	I have taught you the way of wisdom;
PRO.4.11	I have led you in the paths of uprightness.
PRO.4.12	When you walk, your step will not be hampered;
PRO.4.12	and if you run, you will not stumble.
PRO.4.13	Keep hold of instruction, do not let go;
PRO.4.13	guard her, for she is your life.
PRO.4.14	Do not enter the path of the wicked,
PRO.4.14	and do not walk in the way of evil men.
PRO.4.15	Avoid it; do not go on it;
PRO.4.15	turn away from it and pass on.
PRO.4.16	For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong;
PRO.4.16	they are robbed of sleep unless they have made some one stumble.
PRO.4.17	For they eat the bread of wickedness
PRO.4.17	and drink the wine of violence.
PRO.4.18	But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn,
PRO.4.18	which shines brighter and brighter until full day.
PRO.4.19	The way of the wicked is like deep darkness;
PRO.4.19	they do not know over what they stumble.
PRO.4.20	My son, be attentive to my words;
PRO.4.20	incline your ear to my sayings.
PRO.4.21	Let them not escape from your sight;
PRO.4.21	keep them within your heart.
PRO.4.22	For they are life to him who finds them,
PRO.4.22	and healing to all his flesh.
PRO.4.23	Keep your heart with all vigilance;
PRO.4.23	for from it flow the springs of life.
PRO.4.24	Put away from you crooked speech,
PRO.4.24	and put devious talk far from you.
PRO.4.25	Let your eyes look directly forward,
PRO.4.25	and your gaze be straight before you.
PRO.4.26	then all your ways will be sure.
PRO.4.27	Do not swerve to the right or to the left;
PRO.4.27	turn your foot away from evil.
PRO.5.1	My son, be attentive to my wisdom,
PRO.5.1	incline your ear to my understanding;
PRO.5.2	that you may keep discretion,
PRO.5.2	and your lips may guard knowledge.
PRO.5.3	For the lips of a loose woman drip honey,
PRO.5.3	and her speech
PRO.5.4	but in the end she is bitter as wormwood,
PRO.5.4	sharp as a two-edged sword.
PRO.5.5	Her feet go down to death;
PRO.5.5	her steps follow the path to
PRO.5.6	she does not take heed to
PRO.5.6	her ways wander, and she does not know it.
PRO.5.7	And now, O sons, listen to me,
PRO.5.7	and do not depart from the words of my mouth.
PRO.5.8	Keep your way far from her,
PRO.5.8	and do not go near the door of her house;
PRO.5.9	lest you give your honor to others
PRO.5.9	and your years to the merciless;
PRO.5.10	lest strangers take their fill of your strength,
PRO.5.10	and your labors go to the house of an alien;
PRO.5.11	and at the end of your life you groan,
PRO.5.11	when your flesh and body are consumed,
PRO.5.12	and you say, “How I hated discipline,
PRO.5.12	and my heart despised reproof!
PRO.5.13	I did not listen to the voice of my teachers
PRO.5.13	or incline my ear to my instructors.
PRO.5.14	I was at the point of utter ruin
PRO.5.14	in the assembled congregation.”
PRO.5.15	Drink water from your own cistern,
PRO.5.15	flowing water from your own well.
PRO.5.16	Should your springs be scattered abroad,
PRO.5.16	streams of water in the streets?
PRO.5.17	Let them be for yourself alone,
PRO.5.17	and not for strangers with you.
PRO.5.18	Let your fountain be blessed,
PRO.5.18	and rejoice in the wife of your youth,
PRO.5.19	a lovely hind, a graceful doe.
PRO.5.19	Let her affection fill you at all times with delight,
PRO.5.19	be infatuated always with her love.
PRO.5.20	Why should you be infatuated, my son, with a loose woman
PRO.5.20	and embrace the bosom of an adventuress?
PRO.5.21	For a man's ways are before the eyes of the 
PRO.5.21	and he watches
PRO.5.22	The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him,
PRO.5.22	and he is caught in the toils of his sin.
PRO.5.23	He dies for lack of discipline,
PRO.5.23	and because of his great folly he is lost.
PRO.6.1	My son, if you have become surety for your neighbor,
PRO.6.1	have given your pledge for a stranger;
PRO.6.2	if you are snared in the utterance of your lips,
PRO.6.2	caught in the words of your mouth;
PRO.6.3	then do this, my son, and save yourself,
PRO.6.3	for you have come into your neighbor's power:
PRO.6.3	go, hasten,
PRO.6.4	Give your eyes no sleep
PRO.6.4	and your eyelids no slumber;
PRO.6.5	save yourself like a gazelle from the hunter,
PRO.6.5	like a bird from the hand of the fowler.
PRO.6.6	Go to the ant, O sluggard;
PRO.6.6	consider her ways, and be wise.
PRO.6.7	Without having any chief,
PRO.6.7	officer or ruler,
PRO.6.8	she prepares her food in summer,
PRO.6.8	and gathers her sustenance in harvest.
PRO.6.9	How long will you lie there, O sluggard?
PRO.6.9	When will you arise from your sleep?
PRO.6.10	A little sleep, a little slumber,
PRO.6.10	a little folding of the hands to rest,
PRO.6.11	and poverty will come upon you like a vagabond,
PRO.6.11	and want like an armed man.
PRO.6.12	A worthless person, a wicked man,
PRO.6.12	goes about with crooked speech,
PRO.6.13	winks with his eyes, scrapes
PRO.6.13	points with his finger,
PRO.6.14	with perverted heart devises evil,
PRO.6.14	continually sowing discord;
PRO.6.15	therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly;
PRO.6.15	in a moment he will be broken beyond healing.
PRO.6.16	There are six things which the 
PRO.6.16	seven which are an abomination to him:
PRO.6.17	haughty eyes, a lying tongue,
PRO.6.17	and hands that shed innocent blood,
PRO.6.18	a heart that devises wicked plans,
PRO.6.18	feet that make haste to run to evil,
PRO.6.19	a false witness who breathes out lies,
PRO.6.19	and a man who sows discord among brothers.
PRO.6.20	My son, keep your father's commandment,
PRO.6.20	and forsake not your mother's teaching.
PRO.6.21	Bind them upon your heart always;
PRO.6.21	tie them about your neck.
PRO.6.22	When you walk, they
PRO.6.22	when you lie down, they
PRO.6.22	and when you awake, they
PRO.6.23	For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light,
PRO.6.23	and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life,
PRO.6.24	to preserve you from the evil woman,
PRO.6.24	from the smooth tongue of the adventuress.
PRO.6.25	Do not desire her beauty in your heart,
PRO.6.25	and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes;
PRO.6.26	for a harlot may be hired for a loaf of bread,
PRO.6.26	but an adulteress
PRO.6.27	Can a man carry fire in his bosom
PRO.6.27	and his clothes not be burned?
PRO.6.28	Or can one walk upon hot coals
PRO.6.28	and his feet not be scorched?
PRO.6.29	So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife;
PRO.6.29	none who touches her will go unpunished.
PRO.6.30	Do not men despise
PRO.6.30	to satisfy his appetite when he is hungry?
PRO.6.31	And if he is caught, he will pay sevenfold;
PRO.6.31	he will give all the goods of his house.
PRO.6.32	He who commits adultery has no sense;
PRO.6.32	he who does it destroys himself.
PRO.6.33	Wounds and dishonor will he get,
PRO.6.33	and his disgrace will not be wiped away.
PRO.6.34	For jealousy makes a man furious,
PRO.6.34	and he will not spare when he takes revenge.
PRO.6.35	He will accept no compensation,
PRO.6.35	nor be appeased though you multiply gifts.
PRO.7.1	My son, keep my words
PRO.7.1	and treasure up my commandments with you;
PRO.7.2	keep my commandments and live,
PRO.7.2	keep my teachings as the apple of your eye;
PRO.7.3	bind them on your fingers,
PRO.7.3	write them on the tablet of your heart.
PRO.7.4	Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”
PRO.7.4	and call insight your intimate friend;
PRO.7.5	to preserve you from the loose woman,
PRO.7.5	from the adventuress with her smooth words.
PRO.7.6	For at the window of my house
PRO.7.6	I have looked out through my lattice,
PRO.7.7	and I have seen among the simple,
PRO.7.7	I have perceived among the youths,
PRO.7.7	a young man without sense,
PRO.7.8	passing along the street near her corner,
PRO.7.8	taking the road to her house
PRO.7.9	in the twilight, in the evening,
PRO.7.9	at the time of night and darkness.
PRO.7.10	And lo, a woman meets him,
PRO.7.10	dressed as a harlot, wily of heart.
PRO.7.11	She is loud and wayward,
PRO.7.11	her feet do not stay at home;
PRO.7.12	now in the street, now in the market,
PRO.7.12	and at every corner she lies in wait.
PRO.7.13	She seizes him and kisses him,
PRO.7.13	and with impudent face she says to him:
PRO.7.14	“I had to offer sacrifices,
PRO.7.14	and today I have paid my vows;
PRO.7.15	so now I have come out to meet you,
PRO.7.15	to seek you eagerly, and I have found you.
PRO.7.16	I have decked my couch with coverings,
PRO.7.16	colored spreads of Egyptian linen;
PRO.7.17	I have perfumed my bed with myrrh,
PRO.7.17	aloes, and cinnamon.
PRO.7.18	Come, let us take our fill of love till morning;
PRO.7.18	let us delight ourselves with love.
PRO.7.19	For my husband is not at home;
PRO.7.19	he has gone on a long journey;
PRO.7.20	he took a bag of money with him;
PRO.7.20	at full moon he will come home.”
PRO.7.21	With much seductive speech she persuades him;
PRO.7.21	with her smooth talk she compels him.
PRO.7.22	All at once he follows her,
PRO.7.22	as an ox goes to the slaughter,
PRO.7.22	or as a stag is caught fast
PRO.7.23	till an arrow pierces its entrails;
PRO.7.23	as a bird rushes into a snare;
PRO.7.23	he does not know that it will cost him his life.
PRO.7.24	And now, O sons, listen to me,
PRO.7.24	and be attentive to the words of my mouth.
PRO.7.25	Let not your heart turn aside to her ways,
PRO.7.25	do not stray into her paths;
PRO.7.26	for many a victim has she laid low;
PRO.7.26	yea, all her slain are a mighty host.
PRO.7.27	Her house is the way to Sheol,
PRO.7.27	going down to the chambers of death.
PRO.8.1	Does not understanding raise her voice?
PRO.8.2	On the heights beside the way,
PRO.8.2	in the paths she takes her stand;
PRO.8.3	beside the gates in front of the town,
PRO.8.3	at the entrance of the portals she cries aloud:
PRO.8.4	“To you, O men, I call,
PRO.8.4	and my cry is to the sons of men.
PRO.8.5	O simple ones, learn prudence;
PRO.8.5	O foolish men, pay attention.
PRO.8.6	Hear, for I will speak noble things,
PRO.8.6	and from my lips will come what is right;
PRO.8.7	for my mouth will utter truth;
PRO.8.7	wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
PRO.8.8	All the words of my mouth are righteous;
PRO.8.8	there is nothing twisted or crooked in them.
PRO.8.9	They are all straight to him who understands
PRO.8.9	and right to those who find knowledge.
PRO.8.10	Take my instruction instead of silver,
PRO.8.10	and knowledge rather than choice gold;
PRO.8.11	for wisdom is better than jewels,
PRO.8.11	and all that you may desire cannot compare with her.
PRO.8.12	I, wisdom, dwell in prudence,
PRO.8.12	and I find knowledge and discretion.
PRO.8.13	The fear of the 
PRO.8.13	Pride and arrogance and the way of evil
PRO.8.13	and perverted speech I hate.
PRO.8.14	I have counsel and sound wisdom,
PRO.8.14	I have insight, I have strength.
PRO.8.15	By me kings reign,
PRO.8.15	and rulers decree what is just;
PRO.8.16	by me princes rule,
PRO.8.16	and nobles govern
PRO.8.17	I love those who love me,
PRO.8.17	and those who seek me diligently find me.
PRO.8.18	Riches and honor are with me,
PRO.8.18	enduring wealth and prosperity.
PRO.8.19	My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold,
PRO.8.19	and my yield than choice silver.
PRO.8.20	I walk in the way of righteousness,
PRO.8.20	in the paths of justice,
PRO.8.21	endowing with wealth those who love me,
PRO.8.21	and filling their treasuries.
PRO.8.22	The 
PRO.8.22	the first of his acts of old.
PRO.8.23	Ages ago I was set up,
PRO.8.23	at the first, before the beginning of the earth.
PRO.8.24	When there were no depths I was brought forth,
PRO.8.24	when there were no springs abounding with water.
PRO.8.25	Before the mountains had been shaped,
PRO.8.25	before the hills, I was brought forth;
PRO.8.26	before he had made the earth with its fields,
PRO.8.26	or the first of the dust
PRO.8.27	When he established the heavens, I was there,
PRO.8.27	when he drew a circle on the face of the deep,
PRO.8.28	when he made firm the skies above,
PRO.8.28	when he established
PRO.8.29	when he assigned to the sea its limit,
PRO.8.29	so that the waters might not transgress his command,
PRO.8.29	when he marked out the foundations of the earth,
PRO.8.30	then I was beside him, like a master workman;
PRO.8.30	and I was daily his
PRO.8.30	rejoicing before him always,
PRO.8.31	rejoicing in his inhabited world
PRO.8.31	and delighting in the sons of men.
PRO.8.32	And now, my sons, listen to me:
PRO.8.32	happy are those who keep my ways.
PRO.8.33	Hear instruction and be wise,
PRO.8.33	and do not neglect it.
PRO.8.34	Happy is the man who listens to me,
PRO.8.34	watching daily at my gates,
PRO.8.34	waiting beside my doors.
PRO.8.35	For he who finds me finds life
PRO.8.35	and obtains favor from the 
PRO.8.36	but he who misses me injures himself;
PRO.8.36	all who hate me love death.”
PRO.9.1	Wisdom has built her house,
PRO.9.1	she has set up
PRO.9.2	She has slaughtered her beasts, she has mixed her wine,
PRO.9.2	she has also set her table.
PRO.9.3	She has sent out her maids to call
PRO.9.3	from the highest places in the town,
PRO.9.4	“Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”
PRO.9.4	To him who is without sense she says,
PRO.9.5	“Come, eat of my bread
PRO.9.5	and drink of the wine I have mixed.
PRO.9.6	Leave simpleness,
PRO.9.6	and walk in the way of insight.”
PRO.9.7	He who corrects a scoffer gets himself abuse,
PRO.9.7	and he who reproves a wicked man incurs injury.
PRO.9.8	Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you;
PRO.9.8	reprove a wise man, and he will love you.
PRO.9.9	Give instruction
PRO.9.9	teach a righteous man and he will increase in learning.
PRO.9.10	The fear of the 
PRO.9.10	and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight.
PRO.9.11	For by me your days will be multiplied,
PRO.9.11	and years will be added to your life.
PRO.9.12	If you are wise, you are wise for yourself;
PRO.9.12	if you scoff, you alone will bear it.
PRO.9.13	A foolish woman is noisy;
PRO.9.13	she is wanton
PRO.9.14	She sits at the door of her house,
PRO.9.14	she takes a seat on the high places of the town,
PRO.9.15	calling to those who pass by,
PRO.9.15	who are going straight on their way,
PRO.9.16	“Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”
PRO.9.16	And to him who is without sense she says,
PRO.9.17	“Stolen water is sweet,
PRO.9.17	and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.”
PRO.9.18	But he does not know that the dead
PRO.9.18	that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
PRO.10.1	The proverbs of Solomon.
PRO.10.1	A wise son makes a glad father,
PRO.10.1	but a foolish son is a sorrow to his mother.
PRO.10.2	Treasures gained by wickedness do not profit,
PRO.10.2	but righteousness delivers from death.
PRO.10.3	The 
PRO.10.3	but he thwarts the craving of the wicked.
PRO.10.4	A slack hand causes poverty,
PRO.10.4	but the hand of the diligent makes rich.
PRO.10.5	A son who gathers in summer is prudent,
PRO.10.5	but a son who sleeps in harvest brings shame.
PRO.10.6	Blessings are on the head of the righteous,
PRO.10.6	but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.
PRO.10.7	The memory of the righteous is a blessing,
PRO.10.7	but the name of the wicked will rot.
PRO.10.8	The wise of heart will heed commandments,
PRO.10.8	but a prating fool will come to ruin.
PRO.10.9	He who walks in integrity walks securely,
PRO.10.9	but he who perverts his ways will be found out.
PRO.10.10	He who winks the eye causes trouble,
PRO.10.10	but he who boldly reproves makes peace.
PRO.10.11	The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life,
PRO.10.11	but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.
PRO.10.12	but love covers all offenses.
PRO.10.13	On the lips of him who has understanding wisdom is found,
PRO.10.13	but a rod is for the back of him who lacks sense.
PRO.10.14	Wise men lay up knowledge,
PRO.10.14	but the babbling of a fool brings ruin near.
PRO.10.15	A rich man's wealth is his strong city;
PRO.10.15	the poverty of the poor is their ruin.
PRO.10.16	The wage of the righteous leads to life,
PRO.10.16	the gain of the wicked to sin.
PRO.10.17	He who heeds instruction is on the path to life,
PRO.10.17	but he who rejects reproof goes astray.
PRO.10.18	He who conceals hatred has lying lips,
PRO.10.18	and he who utters slander is a fool.
PRO.10.19	When words are many, transgression is not lacking,
PRO.10.19	but he who restrains his lips is prudent.
PRO.10.20	The tongue of the righteous is choice silver;
PRO.10.20	the mind of the wicked is of little worth.
PRO.10.21	The lips of the righteous feed many,
PRO.10.21	but fools die for lack of sense.
PRO.10.22	The blessing of the 
PRO.10.22	and he adds no sorrow with it.
PRO.10.23	It is like sport to a fool to do wrong,
PRO.10.23	but wise conduct is pleasure to a man of understanding.
PRO.10.24	What the wicked dreads will come upon him,
PRO.10.24	but the desire of the righteous will be granted.
PRO.10.25	When the tempest passes, the wicked is no more,
PRO.10.25	but the righteous is established for ever.
PRO.10.26	Like vinegar to the teeth, and smoke to the eyes,
PRO.10.26	so is the sluggard to those who send him.
PRO.10.27	The fear of the 
PRO.10.27	but the years of the wicked will be short.
PRO.10.28	The hope of the righteous ends in gladness,
PRO.10.28	but the expectation of the wicked comes to naught.
PRO.10.29	The 
PRO.10.29	but destruction to evildoers.
PRO.10.30	The righteous will never be removed,
PRO.10.30	but the wicked will not dwell in the land.
PRO.10.31	The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom,
PRO.10.31	but the perverse tongue will be cut off.
PRO.10.32	The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable,
PRO.10.32	but the mouth of the wicked, what is perverse.
PRO.11.1	A false balance is an abomination to the 
PRO.11.1	but a just weight is his delight.
PRO.11.2	When pride comes, then comes disgrace;
PRO.11.2	but with the humble is wisdom.
PRO.11.3	The integrity of the upright guides them,
PRO.11.3	but the crookedness of the treacherous destroys them.
PRO.11.4	Riches do not profit in the day of wrath,
PRO.11.4	but righteousness delivers from death.
PRO.11.5	The righteousness of the blameless keeps his way straight,
PRO.11.5	but the wicked falls by his own wickedness.
PRO.11.6	The righteousness of the upright delivers them,
PRO.11.6	but the treacherous are taken captive by their lust.
PRO.11.7	When the wicked dies, his hope perishes,
PRO.11.7	and the expectation of the godless comes to naught.
PRO.11.8	The righteous is delivered from trouble,
PRO.11.8	and the wicked gets into it instead.
PRO.11.9	With his mouth the godless man would destroy his neighbor,
PRO.11.9	but by knowledge the righteous are delivered.
PRO.11.10	When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices;
PRO.11.10	and when the wicked perish there are shouts of gladness.
PRO.11.11	By the blessing of the upright a city is exalted,
PRO.11.11	but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
PRO.11.12	He who belittles his neighbor lacks sense,
PRO.11.12	but a man of understanding remains silent.
PRO.11.13	He who goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets,
PRO.11.13	but he who is trustworthy in spirit keeps a thing hidden.
PRO.11.14	Where there is no guidance, a people falls;
PRO.11.14	but in an abundance of counselors there is safety.
PRO.11.15	He who gives surety for a stranger will smart for it,
PRO.11.15	but he who hates suretyship is secure.
PRO.11.16	A gracious woman gets honor,
PRO.11.16	and violent men get riches.
PRO.11.17	A man who is kind benefits himself,
PRO.11.17	but a cruel man hurts himself.
PRO.11.18	A wicked man earns deceptive wages,
PRO.11.18	but one who sows righteousness gets a sure reward.
PRO.11.19	He who is steadfast in righteousness will live,
PRO.11.19	but he who pursues evil will die.
PRO.11.20	Men of perverse mind are an abomination to the 
PRO.11.20	but those of blameless ways are his delight.
PRO.11.21	Be assured, an evil man will not go unpunished,
PRO.11.21	but those who are righteous will be delivered.
PRO.11.22	Like a gold ring in a swine's snout
PRO.11.22	is a beautiful woman without discretion.
PRO.11.23	The desire of the righteous ends only in good;
PRO.11.23	the expectation of the wicked in wrath.
PRO.11.24	One man gives freely, yet grows all the richer;
PRO.11.24	another withholds what he should give, and only suffers want.
PRO.11.25	A liberal man will be enriched,
PRO.11.25	and one who waters will himself be watered.
PRO.11.26	The people curse him who holds back grain,
PRO.11.26	but a blessing is on the head of him who sells it.
PRO.11.27	He who diligently seeks good seeks favor,
PRO.11.27	but evil comes to him who searches for it.
PRO.11.28	He who trusts in his riches will wither,
PRO.11.28	but the righteous will flourish like a green leaf.
PRO.11.29	He who troubles his household will inherit wind,
PRO.11.29	and the fool will be servant to the wise.
PRO.11.30	The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life,
PRO.11.30	but lawlessness
PRO.11.31	how much more the wicked and the sinner!
PRO.12.1	Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge,
PRO.12.1	but he who hates reproof is stupid.
PRO.12.2	A good man obtains favor from the 
PRO.12.2	but a man of evil devices he condemns.
PRO.12.3	A man is not established by wickedness,
PRO.12.3	but the root of the righteous will never be moved.
PRO.12.4	A good wife is the crown of her husband,
PRO.12.4	but she who brings shame is like rottenness in his bones.
PRO.12.5	The thoughts of the righteous are just;
PRO.12.5	the counsels of the wicked are treacherous.
PRO.12.6	The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood,
PRO.12.6	but the mouth of the upright delivers men.
PRO.12.7	The wicked are overthrown and are no more,
PRO.12.7	but the house of the righteous will stand.
PRO.12.8	A man is commended according to his good sense,
PRO.12.8	but one of perverse mind is despised.
PRO.12.9	Better is a man of humble standing who works for himself
PRO.12.9	than one who plays the great man but lacks bread.
PRO.12.10	A righteous man has regard for the life of his beast,
PRO.12.10	but the mercy of the wicked is cruel.
PRO.12.11	He who tills his land will have plenty of bread,
PRO.12.11	but he who follows worthless pursuits has no sense.
PRO.12.12	The strong tower of the wicked comes to ruin,
PRO.12.12	but the root of the righteous stands firm.
PRO.12.13	An evil man is ensnared by the transgression of his lips,
PRO.12.13	but the righteous escapes from trouble.
PRO.12.14	From the fruit of his words a man is satisfied with good,
PRO.12.14	and the work of a man's hand comes back to him.
PRO.12.15	The way of a fool is right in his own eyes,
PRO.12.15	but a wise man listens to advice.
PRO.12.16	The vexation of a fool is known at once,
PRO.12.16	but the prudent man ignores an insult.
PRO.12.17	He who speaks the truth gives honest evidence,
PRO.12.17	but a false witness utters deceit.
PRO.12.18	There is one whose rash words are like sword thrusts,
PRO.12.18	but the tongue of the wise brings healing.
PRO.12.19	Truthful lips endure for ever,
PRO.12.19	but a lying tongue is but for a moment.
PRO.12.20	Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil,
PRO.12.20	but those who plan good have joy.
PRO.12.21	No ill befalls the righteous,
PRO.12.21	but the wicked are filled with trouble.
PRO.12.22	Lying lips are an abomination to the 
PRO.12.22	but those who act faithfully are his delight.
PRO.12.23	A prudent man conceals his knowledge,
PRO.12.23	but fools

PRO.16.17	he who guards his way preserves his life.
PRO.16.18	Pride goes before destruction,
PRO.16.18	and a haughty spirit before a fall.

PRO.16.31	it is gained in a righteous life.
PRO.16.32	He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty,
PRO.16.32	and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city.
PRO.16.33	The lot is cast into the lap,
PRO.16.33	but the decision is wholly from the 
PRO.17.1	Better is a dry morsel with quiet
PRO.17.1	than a house full of feasting with strife.

PRO.17.7	still less is false speech to a prince.
PRO.17.8	A bribe is like a magic stone in the eyes of him who gives it;
PRO.17.8	wherever he turns he prospers.

PRO.17.9	but he who repeats a matter alienates a friend.
PRO.17.10	A rebuke goes deeper into a man of understanding
PRO.17.10	than a hundred blows into a fool.
PRO.17.11	An evil man seeks only rebellion,
PRO.17.11	and a cruel messenger will be sent against him.
PRO.17.12	Let a man meet a she-bear robbed of her cubs,
PRO.17.12	rather than a fool in his folly.
PRO.17.13	If a man returns evil for good,
PRO.17.13	evil will not depart from his house.
PRO.17.14	The beginning of strife is like letting out water;
PRO.17.14	so quit before the quarrel breaks out.
PRO.17.15	He who justifies the wicked and he who condemns the righteous
PRO.17.15	are both alike an abomination to the 
PRO.17.16	Why should a fool have a price in his hand to buy wisdom,
PRO.17.16	when he has no mind?
PRO.17.17	A friend loves at all times,
PRO.17.17	and a brother is born for adversity.

PRO.17.18	and becomes surety in the presence of his neighbor.
PRO.17.19	He who loves transgression loves strife;
PRO.17.19	he who makes his door high seeks destruction.
PRO.17.20	A man of crooked mind does not prosper,
PRO.17.20	and one with a perverse tongue falls into calamity.
PRO.17.21	A stupid son is a grief to a father;
PRO.17.21	and the father of a fool has no joy.
PRO.17.22	A cheerful heart is a good medicine,
PRO.17.22	but a downcast spirit dries up the bones.
PRO.17.23	A wicked man accepts a bribe from the bosom
PRO.17.23	to pervert the ways of justice.
PRO.17.24	A man of understanding sets his face toward wisdom,
PRO.17.24	but the eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth.
PRO.17.25	A foolish son is a grief to his father
PRO.17.25	and bitterness to her who bore him.
PRO.17.26	To impose a fine on a righteous man is not good;
PRO.17.26	to flog noble men is wrong.
PRO.17.27	He who restrains his words has knowledge,
PRO.17.27	and he who has a cool spirit is a man of understanding.
PRO.17.28	Even a fool who keeps silent is considered wise;
PRO.17.28	when he closes his lips, he is deemed intelligent.
PRO.18.1	He who is estranged
PRO.18.1	to break out against all sound judgment.
PRO.18.2	A fool takes no pleasure in understanding,
PRO.18.2	but only in expressing his opinion.
PRO.18.3	When wickedness comes, contempt comes also;
PRO.18.3	and with dishonor comes disgrace.
PRO.18.4	The words of a man's mouth are deep waters;
PRO.18.4	the fountain of wisdom is a gushing stream.
PRO.18.5	It is not good to be partial to a wicked man,
PRO.18.5	or to deprive a righteous man of justice.
PRO.18.6	A fool's lips bring strife,
PRO.18.6	and his mouth invites a flogging.
PRO.18.7	A fool's mouth is his ruin,
PRO.18.7	and his lips are a snare to himself.
PRO.18.8	The words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels;
PRO.18.8	they go down into the inner parts of the body.
PRO.18.9	He who is slack in his work
PRO.18.9	is a brother to him who destroys.
PRO.18.10	The name of the 
PRO.18.10	the righteous man runs into it and is safe.
PRO.18.11	A rich man's wealth is his strong city,
PRO.18.11	and like a high wall protecting him.
PRO.18.12	Before destruction a man's heart is haughty,
PRO.18.12	but humility goes before honor.
PRO.18.13	If one gives answer before he hears,
PRO.18.13	it is his folly and shame.
PRO.18.14	A man's spirit will endure sickness;
PRO.18.14	but a broken spirit who can bear?
PRO.18.15	An intelligent mind acquires knowledge,
PRO.18.15	and the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.
PRO.18.16	A man's gift makes room for him
PRO.18.16	and brings him before great men.
PRO.18.17	He who states his case first seems right,
PRO.18.17	until the other comes and examines him.
PRO.18.18	The lot puts an end to disputes
PRO.18.18	and decides between powerful contenders.
PRO.18.19	A brother helped is like a strong city,
PRO.18.19	but quarreling is like the bars of a castle.
PRO.18.20	From the fruit of his mouth a man is satisfied;
PRO.18.20	he is satisfied by the yield of his lips.
PRO.18.21	Death and life are in the power of the tongue,
PRO.18.21	and those who love it will eat its fruits.
PRO.18.22	He who finds a wife finds a good thing,
PRO.18.22	and obtains favor from the 
PRO.18.23	The poor use entreaties,
PRO.18.23	but the rich answer roughly.
PRO.18.24	There are
PRO.18.24	but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.
PRO.19.1	Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity
PRO.19.1	than a man who is perverse in speech, and is a fool.
PRO.19.2	It is not good for a man to be without knowledge,
PRO.19.2	and he who makes haste with his feet misses his way.
PRO.19.3	When a man's folly brings his way to ruin,
PRO.19.3	his heart rages against the 
PRO.19.4	Wealth brings many new friends,
PRO.19.4	but a poor man is deserted by his friend.
PRO.19.5	A false witness will not go unpunished,
PRO.19.5	and he who utters lies will not escape.
PRO.19.6	Many seek the favor of a generous man,
PRO.19.6	and every one is a friend to a man who gives gifts.
PRO.19.7	All a poor man's brothers hate him;
PRO.19.7	how much more do his friends go far from him!
PRO.19.7	He pursues them with words, but does not have them.
PRO.19.8	He who gets wisdom loves himself;
PRO.19.8	he who keeps understanding will prosper.
PRO.19.9	A false witness will not go unpunished,
PRO.19.9	and he who utters lies will perish.
PRO.19.10	It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury,
PRO.19.10	much less for a slave to rule over princes.
PRO.19.11	Good sense makes a man slow to anger,
PRO.19.11	and it is his glory to overlook an offense.
PRO.19.12	A king's wrath is like the growling of a lion,
PRO.19.12	but his favor is like dew upon the grass.
PRO.19.13	A foolish son is ruin to his father,
PRO.19.13	and a wife's quarreling is a continual dripping of rain.
PRO.19.14	House and wealth are inherited from fathers,
PRO.19.14	but a prudent wife is from the 
PRO.19.15	Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep,
PRO.19.15	and an idle person will suffer hunger.
PRO.19.16	He who keeps the commandment keeps his life;
PRO.19.16	he who despises the word
PRO.19.17	He who is kind to the poor lends to the 
PRO.19.17	and he will repay him for his deed.
PRO.19.18	Discipline your son while there is hope;
PRO.19.18	do not set your heart on his destruction.
PRO.19.19	A man of great wrath will pay the penalty;
PRO.19.19	for if you deliver him, you will only have to do it again.
PRO.19.20	Listen to advice and accept instruction,
PRO.19.20	that you may gain wisdom for the future.
PRO.19.21	Many are the plans in the mind of a man,
PRO.19.21	but it is the purpose of the 
PRO.19.22	What is desired in a man is loyalty,
PRO.19.22	and a poor man is better than a liar.
PRO.19.23	The fear of the 
PRO.19.23	and he who has it rests satisfied;
PRO.19.23	he will not be visited by harm.
PRO.19.24	The sluggard buries his hand in the dish,
PRO.19.24	and will not even bring it back to his mouth.
PRO.19.25	Strike a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence;
PRO.19.25	reprove a man of understanding, and he will gain knowledge.
PRO.19.26	He who does violence to his father and chases away his mother
PRO.19.26	is a son who causes shame and brings reproach.
PRO.19.27	Cease, my son, to hear instruction
PRO.19.27	only to stray from the words of knowledge.
PRO.19.28	A worthless witness mocks at justice,
PRO.19.28	and the mouth of the wicked devours iniquity.
PRO.19.29	Condemnation is ready for scoffers,
PRO.19.29	and flogging for the backs of fools.
PRO.20.1	Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler;
PRO.20.1	and whoever is led astray by it is not wise.
PRO.20.2	The dread wrath of a king is like the growling of a lion;
PRO.20.2	he who provokes him to anger forfeits his life.
PRO.20.3	It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife;
PRO.20.3	but every fool will be quarreling.
PRO.20.4	The sluggard does not plow in the autumn;
PRO.20.4	he will seek at harvest and have nothing.
PRO.20.5	The purpose in a man's mind is like deep water,
PRO.20.5	but a man of understanding will draw it out.
PRO.20.6	Many a man proclaims his own loyalty,
PRO.20.6	but a faithful man who can find?
PRO.20.7	A righteous man who walks in his integrity—
PRO.20.7	blessed are his sons after him!
PRO.20.8	A king who sits on the throne of judgment
PRO.20.8	winnows all evil with his eyes.
PRO.20.9	Who can say, “I have made my heart clean;
PRO.20.9	I am pure from my sin”?
PRO.20.10	Diverse weights and diverse measures
PRO.20.10	are both alike an abomination to the 
PRO.20.11	Even a child makes himself known by his acts,
PRO.20.11	whether what he does is pure and right.
PRO.20.12	The hearing ear and the seeing eye,
PRO.20.12	the 
PRO.20.13	Love not sleep, lest you come to poverty;
PRO.20.13	open your eyes, and you will have plenty of bread.
PRO.20.14	“It is bad, it is bad,” says the buyer;
PRO.20.14	but when he goes away, then he boasts.
PRO.20.15	There is gold, and abundance of costly stones;
PRO.20.15	but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.
PRO.20.16	Take a man's garment when he has given surety for a stranger,
PRO.20.16	and hold him in pledge when he gives surety for foreigners.
PRO.20.17	Bread gained by deceit is sweet to a man,
PRO.20.17	but afterward his mouth will be full of gravel.
PRO.20.18	Plans are established by counsel;
PRO.20.18	by wise guidance wage war.
PRO.20.19	He who goes about gossiping reveals secrets;
PRO.20.19	therefore do not associate with one who speaks foolishly.
PRO.20.20	If one curses his father or his mother,
PRO.20.20	his lamp will be put out in utter darkness.
PRO.20.21	An inheritance gotten hastily in the beginning
PRO.20.21	will in the end not be blessed.
PRO.20.22	Do not say, “I will repay evil”;
PRO.20.22	wait for the 
PRO.20.23	Diverse weights are an abomination to the 
PRO.20.23	and false scales are not good.
PRO.20.24	A man's steps are ordered by the 
PRO.20.24	how then can man understand his way?
PRO.20.25	It is a snare for a man to say rashly, “It is holy,”
PRO.20.25	and to reflect only after making his vows.
PRO.20.26	A wise king winnows the wicked,
PRO.20.26	and drives the wheel over them.
PRO.20.27	The spirit of man is the lamp of the 
PRO.20.27	searching all his innermost parts.
PRO.20.28	Loyalty and faithfulness preserve the king,
PRO.20.28	and his throne is upheld by righteousness.
PRO.20.29	The glory of young men is their strength,
PRO.20.29	but the beauty of old men is their gray hair.
PRO.20.30	Blows that wound cleanse away evil;
PRO.20.30	strokes make clean the innermost parts.
PRO.21.1	The king's heart is a stream of water in the hand of the 
PRO.21.1	he turns it wherever he will.
PRO.21.2	Every way of a man is right in his own eyes,
PRO.21.2	but the 
PRO.21.3	To do righteousness and justice
PRO.21.3	is more acceptable to the 
PRO.21.4	Haughty eyes and a proud heart,
PRO.21.4	the lamp of the wicked, are sin.
PRO.21.5	The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance,
PRO.21.5	but every one who is hasty comes only to want.
PRO.21.6	The getting of treasures by a lying tongue
PRO.21.6	is a fleeting vapor and a snare of death.
PRO.21.7	The violence of the wicked will sweep them away,
PRO.21.7	because they refuse to do what is just.
PRO.21.8	The way of the guilty is crooked,
PRO.21.8	but the conduct of the pure is right.
PRO.21.9	It is better to live in a corner of the housetop
PRO.21.9	than in a house shared with a contentious woman.
PRO.21.10	The soul of the wicked desires evil;
PRO.21.10	his neighbor finds no mercy in his eyes.
PRO.21.11	When a scoffer is punished, the simple becomes wise;
PRO.21.11	when a wise man is instructed, he gains knowledge.
PRO.21.12	The righteous observes the house of the wicked;
PRO.21.12	the wicked are cast down to ruin.
PRO.21.13	He who closes his ear to the cry of the poor
PRO.21.13	will himself cry out and not be heard.
PRO.21.14	A gift in secret averts anger;
PRO.21.14	and a bribe in the bosom, strong wrath.
PRO.21.15	When justice is done, it is a joy to the righteous,
PRO.21.15	but dismay to evildoers.
PRO.21.16	A man who wanders from the way of understanding
PRO.21.16	will rest in the assembly of the dead.
PRO.21.17	He who loves pleasure will be a poor man;
PRO.21.17	he who loves wine and oil will not be rich.
PRO.21.18	The wicked is a ransom for the righteous,
PRO.21.18	and the faithless for the upright.
PRO.21.19	It is better to live in a desert land
PRO.21.19	than with a contentious and fretful woman.
PRO.21.20	Precious treasure remains
PRO.21.20	but a foolish man devours it.
PRO.21.21	He who pursues righteousness and kindness
PRO.21.21	will find life
PRO.21.22	A wise man scales the city of the mighty
PRO.21.22	and brings down the stronghold in which they trust.
PRO.21.23	He who keeps his mouth and his tongue
PRO.21.23	keeps himself out of trouble.
PRO.21.24	“Scoffer” is the name of the proud, haughty man
PRO.21.24	who acts with arrogant pride.
PRO.21.25	The desire of the sluggard kills him
PRO.21.25	for his hands refuse to labor.
PRO.21.26	All day long the wicked covets,
PRO.21.26	but the righteous gives and does not hold back.
PRO.21.27	The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination;
PRO.21.27	how much more when he brings it with evil intent.
PRO.21.28	A false witness will perish,
PRO.21.28	but the word of a man who hears will endure.
PRO.21.29	A wicked man puts on a bold face,
PRO.21.29	but an upright man considers
PRO.21.30	No wisdom, no understanding, no counsel,
PRO.21.30	can avail against the 
PRO.21.31	The horse is made ready for the day of battle,
PRO.21.31	but the victory belongs to the 
PRO.22.1	A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches,
PRO.22.1	and favor is better than silver or gold.
PRO.22.2	The rich and the poor meet together;
PRO.22.2	the 
PRO.22.3	A prudent man sees danger and hides himself;
PRO.22.3	but the simple go on, and suffer for it.
PRO.22.4	The reward for humility and fear of the 
PRO.22.4	is riches and honor and life.
PRO.22.5	Thorns and snares are in the way of the perverse;
PRO.22.5	he who guards himself will keep far from them.
PRO.22.6	Train up a child in the way he should go,
PRO.22.6	and when he is old he will not depart from it.
PRO.22.7	The rich rules over the poor,
PRO.22.7	and the borrower is the slave of the lender.
PRO.22.8	and the rod of his fury will fail.
PRO.22.9	He who has a bountiful eye will be blessed,
PRO.22.9	for he shares his bread with the poor.
PRO.22.10	Drive out a scoffer, and strife will go out,
PRO.22.10	and quarreling and abuse will cease.
PRO.22.11	He who loves purity of heart,
PRO.22.11	and whose speech is gracious, will have the king as his friend.
PRO.22.12	The eyes of the 
PRO.22.12	but he overthrows the words of the faithless.
PRO.22.13	The sluggard says, “There is a lion outside!
PRO.22.13	I shall be slain in the streets!”
PRO.22.14	The mouth of a loose woman is a deep pit;
PRO.22.14	he with whom the 
PRO.22.15	Folly is bound up in the heart of a child,
PRO.22.15	but the rod of discipline drives it far from him.
PRO.22.16	He who oppresses the poor to increase his own wealth,
PRO.22.16	or gives to the rich, will only come to want.
PRO.22.17	Incline your ear, and hear the words of the wise,
PRO.22.17	and apply your mind to my knowledge;
PRO.22.18	for it will be pleasant if you keep them within you,
PRO.22.18	if all of them are ready on your lips.
PRO.22.19	That your trust may be in the 
PRO.22.19	I have made them known to you today, even to you.
PRO.22.20	Have I not written for you thirty sayings
PRO.22.20	of admonition and knowledge,
PRO.22.21	to show you what is right and true,
PRO.22.21	that you may give a true answer to those who sent you?
PRO.22.22	Do not rob the poor, because he is poor,
PRO.22.22	or crush the afflicted at the gate;
PRO.22.23	for the 
PRO.22.23	and despoil of life those who despoil them.
PRO.22.24	Make no friendship with a man given to anger,
PRO.22.24	nor go with a wrathful man,
PRO.22.25	lest you learn his ways
PRO.22.25	and entangle yourself in a snare.
PRO.22.26	Be not one of those who give pledges,
PRO.22.26	who become surety for debts.
PRO.22.27	If you have nothing with which to pay,
PRO.22.27	why should your bed be taken from under you?
PRO.22.28	Remove not the ancient landmark
PRO.22.28	which your fathers have set.
PRO.22.29	Do you see a man skilful in his work?
PRO.22.29	he will stand before kings;
PRO.22.29	he will not stand before obscure men.
PRO.23.1	When you sit down to eat with a ruler,
PRO.23.1	observe carefully what
PRO.23.2	and put a knife to your throat
PRO.23.2	if you are a man given to appetite.
PRO.23.3	Do not desire his delicacies,
PRO.23.3	for they are deceptive food.
PRO.23.4	Do not toil to acquire wealth;
PRO.23.4	be wise enough to desist.
PRO.23.5	When your eyes light upon it, it is gone;
PRO.23.5	for suddenly it takes to itself wings,
PRO.23.5	flying like an eagle toward heaven.
PRO.23.6	Do not eat the bread of a man who is stingy;
PRO.23.6	do not desire his delicacies;
PRO.23.7	for he is like one who is inwardly reckoning.
PRO.23.7	“Eat and drink!” he says to you;
PRO.23.7	but his heart is not with you.
PRO.23.8	You will vomit up the morsels which you have eaten,
PRO.23.8	and waste your pleasant words.
PRO.23.9	Do not speak in the hearing of a fool,
PRO.23.9	for he will despise the wisdom of your words.
PRO.23.10	Do not remove an ancient landmark
PRO.23.10	or enter the fields of the fatherless;
PRO.23.11	for their Redeemer is strong;
PRO.23.11	he will plead their cause against you.
PRO.23.12	Apply your mind to instruction
PRO.23.12	and your ear to words of knowledge.
PRO.23.13	Do not withhold discipline from a child;
PRO.23.13	if you beat him with a rod, he will not die.
PRO.23.14	If you beat him with the rod
PRO.23.14	you will save his life from Sheol.
PRO.23.15	My son, if your heart is wise,
PRO.23.15	my heart too will be glad.
PRO.23.16	My soul will rejoice
PRO.23.16	when your lips speak what is right.
PRO.23.17	Let not your heart envy sinners,
PRO.23.17	but continue in the fear of the 
PRO.23.18	Surely there is a future,
PRO.23.18	and your hope will not be cut off.
PRO.23.19	Hear, my son, and be wise,
PRO.23.19	and direct your mind in the way.
PRO.23.20	Be not among winebibbers,
PRO.23.20	or among gluttonous eaters of meat;
PRO.23.21	for the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty,
PRO.23.21	and drowsiness will clothe a man with rags.
PRO.23.22	Hearken to your father who begot you,
PRO.23.22	and do not despise your mother when she is old.
PRO.23.23	Buy truth, and do not sell it;
PRO.23.23	buy wisdom, instruction, and understanding.
PRO.23.24	The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice;
PRO.23.24	he who begets a wise son will be glad in him.
PRO.23.25	Let your father and mother be glad,
PRO.23.25	let her who bore you rejoice.
PRO.23.26	My son, give me your heart,
PRO.23.26	and let your eyes observe
PRO.23.27	For a harlot is a deep pit;
PRO.23.27	an adventuress is a narrow well.
PRO.23.28	She lies in wait like a robber
PRO.23.28	and increases the faithless among men.
PRO.23.29	Who has woe? Who has sorrow?
PRO.23.29	Who has strife? Who has complaining?
PRO.23.29	Who has wounds without cause?
PRO.23.29	Who has redness of eyes?
PRO.23.30	Those who tarry long over wine,
PRO.23.30	those who go to try mixed wine.
PRO.23.31	Do not look at wine when it is red,
PRO.23.31	when it sparkles in the cup
PRO.23.31	and goes down smoothly.
PRO.23.32	At the last it bites like a serpent,
PRO.23.32	and stings like an adder.
PRO.23.33	Your eyes will see strange things,
PRO.23.33	and your mind utter perverse things.
PRO.23.34	You will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea,
PRO.23.34	like one who lies on the top of a mast.
PRO.23.35	“They struck me,” you will say,
PRO.23.35	they beat me, but I did not feel it.
PRO.23.35	When shall I awake?
PRO.23.35	I will seek another drink.”
PRO.24.1	Be not envious of evil men,
PRO.24.1	nor desire to be with them;
PRO.24.2	for their minds devise violence,
PRO.24.2	and their lips talk of mischief.
PRO.24.3	By wisdom a house is built,
PRO.24.3	and by understanding it is established;
PRO.24.4	by knowledge the rooms are filled
PRO.24.4	with all precious and pleasant riches.
PRO.24.5	A wise man is mightier than a strong man,
PRO.24.5	and a man of knowledge than he who has strength;
PRO.24.6	for by wise guidance you can wage your war,
PRO.24.6	and in abundance of counselors there is victory.
PRO.24.7	Wisdom is too high for a fool;
PRO.24.7	in the gate he does not open his mouth.
PRO.24.8	He who plans to do evil
PRO.24.8	will be called a mischief-maker.
PRO.24.9	The devising of folly is sin,
PRO.24.9	and the scoffer is an abomination to men.
PRO.24.10	If you faint in the day of adversity,
PRO.24.10	your strength is small.
PRO.24.11	Rescue those who are being taken away to death;
PRO.24.11	hold back those who are stumbling to the slaughter.
PRO.24.12	If you say, “Behold, we did not know this,”
PRO.24.12	does not he who weighs the heart perceive it?
PRO.24.12	Does not he who keeps watch over your soul know it,
PRO.24.12	and will he not requite man according to his work?
PRO.24.13	My son, eat honey, for it is good,
PRO.24.13	and the drippings of the honeycomb are sweet to your taste.
PRO.24.14	Know that wisdom is such to your soul;
PRO.24.14	if you find it, there will be a future,
PRO.24.14	and your hope will not be cut off.
PRO.24.15	Lie not in wait as a wicked man against the dwelling of the righteous;
PRO.24.15	do not violence to his home;
PRO.24.16	for a righteous man falls seven times, and rises again;
PRO.24.16	but the wicked are overthrown by calamity.
PRO.24.17	Do not rejoice when your enemy falls,
PRO.24.17	and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles;
PRO.24.18	lest the 
PRO.24.18	and turn away his anger from him.
PRO.24.19	Fret not yourself because of evildoers,
PRO.24.19	and be not envious of the wicked;
PRO.24.20	for the evil man has no future;
PRO.24.20	the lamp of the wicked will be put out.
PRO.24.21	My son, fear the 
PRO.24.21	and do not disobey either of them;
PRO.24.22	for disaster from them will rise suddenly,
PRO.24.22	and who knows the ruin that will come from them both?
PRO.24.23	These also are sayings of the wise.
PRO.24.23	Partiality in judging is not good.
PRO.24.24	He who says to the wicked, “You are innocent,”
PRO.24.24	will be cursed by peoples, abhorred by nations;
PRO.24.25	but those who rebuke the wicked will have delight,
PRO.24.25	and a good blessing will be upon them.
PRO.24.26	He who gives a right answer
PRO.24.26	kisses the lips.
PRO.24.27	Prepare your work outside,
PRO.24.27	get everything ready for you in the field;
PRO.24.27	and after that build your house.
PRO.24.28	Be not a witness against your neighbor without cause,
PRO.24.28	and do not deceive with your lips.
PRO.24.29	Do not say, “I will do to him as he has done to me;
PRO.24.29	I will pay the man back for what he has done.”
PRO.24.30	I passed by the field of a sluggard,
PRO.24.30	by the vineyard of a man without sense;
PRO.24.31	and lo, it was all overgrown with thorns;
PRO.24.31	the ground was covered with nettles,
PRO.24.31	and its stone wall was broken down.
PRO.24.32	Then I saw and considered it;
PRO.24.32	I looked and received instruction.
PRO.24.33	A little sleep, a little slumber,
PRO.24.33	a little folding of the hands to rest,
PRO.24.34	and poverty will come upon you like a robber,
PRO.24.34	and want like an armed man.
PRO.25.1	These also are proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied.
PRO.25.2	It is the glory of God to conceal things,
PRO.25.2	but the glory of kings is to search things out.
PRO.25.3	As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth,
PRO.25.3	so the mind of kings is unsearchable.
PRO.25.4	Take away the dross from the silver,
PRO.25.4	and the smith has material for a vessel;
PRO.25.5	take away the wicked from the presence of the king,
PRO.25.5	and his throne will be established in righteousness.
PRO.25.6	Do not put yourself forward in the king's presence
PRO.25.6	or stand in the place of the great;
PRO.25.7	for it is better to be told, “Come up here,”
PRO.25.7	than to be put lower in the presence of the prince.
PRO.25.7	What your eyes have seen
PRO.25.8	do not hastily bring into court;
PRO.25.8	for
PRO.25.8	when your neighbor puts you to shame?
PRO.25.9	Argue your case with your neighbor himself,
PRO.25.9	and do not disclose another's secret;
PRO.25.10	lest he who hears you bring shame upon you,
PRO.25.10	and your ill repute have no end.
PRO.25.11	A word fitly spoken
PRO.25.11	is like apples of gold in a setting of silver.
PRO.25.12	Like a gold ring or an ornament of gold
PRO.25.12	is a wise reprover to a listening ear.
PRO.25.13	Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest
PRO.25.13	is a faithful messenger to those who send him,
PRO.25.13	he refreshes the spirit of his masters.
PRO.25.14	Like clouds and wind without rain
PRO.25.14	is a man who boasts of a gift he does not give.
PRO.25.15	With patience a ruler may be persuaded,
PRO.25.15	and a soft tongue will break a bone.
PRO.25.16	If you have found honey, eat only enough for you,
PRO.25.16	lest you be sated with it and vomit it.
PRO.25.17	Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor's house,
PRO.25.17	lest he become weary of you and hate you.
PRO.25.18	A man who bears false witness against his neighbor
PRO.25.18	is like a war club, or a sword, or a sharp arrow.
PRO.25.19	Trust in a faithless man in time of trouble
PRO.25.19	is like a bad tooth or a foot that slips.
PRO.25.20	He who sings songs to a heavy heart
PRO.25.20	is like one who takes off a garment on a cold day,
PRO.25.20	and like vinegar on a wound.
PRO.25.21	and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink;
PRO.25.22	for you will heap coals of fire on his head,
PRO.25.22	and the 
PRO.25.23	The north wind brings forth rain;
PRO.25.23	and a backbiting tongue, angry looks.
PRO.25.24	It is better to live in a corner of the housetop
PRO.25.24	than in a house shared with a contentious woman.
PRO.25.25	Like cold water to a thirsty soul,
PRO.25.25	so is good news from a far country.
PRO.25.26	Like a muddied spring or a polluted fountain
PRO.25.26	is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked.
PRO.25.27	It is not good to eat much honey,
PRO.25.27	so be sparing of complimentary words.
PRO.25.28	A man without self-control
PRO.25.28	is like a city broken into and left without walls.
PRO.26.1	Like snow in summer or rain in harvest,
PRO.26.1	so honor is not fitting for a fool.
PRO.26.2	Like a sparrow in its flitting, like a swallow in its flying,
PRO.26.2	a curse that is causeless does not alight.
PRO.26.3	A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass,
PRO.26.3	and a rod for the back of fools.
PRO.26.4	Answer not a fool according to his folly,
PRO.26.4	lest you be like him yourself.
PRO.26.5	Answer a fool according to his folly,
PRO.26.5	lest he be wise in his own eyes.
PRO.26.6	He who sends a message by the hand of a fool
PRO.26.6	cuts off his own feet and drinks violence.
PRO.26.7	Like a lame man's legs, which hang useless,
PRO.26.7	is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
PRO.26.8	Like one who binds the stone in the sling
PRO.26.8	is he who gives honor to a fool.
PRO.26.9	Like a thorn that goes up into the hand of a drunkard
PRO.26.9	is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
PRO.26.10	Like an archer who wounds everybody
PRO.26.10	is he who hires a passing fool or drunkard.
PRO.26.11	is a fool that repeats his folly.
PRO.26.12	Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes?
PRO.26.12	There is more hope for a fool than for him.
PRO.26.13	The sluggard says, “There is a lion in the road!
PRO.26.13	There is a lion in the streets!”
PRO.26.14	As a door turns on its hinges,
PRO.26.14	so does a sluggard on his bed.
PRO.26.15	The sluggard buries his hand in the dish;
PRO.26.15	it wears him out to bring it back to his mouth.
PRO.26.16	The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes
PRO.26.16	than seven men who can answer discreetly.
PRO.26.17	He who meddles in a quarrel not his own
PRO.26.17	is like one who takes a passing dog by the ears.
PRO.26.18	Like a madman who throws firebrands,
PRO.26.18	arrows, and death,
PRO.26.19	is the man who deceives his neighbor
PRO.26.19	and says, “I am only joking!”
PRO.26.20	For lack of wood the fire goes out;
PRO.26.20	and where there is no whisperer, quarreling ceases.
PRO.26.21	As charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire,
PRO.26.21	so is a quarrelsome man for kindling strife.
PRO.26.22	The words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels;
PRO.26.22	they go down into the inner parts of the body.
PRO.26.23	Like the glaze
PRO.26.23	are smooth
PRO.26.24	He who hates, dissembles with his lips
PRO.26.24	and harbors deceit in his heart;
PRO.26.25	when he speaks graciously, believe him not,
PRO.26.25	for there are seven abominations in his heart;
PRO.26.26	though his hatred be covered with guile,
PRO.26.26	his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.
PRO.26.27	He who digs a pit will fall into it,
PRO.26.27	and a stone will come back upon him who starts it rolling.
PRO.26.28	A lying tongue hates its victims,
PRO.26.28	and a flattering mouth works ruin.
PRO.27.1	Do not boast about tomorrow,
PRO.27.1	for you do not know what a day may bring forth.
PRO.27.2	Let another praise you, and not your own mouth;
PRO.27.2	a stranger, and not your own lips.
PRO.27.3	A stone is heavy, and sand is weighty,
PRO.27.3	but a fool's provocation is heavier than both.
PRO.27.4	Wrath is cruel, anger is overwhelming;
PRO.27.4	but who can stand before jealousy?
PRO.27.5	Better is open rebuke
PRO.27.5	than hidden love.
PRO.27.6	Faithful are the wounds of a friend;
PRO.27.6	profuse are the kisses of an enemy.
PRO.27.7	He who is sated loathes honey,
PRO.27.7	but to one who is hungry everything bitter is sweet.
PRO.27.8	Like a bird that strays from its nest,
PRO.27.8	is a man who strays from his home.
PRO.27.9	Oil and perfume make the heart glad,
PRO.27.9	but the soul is torn by trouble.
PRO.27.10	Your friend, and your father's friend, do not forsake;
PRO.27.10	and do not go to your brother's house in the day of your calamity.
PRO.27.10	Better is a neighbor who is near
PRO.27.10	than a brother who is far away.
PRO.27.11	Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad,
PRO.27.11	that I may answer him who reproaches me.
PRO.27.12	A prudent man sees danger and hides himself;
PRO.27.12	but the simple go on, and suffer for it.
PRO.27.13	Take a man's garment when he has given surety for a stranger,
PRO.27.13	and hold him in pledge when he gives surety for foreigners.
PRO.27.14	He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice,
PRO.27.14	rising early in the morning,
PRO.27.14	will be counted as cursing.
PRO.27.15	A continual dripping on a rainy day
PRO.27.15	and a contentious woman are alike;
PRO.27.16	to restrain her is to restrain the wind
PRO.27.16	or to grasp oil in one's right hand.
PRO.27.17	Iron sharpens iron,
PRO.27.17	and one man sharpens another.
PRO.27.18	He who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit,
PRO.27.18	and he who guards his master will be honored.
PRO.27.19	As in water face answers to face,
PRO.27.19	so the mind of man reflects the man.
PRO.27.20	Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied,
PRO.27.20	and never satisfied are the eyes of man.
PRO.27.21	The crucible is for silver, and the furnace is for gold,
PRO.27.21	and a man is judged by his praise.
PRO.27.22	Crush a fool in a mortar with a pestle
PRO.27.22	along with crushed grain,
PRO.27.22	yet his folly will not depart from him.
PRO.27.23	Know well the condition of your flocks,
PRO.27.23	and give attention to your herds;
PRO.27.24	for riches do not last for ever;
PRO.27.24	and does a crown endure to all generations?
PRO.27.25	When the grass is gone, and the new growth appears,
PRO.27.25	and the herbage of the mountains is gathered,
PRO.27.26	the lambs will provide your clothing,
PRO.27.26	and the goats the price of a field;
PRO.27.27	there will be enough goats' milk for your food,
PRO.27.27	for the food of your household
PRO.27.27	and maintenance for your maidens.
PRO.28.1	The wicked flee when no one pursues,
PRO.28.1	but the righteous are bold as a lion.
PRO.28.2	When a land transgresses it has many rulers;
PRO.28.2	but with men of understanding and knowledge
PRO.28.2	its stability will long continue.
PRO.28.3	A poor man who oppresses the poor
PRO.28.3	is a beating rain that leaves no food.
PRO.28.4	Those who forsake the law praise the wicked,
PRO.28.4	but those who keep the law strive against them.
PRO.28.5	Evil men do not understand justice,
PRO.28.5	but those who seek the 
PRO.28.6	Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity
PRO.28.6	than a rich man who is perverse in his ways.
PRO.28.7	He who keeps the law is a wise son,
PRO.28.7	but a companion of gluttons shames his father.
PRO.28.8	He who augments his wealth by interest and increase
PRO.28.8	gathers it for him who is kind to the poor.
PRO.28.9	If one turns away his ear from hearing the law,
PRO.28.9	even his prayer is an abomination.
PRO.28.10	He who misleads the upright into an evil way
PRO.28.10	will fall into his own pit;
PRO.28.10	but the blameless will have a goodly inheritance.
PRO.28.11	A rich man is wise in his own eyes,
PRO.28.11	but a poor man who has understanding will find him out.
PRO.28.12	When the righteous triumph, there is great glory;
PRO.28.12	but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.
PRO.28.13	He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper,
PRO.28.13	but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.
PRO.28.14	Blessed is the man who fears the 
PRO.28.14	but he who hardens his heart will fall into calamity.
PRO.28.15	Like a roaring lion or a charging bear
PRO.28.15	is a wicked ruler over a poor people.
PRO.28.16	A ruler who lacks understanding is a cruel oppressor;
PRO.28.16	but he who hates unjust gain will prolong his days.
PRO.28.17	If a man is burdened with the blood of another,
PRO.28.17	let him be a fugitive until death;
PRO.28.17	let no one help him.
PRO.28.18	He who walks in integrity will be delivered,
PRO.28.18	but he who is perverse in his ways will fall into a pit.
PRO.28.19	He who tills his land will have plenty of bread,
PRO.28.19	but he who follows worthless pursuits will have plenty of poverty.
PRO.28.20	A faithful man will abound with blessings,
PRO.28.20	but he who hastens to be rich will not go unpunished.
PRO.28.21	To show partiality is not good;
PRO.28.21	but for a piece of bread a man will do wrong.
PRO.28.22	A miserly man hastens after wealth,
PRO.28.22	and does not know that want will come upon him.
PRO.28.23	He who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor
PRO.28.23	than he who flatters with his tongue.
PRO.28.24	He who robs his father or his mother
PRO.28.24	and says, “That is no transgression,”
PRO.28.24	is the companion of a man who destroys.
PRO.28.25	A greedy man stirs up strife,
PRO.28.25	but he who trusts in the 
PRO.28.26	He who trusts in his own mind is a fool;
PRO.28.26	but he who walks in wisdom will be delivered.
PRO.28.27	He who gives to the poor will not want,
PRO.28.27	but he who hides his eyes will get many a curse.
PRO.28.28	When the wicked rise, men hide themselves,
PRO.28.28	but when they perish, the righteous increase.
PRO.29.1	He who is often reproved, yet stiffens his neck,
PRO.29.1	will suddenly be broken beyond healing.
PRO.29.2	When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice;
PRO.29.2	but when the wicked rule, the people groan.
PRO.29.3	He who loves wisdom makes his father glad,
PRO.29.3	but one who keeps company with harlots squanders his substance.
PRO.29.4	By justice a king gives stability to the land,
PRO.29.4	but one who exacts gifts ruins it.
PRO.29.5	A man who flatters his neighbor
PRO.29.5	spreads a net for his feet.
PRO.29.6	An evil man is ensnared in his transgression,
PRO.29.6	but a righteous man sings and rejoices.
PRO.29.7	A righteous man knows the rights of the poor;
PRO.29.7	a wicked man does not understand such knowledge.
PRO.29.8	Scoffers set a city aflame,
PRO.29.8	but wise men turn away wrath.
PRO.29.9	If a wise man has an argument with a fool,
PRO.29.9	the fool only rages and laughs, and there is no quiet.
PRO.29.10	Bloodthirsty men hate one who is blameless,
PRO.29.10	and the wicked
PRO.29.11	A fool gives full vent to his anger,
PRO.29.11	but a wise man quietly holds it back.
PRO.29.12	If a ruler listens to falsehood,
PRO.29.12	all his officials will be wicked.
PRO.29.13	The poor man and the oppressor meet together;
PRO.29.13	the 
PRO.29.14	If a king judges the poor with equity
PRO.29.14	his throne will be established for ever.
PRO.29.15	The rod and reproof give wisdom,
PRO.29.15	but a child left to himself brings shame to his mother.
PRO.29.16	When the wicked are in authority, transgression increases;
PRO.29.16	but the righteous will look upon their downfall.
PRO.29.17	Discipline your son, and he will give you rest;
PRO.29.17	he will give delight to your heart.
PRO.29.18	Where there is no prophecy the people cast off restraint,
PRO.29.18	but blessed is he who keeps the law.
PRO.29.19	By mere words a servant is not disciplined,
PRO.29.19	for though he understands, he will not give heed.
PRO.29.20	Do you see a man who is hasty in his words?
PRO.29.20	There is more hope for a fool than for him.
PRO.29.21	He who pampers his servant from childhood,
PRO.29.21	will in the end find him his heir.
PRO.29.22	A man of wrath stirs up strife,
PRO.29.22	and a man given to anger causes much transgression.
PRO.29.23	A man's pride will bring him low,
PRO.29.23	but he who is lowly in spirit will obtain honor.
PRO.29.24	The partner of a thief hates his own life;
PRO.29.24	he hears the curse, but discloses nothing.
PRO.29.25	The fear of man lays a snare,
PRO.29.25	but he who trusts in the 
PRO.29.26	Many seek the favor of a ruler,
PRO.29.26	but from the 
PRO.29.27	An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous,
PRO.29.27	but he whose way is straight is an abomination to the wicked.
PRO.30.1	The words of Agur son of Jakeh of Massa.
PRO.30.1	The man says to Ithi-el,
PRO.30.1	to Ithi-el and Ucal:
PRO.30.2	Surely I am too stupid to be a man.
PRO.30.2	I have not the understanding of a man.
PRO.30.3	I have not learned wisdom,
PRO.30.3	nor have I knowledge of the Holy One.
PRO.30.4	Who has ascended to heaven and come down?
PRO.30.4	Who has gathered the wind in his fists?
PRO.30.4	Who has wrapped up the waters in a garment?
PRO.30.4	Who has established all the ends of the earth?
PRO.30.4	What is his name, and what is his son's name?
PRO.30.4	Surely you know!
PRO.30.5	Every word of God proves true;
PRO.30.5	he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
PRO.30.6	Do not add to his words,
PRO.30.6	lest he rebuke you, and you be found a liar.
PRO.30.7	Two things I ask of thee;
PRO.30.7	deny them not to me before I die:
PRO.30.8	Remove far from me falsehood and lying;
PRO.30.8	give me neither poverty nor riches;
PRO.30.8	feed me with the food that is needful for me,
PRO.30.9	lest I be full, and deny thee,
PRO.30.9	and say, “Who is the 
PRO.30.9	or lest I be poor, and steal,
PRO.30.9	and profane the name of my God.
PRO.30.10	Do not slander a servant to his master,
PRO.30.10	lest he curse you, and you be held guilty.
PRO.30.11	There are those who curse their fathers
PRO.30.11	and do not bless their mothers.
PRO.30.12	There are those who are pure in their own eyes
PRO.30.12	but are not cleansed of their filth.
PRO.30.13	There are those—how lofty are their eyes,
PRO.30.13	how high their eyelids lift!
PRO.30.14	There are those whose teeth are swords,
PRO.30.14	whose teeth are knives,
PRO.30.14	to devour the poor from off the earth,
PRO.30.14	the needy from among men.
PRO.30.15	The leech
PRO.30.15	“Give, give,” they cry.
PRO.30.15	Three things are never satisfied;
PRO.30.15	four never say, “Enough”:
PRO.30.16	Sheol, the barren womb,
PRO.30.16	the earth ever thirsty for water,
PRO.30.16	and the fire which never says, “Enough.”
PRO.30.17	The eye that mocks a father
PRO.30.17	and scorns to obey a mother
PRO.30.17	will be picked out by the ravens of the valley
PRO.30.17	and eaten by the vultures.
PRO.30.18	Three things are too wonderful for me;
PRO.30.18	four I do not understand:
PRO.30.19	the way of an eagle in the sky,
PRO.30.19	the way of a serpent on a rock,
PRO.30.19	the way of a ship on the high seas,
PRO.30.19	and the way of a man with a maiden.
PRO.30.20	This is the way of an adulteress:
PRO.30.20	she eats, and wipes her mouth,
PRO.30.20	and says, “I have done no wrong.”
PRO.30.21	Under three things the earth trembles;
PRO.30.21	under four it cannot bear up:
PRO.30.22	a slave when he becomes king,
PRO.30.22	and a fool when he is filled with food;
PRO.30.23	an unloved woman when she gets a husband,
PRO.30.23	and a maid when she succeeds her mistress.
PRO.30.24	Four things on earth are small,
PRO.30.24	but they are exceedingly wise:
PRO.30.25	the ants are a people not strong,
PRO.30.25	yet they provide their food in the summer;
PRO.30.26	the badgers are a people not mighty,
PRO.30.26	yet they make their homes in the rocks;
PRO.30.27	the locusts have no king,
PRO.30.27	yet all of them march in rank;
PRO.30.28	the lizard you can take in your hands,
PRO.30.28	yet it is in kings' palaces.
PRO.30.29	Three things are stately in their tread;
PRO.30.29	four are stately in their stride:
PRO.30.30	the lion, which is mightiest among beasts
PRO.30.30	and does not turn back before any;
PRO.30.31	the strutting cock,
PRO.30.31	and a king striding before
PRO.30.32	If you have been foolish, exalting yourself,
PRO.30.32	or if you have been devising evil,
PRO.30.32	put your hand on your mouth.
PRO.30.33	For pressing milk produces curds,
PRO.30.33	pressing the nose produces blood,
PRO.30.33	and pressing anger produces strife.
PRO.31.1	The words of Lemuel, king of Massa,
PRO.31.2	What, my son? What, son of my womb?
PRO.31.2	What, son of my vows?
PRO.31.3	Give not your strength to women,
PRO.31.3	your ways to those who destroy kings.
PRO.31.4	It is not for kings, O Lemuel,
PRO.31.4	it is not for kings to drink wine,
PRO.31.4	or for rulers to desire
PRO.31.5	lest they drink and forget what has been decreed,
PRO.31.5	and pervert the rights of all the afflicted.
PRO.31.6	Give strong drink to him who is perishing,
PRO.31.6	and wine to those in bitter distress;
PRO.31.7	let them drink and forget their poverty,
PRO.31.7	and remember their misery no more.
PRO.31.8	Open your mouth for the dumb,
PRO.31.8	for the rights of all who are left desolate.
PRO.31.9	Open your mouth, judge righteously,
PRO.31.9	maintain the rights of the poor and needy.
PRO.31.10	A good wife who can find?
PRO.31.10	She is far more precious than jewels.
PRO.31.11	The heart of her husband trusts in her,
PRO.31.11	and he will have no lack of gain.
PRO.31.12	She does him good, and not harm,
PRO.31.12	all the days of her life.
PRO.31.13	She seeks wool and flax,
PRO.31.13	and works with willing hands.
PRO.31.14	She is like the ships of the merchant,
PRO.31.14	she brings her food from afar.
PRO.31.15	She rises while it is yet night
PRO.31.15	and provides food for her household
PRO.31.15	and tasks for her maidens.
PRO.31.16	She considers a field and buys it;
PRO.31.16	with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.
PRO.31.17	She girds her loins with strength
PRO.31.17	and makes her arms strong.
PRO.31.18	She perceives that her merchandise is profitable.
PRO.31.18	Her lamp does not go out at night.
PRO.31.19	She puts her hands to the distaff,
PRO.31.19	and her hands hold the spindle.
PRO.31.20	She opens her hand to the poor,
PRO.31.20	and reaches out her hands to the needy.
PRO.31.21	She is not afraid of snow for her household,
PRO.31.21	for all her household are clothed in scarlet.
PRO.31.22	She makes herself coverings;
PRO.31.22	her clothing is fine linen and purple.
PRO.31.23	Her husband is known in the gates,
PRO.31.23	when he sits among the elders of the land.
PRO.31.24	She makes linen garments and sells them;
PRO.31.24	she delivers girdles to the merchant.
PRO.31.25	Strength and dignity are her clothing,
PRO.31.25	and she laughs at the time to come.
PRO.31.26	She opens her mouth with wisdom,
PRO.31.26	and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.
PRO.31.27	She looks well to the ways of her household,
PRO.31.27	and does not eat the bread of idleness.
PRO.31.28	Her children rise up and call her blessed;
PRO.31.28	her husband also, and he praises her:
PRO.31.29	“Many women have done excellently,
PRO.31.29	but you surpass them all.”
PRO.31.30	Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain,
PRO.31.30	but a woman who fears the 
PRO.31.31	Give her of the fruit of her hands,
PRO.31.31	and let her works praise her in the gates.
ECC.1.1	The words of the Preacher,
ECC.1.2	Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher,
ECC.1.2	vanity of vanities! All is vanity.
ECC.1.3	What does man gain by all the toil
ECC.1.3	at which he toils under the sun?
ECC.1.4	A generation goes, and a generation comes,
ECC.1.4	but the earth remains for ever.
ECC.1.5	The sun rises and the sun goes down,
ECC.1.5	and hastens to the place where it rises.
ECC.1.6	The wind blows to the south,
ECC.1.6	and goes round to the north;
ECC.1.6	round and round goes the wind,
ECC.1.6	and on its circuits the wind returns.
ECC.1.7	All streams run to the sea,
ECC.1.7	but the sea is not full;
ECC.1.7	to the place where the streams flow,
ECC.1.7	there they flow again.
ECC.1.8	All things are full of weariness;
ECC.1.8	a man cannot utter it;
ECC.1.8	the eye is not satisfied with seeing,
ECC.1.8	nor the ear filled with hearing.
ECC.1.9	What has been is what will be,
ECC.1.9	and what has been done is what will be done;
ECC.1.9	and there is nothing new under the sun.
ECC.1.10	Is there a thing of which it is said,
ECC.1.10	“See, this is new”?
ECC.1.10	It has been already,
ECC.1.10	in the ages before us.
ECC.1.11	There is no remembrance of former things,
ECC.1.11	nor will there be any remembrance
ECC.1.11	of later things yet to happen
ECC.1.11	among those who come after.
ECC.1.12	I the Preacher have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. 
ECC.1.13	And I applied my mind to seek and to search out by wisdom all that is done under heaven; it is an unhappy business that God has given to the sons of men to be busy with. 
ECC.1.14	I have seen everything that is done under the sun; and behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.
ECC.1.15	What is crooked cannot be made straight,
ECC.1.15	and what is lacking cannot be numbered.
ECC.1.16	I said to myself, “I have acquired great wisdom, surpassing all who were over Jerusalem before me; and my mind has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.” 
ECC.1.17	And I applied my mind to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is but a striving after wind.
ECC.1.18	For in much wisdom is much vexation,
ECC.1.18	and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.
ECC.2.1	I said to myself, “Come now, I will make a test of pleasure; enjoy yourself.” But behold, this also was vanity. 
ECC.2.2	I said of laughter, “It is mad,” and of pleasure, “What use is it?” 
ECC.2.3	I searched with my mind how to cheer my body with wine—my mind still guiding me with wisdom—and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was good for the sons of men to do under heaven during the few days of their life. 
ECC.2.4	I made great works; I built houses and planted vineyards for myself; 
ECC.2.5	I made myself gardens and parks, and planted in them all kinds of fruit trees. 
ECC.2.6	I made myself pools from which to water the forest of growing trees. 
ECC.2.7	I bought male and female slaves, and had slaves who were born in my house; I had also great possessions of herds and flocks, more than any who had been before me in Jerusalem. 
ECC.2.8	I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces; I got singers, both men and women, and many concubines,
ECC.2.9	So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem; also my wisdom remained with me. 
ECC.2.10	And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them; I kept my heart from no pleasure, for my heart found pleasure in all my toil, and this was my reward for all my toil. 
ECC.2.11	Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had spent in doing it, and behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was nothing to be gained under the sun.
ECC.2.12	So I turned to consider wisdom and madness and folly; for what can the man do who comes after the king? Only what he has already done. 
ECC.2.13	Then I saw that wisdom excels folly as light excels darkness. 
ECC.2.14	The wise man has his eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness; and yet I perceived that one fate comes to all of them. 
ECC.2.15	Then I said to myself, “What befalls the fool will befall me also; why then have I been so very wise?” And I said to myself that this also is vanity. 
ECC.2.16	For of the wise man as of the fool there is no enduring remembrance, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. How the wise man dies just like the fool! 
ECC.2.17	So I hated life, because what is done under the sun was grievous to me; for all is vanity and a striving after wind.
ECC.2.18	I hated all my toil in which I had toiled under the sun, seeing that I must leave it to the man who will come after me; 
ECC.2.19	and who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will be master of all for which I toiled and used my wisdom under the sun. This also is vanity. 
ECC.2.20	So I turned about and gave my heart up to despair over all the toil of my labors under the sun, 
ECC.2.21	because sometimes a man who has toiled with wisdom and knowledge and skill must leave all to be enjoyed by a man who did not toil for it. This also is vanity and a great evil. 
ECC.2.22	What has a man from all the toil and strain with which he toils beneath the sun? 
ECC.2.23	For all his days are full of pain, and his work is a vexation; even in the night his mind does not rest. This also is vanity.
ECC.2.24	There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink and find enjoyment in his toil. This also, I saw, is from the hand of God; 
ECC.2.25	for apart from him
ECC.2.26	For to the man who pleases him God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy; but to the sinner he gives the work of gathering and heaping, only to give to one who pleases God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.
ECC.3.1	For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven:
ECC.3.2	a time to be born, and a time to die;
ECC.3.2	a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted;
ECC.3.3	a time to kill, and a time to heal;
ECC.3.3	a time to break down, and a time to build up;
ECC.3.4	a time to weep, and a time to laugh;
ECC.3.4	a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
ECC.3.5	a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together;
ECC.3.5	a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
ECC.3.6	a time to seek, and a time to lose;
ECC.3.6	a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
ECC.3.7	a time to rend, and a time to sew;
ECC.3.7	a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
ECC.3.8	a time to love, and a time to hate;
ECC.3.8	a time for war, and a time for peace.
ECC.3.9	What gain has the worker from his toil?
ECC.3.10	I have seen the business that God has given to the sons of men to be busy with. 
ECC.3.11	He has made everything beautiful in its time; also he has put eternity into man's mind, yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end. 
ECC.3.12	I know that there is nothing better for them than to be happy and enjoy themselves as long as they live; 
ECC.3.13	also that it is God's gift to man that every one should eat and drink and take pleasure in all his toil. 
ECC.3.14	I know that whatever God does endures for ever; nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it; God has made it so, in order that men should fear before him. 
ECC.3.15	That which is, already has been; that which is to be, already has been; and God seeks what has been driven away.
ECC.3.16	Moreover I saw under the sun that in the place of justice, even there was wickedness, and in the place of righteousness, even there was wickedness. 
ECC.3.17	I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for he has appointed a time for every matter, and for every work. 
ECC.3.18	I said in my heart with regard to the sons of men that God is testing them to show them that they are but beasts. 
ECC.3.19	For the fate of the sons of men and the fate of beasts is the same; as one dies, so dies the other. They all have the same breath, and man has no advantage over the beasts; for all is vanity. 
ECC.3.20	All go to one place; all are from the dust, and all turn to dust again. 
ECC.3.21	Who knows whether the spirit of man goes upward and the spirit of the beast goes down to the earth? 
ECC.3.22	So I saw that there is nothing better than that a man should enjoy his work, for that is his lot; who can bring him to see what will be after him?
ECC.4.1	Again I saw all the oppressions that are practiced under the sun. And behold, the tears of the oppressed, and they had no one to comfort them! On the side of their oppressors there was power, and there was no one to comfort them. 
ECC.4.2	And I thought the dead who are already dead more fortunate than the living who are still alive; 
ECC.4.3	but better than both is he who has not yet been, and has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun.
ECC.4.4	Then I saw that all toil and all skill in work come from a man's envy of his neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.
ECC.4.5	The fool folds his hands, and eats his own flesh.
ECC.4.6	Better is a handful of quietness than two hands full of toil and a striving after wind.
ECC.4.7	Again, I saw vanity under the sun: 
ECC.4.8	a person who has no one, either son or brother, yet there is no end to all his toil, and his eyes are never satisfied with riches, so that he never asks, “For whom am I toiling and depriving myself of pleasure?” This also is vanity and an unhappy business.
ECC.4.9	Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil. 
ECC.4.10	For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up. 
ECC.4.11	Again, if two lie together, they are warm; but how can one be warm alone? 
ECC.4.12	And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him. A threefold cord is not quickly broken.
ECC.4.13	Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king, who will no longer take advice, 
ECC.4.14	even though he had gone from prison to the throne or in his own kingdom had been born poor. 
ECC.4.15	I saw all the living who move about under the sun, as well as that
ECC.4.16	there was no end of all the people; he was over all of them. Yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.
ECC.5.2	 Be not rash with your mouth, nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God, for God is in heaven, and you upon earth; therefore let your words be few.
ECC.5.3	For a dream comes with much business, and a fool's voice with many words.
ECC.5.4	When you vow a vow to God, do not delay paying it; for he has no pleasure in fools. Pay what you vow. 
ECC.5.5	It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay. 
ECC.5.6	Let not your mouth lead you into sin, and do not say before the messenger
ECC.5.7	For when dreams increase, empty words grow many:
ECC.5.8	If you see in a province the poor oppressed and justice and right violently taken away, do not be amazed at the matter; for the high official is watched by a higher, and there are yet higher ones over them. 
ECC.5.9	But in all, a king is an advantage to a land with cultivated fields.
ECC.5.10	He who loves money will not be satisfied with money; nor he who loves wealth, with gain: this also is vanity.
ECC.5.11	When goods increase, they increase who eat them; and what gain has their owner but to see them with his eyes?
ECC.5.12	Sweet is the sleep of a laborer, whether he eats little or much; but the surfeit of the rich will not let him sleep.
ECC.5.13	There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owner to his hurt, 
ECC.5.14	and those riches were lost in a bad venture; and he is father of a son, but he has nothing in his hand. 
ECC.5.15	As he came from his mother's womb he shall go again, naked as he came, and shall take nothing for his toil, which he may carry away in his hand. 
ECC.5.16	This also is a grievous evil: just as he came, so shall he go; and what gain has he that he toiled for the wind, 
ECC.5.17	and spent all his days in darkness and grief,
ECC.5.18	Behold, what I have seen to be good and to be fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of his life which God has given him, for this is his lot. 
ECC.5.19	Every man also to whom God has given wealth and possessions and power to enjoy them, and to accept his lot and find enjoyment in his toil—this is the gift of God. 
ECC.5.20	For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart.
ECC.6.1	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it lies heavy upon men: 
ECC.6.2	a man to whom God gives wealth, possessions, and honor, so that he lacks nothing of all that he desires, yet God does not give him power to enjoy them, but a stranger enjoys them; this is vanity; it is a sore affliction. 
ECC.6.3	If a man begets a hundred children, and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but he does not enjoy life's good things, and also has no burial, I say that an untimely birth is better off than he. 
ECC.6.4	For it comes into vanity and goes into darkness, and in darkness its name is covered; 
ECC.6.5	moreover it has not seen the sun or known anything; yet it finds rest rather than he. 
ECC.6.6	Even though he should live a thousand years twice told, yet enjoy no good—do not all go to the one place?
ECC.6.7	All the toil of man is for his mouth, yet his appetite is not satisfied. 
ECC.6.8	For what advantage has the wise man over the fool? And what does the poor man have who knows how to conduct himself before the living? 
ECC.6.9	Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of desire; this also is vanity and a striving after wind.
ECC.6.10	Whatever has come to be has already been named, and it is known what man is, and that he is not able to dispute with one stronger than he. 
ECC.6.11	The more words, the more vanity, and what is man the better? 
ECC.6.12	For who knows what is good for man while he lives the few days of his vain life, which he passes like a shadow? For who can tell man what will be after him under the sun?
ECC.7.1	A good name is better than precious ointment;
ECC.7.1	and the day of death, than the day of birth.
ECC.7.2	It is better to go to the house of mourning
ECC.7.2	than to go to the house of feasting;
ECC.7.2	for this is the end of all men,
ECC.7.2	and the living will lay it to heart.
ECC.7.3	Sorrow is better than laughter,
ECC.7.3	for by sadness of countenance the heart is made glad.
ECC.7.4	The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning;
ECC.7.4	but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.
ECC.7.5	It is better for a man to hear the rebuke of the wise
ECC.7.5	than to hear the song of fools.
ECC.7.6	For as the crackling of thorns under a pot,
ECC.7.6	so is the laughter of the fools;
ECC.7.6	this also is vanity.
ECC.7.7	Surely oppression makes the wise man foolish,
ECC.7.7	and a bribe corrupts the mind.
ECC.7.8	Better is the end of a thing than its beginning;
ECC.7.8	and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
ECC.7.9	Be not quick to anger,
ECC.7.9	for anger lodges in the bosom of fools.
ECC.7.10	Say not, “Why were the former days better than these?”
ECC.7.10	For it is not from wisdom that you ask this.
ECC.7.11	Wisdom is good with an inheritance,
ECC.7.11	an advantage to those who see the sun.
ECC.7.12	For the protection of wisdom is like the protection of money;
ECC.7.12	and the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of him who has it.
ECC.7.13	Consider the work of God;
ECC.7.13	who can make straight what he has made crooked?
ECC.7.14	In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; God has made the one as well as the other, so that man may not find out anything that will be after him.
ECC.7.15	In my vain life I have seen everything; there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his evil-doing. 
ECC.7.16	Be not righteous overmuch, and do not make yourself overwise; why should you destroy yourself? 
ECC.7.17	Be not wicked overmuch, neither be a fool; why should you die before your time? 
ECC.7.18	It is good that you should take hold of this, and from that withhold not your hand; for he who fears God shall come forth from them all.
ECC.7.19	Wisdom gives strength to the wise man more than ten rulers that are in a city.
ECC.7.20	Surely there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins.
ECC.7.21	Do not give heed to all the things that men say, lest you hear your servant cursing you; 
ECC.7.22	your heart knows that many times you have yourself cursed others.
ECC.7.23	All this I have tested by wisdom; I said, “I will be wise”; but it was far from me. 
ECC.7.24	That which is, is far off, and deep, very deep; who can find it out? 
ECC.7.25	I turned my mind to know and to search out and to seek wisdom and the sum of things, and to know the wickedness of folly and the foolishness which is madness. 
ECC.7.26	And I found more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and whose hands are fetters; he who pleases God escapes her, but the sinner is taken by her. 
ECC.7.27	Behold, this is what I found, says the Preacher, adding one thing to another to find the sum, 
ECC.7.28	which my mind has sought repeatedly, but I have not found. One man among a thousand I found, but a woman among all these I have not found. 
ECC.7.29	Behold, this alone I found, that God made man upright, but they have sought out many devices.
ECC.8.1	Who is like the wise man?
ECC.8.1	And who knows the interpretation of a thing?
ECC.8.1	A man's wisdom makes his face shine,
ECC.8.1	and the hardness of his countenance is changed.
ECC.8.2	Keep
ECC.8.3	go from his presence, do not delay when the matter is unpleasant, for he does whatever he pleases. 
ECC.8.4	For the word of the king is supreme, and who may say to him, “What are you doing?” 
ECC.8.5	He who obeys a command will meet no harm, and the mind of a wise man will know the time and way. 
ECC.8.6	For every matter has its time and way, although man's trouble lies heavy upon him. 
ECC.8.7	For he does not know what is to be, for who can tell him how it will be? 
ECC.8.8	No man has power to retain the spirit, or authority over the day of death; there is no discharge from war, nor will wickedness deliver those who are given to it. 
ECC.8.9	All this I observed while applying my mind to all that is done under the sun, while man lords it over man to his hurt.
ECC.8.10	Then I saw the wicked buried; they used to go in and out of the holy place, and were praised in the city where they had done such things. This also is vanity. 
ECC.8.11	Because sentence against an evil deed is not executed speedily, the heart of the sons of men is fully set to do evil. 
ECC.8.12	Though a sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs his life, yet I know that it will be well with those who fear God, because they fear before him; 
ECC.8.13	but it will not be well with the wicked, neither will he prolong his days like a shadow, because he does not fear before God.
ECC.8.14	There is a vanity which takes place on earth, that there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked, and there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity. 
ECC.8.15	And I commend enjoyment, for man has no good thing under the sun but to eat and drink and enjoy himself, for this will go with him in his toil through the days of life which God gives him under the sun.
ECC.8.16	When I applied my mind to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done on earth, how neither day nor night one's eyes see sleep; 
ECC.8.17	then I saw all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun. However much man may toil in seeking, he will not find it out; even though a wise man claims to know, he cannot find it out.
ECC.9.1	But all this I laid to heart, examining it all, how the righteous and the wise and their deeds are in the hand of God; whether it is love or hate man does not know. Everything before them is vanity,
ECC.9.2	since one fate comes to all, to the righteous and the wicked, to the good and the evil,
ECC.9.3	This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that one fate comes to all; also the hearts of men are full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead. 
ECC.9.4	But he who is joined with all the living has hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion. 
ECC.9.5	For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing, and they have no more reward; but the memory of them is lost. 
ECC.9.6	Their love and their hate and their envy have already perished, and they have no more for ever any share in all that is done under the sun.
ECC.9.7	Go, eat your bread with enjoyment, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God has already approved what you do.
ECC.9.8	Let your garments be always white; let not oil be lacking on your head.
ECC.9.9	Enjoy life with the wife whom you love, all the days of your vain life which he has given you under the sun, because that is your portion in life and in your toil at which you toil under the sun. 
ECC.9.10	Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, to which you are going.
ECC.9.11	Again I saw that under the sun the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the intelligent, nor favor to the men of skill; but time and chance happen to them all. 
ECC.9.12	For man does not know his time. Like fish which are taken in an evil net, and like birds which are caught in a snare, so the sons of men are snared at an evil time, when it suddenly falls upon them.
ECC.9.13	I have also seen this example of wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me. 
ECC.9.14	There was a little city with few men in it; and a great king came against it and besieged it, building great siegeworks against it. 
ECC.9.15	But there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city. Yet no one remembered that poor man. 
ECC.9.16	But I say that wisdom is better than might, though the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heeded.
ECC.9.17	The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools. 
ECC.9.18	Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.
ECC.10.1	Dead flies make the perfumer's ointment give off an evil odor;
ECC.10.1	so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.
ECC.10.2	A wise man's heart inclines him toward the right,
ECC.10.2	but a fool's heart toward the left.
ECC.10.3	Even when the fool walks on the road, he lacks sense,
ECC.10.3	and he says to every one that he is a fool.
ECC.10.4	If the anger of the ruler rises against you, do not leave your place,
ECC.10.4	for deference will make amends for great offenses.
ECC.10.5	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as it were an error proceeding from the ruler: 
ECC.10.6	folly is set in many high places, and the rich sit in a low place. 
ECC.10.7	I have seen slaves on horses, and princes walking on foot like slaves.
ECC.10.8	He who digs a pit will fall into it;
ECC.10.8	and a serpent will bite him who breaks through a wall.
ECC.10.9	He who quarries stones is hurt by them;
ECC.10.9	and he who splits logs is endangered by them.
ECC.10.10	If the iron is blunt, and one does not whet the edge,
ECC.10.10	he must put forth more strength;
ECC.10.10	but wisdom helps one to succeed.
ECC.10.11	If the serpent bites before it is charmed,
ECC.10.11	there is no advantage in a charmer.
ECC.10.12	The words of a wise man's mouth win him favor,
ECC.10.12	but the lips of a fool consume him.
ECC.10.13	The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness,
ECC.10.13	and the end of his talk is wicked madness.
ECC.10.14	A fool multiplies words,
ECC.10.14	though no man knows what is to be,
ECC.10.14	and who can tell him what will be after him?
ECC.10.15	The toil of a fool wearies him,
ECC.10.15	so that he does not know the way to the city.
ECC.10.16	Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child,
ECC.10.16	and your princes feast in the morning!
ECC.10.17	Happy are you, O land, when your king is the son of free men,
ECC.10.17	and your princes feast at the proper time,
ECC.10.17	for strength, and not for drunkenness!
ECC.10.18	Through sloth the roof sinks in,
ECC.10.18	and through indolence the house leaks.
ECC.10.19	Bread is made for laughter,
ECC.10.19	and wine gladdens life,
ECC.10.19	and money answers everything.
ECC.10.20	Even in your thought, do not curse the king,
ECC.10.20	nor in your bedchamber curse the rich;
ECC.10.20	for a bird of the air will carry your voice,
ECC.10.20	or some winged creature tell the matter.
ECC.11.1	Cast your bread upon the waters,
ECC.11.1	for you will find it after many days.
ECC.11.2	Give a portion to seven, or even to eight,
ECC.11.2	for you know not what evil may happen on earth.
ECC.11.3	If the clouds are full of rain,
ECC.11.3	they empty themselves on the earth;
ECC.11.3	and if a tree falls to the south or to the north,
ECC.11.3	in the place where the tree falls, there it will lie.
ECC.11.4	He who observes the wind will not sow;
ECC.11.4	and he who regards the clouds will not reap.
ECC.11.5	As you do not know how the spirit comes to the bones in the womb
ECC.11.6	In the morning sow your seed, and at evening withhold not your hand; for you do not know which will prosper, this or that, or whether both alike will be good.
ECC.11.7	Light is sweet, and it is pleasant for the eyes to behold the sun.
ECC.11.8	For if a man lives many years, let him rejoice in them all; but let him remember that the days of darkness will be many. All that comes is vanity.
ECC.11.9	Rejoice, O young man, in your youth, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth; walk in the ways of your heart and the sight of your eyes. But know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.
ECC.11.10	Remove vexation from your mind, and put away pain from your body; for youth and the dawn of life are vanity.
ECC.12.1	Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, when you will say, “I have no pleasure in them”; 
ECC.12.2	before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are darkened and the clouds return after the rain; 
ECC.12.3	in the day when the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men are bent, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look through the windows are dimmed, 
ECC.12.4	and the doors on the street are shut; when the sound of the grinding is low, and one rises up at the voice of a bird, and all the daughters of song are brought low; 
ECC.12.5	they are afraid also of what is high, and terrors are in the way; the almond tree blossoms, the grasshopper drags itself along
ECC.12.6	before the silver cord is snapped,
ECC.12.7	and the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it. 
ECC.12.8	Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher; all is vanity.
ECC.12.9	Besides being wise, the Preacher also taught the people knowledge, weighing and studying and arranging proverbs with great care. 
ECC.12.10	The Preacher sought to find pleasing words, and uprightly he wrote words of truth.
ECC.12.11	The sayings of the wise are like goads, and like nails firmly fixed are the collected sayings which are given by one Shepherd. 
ECC.12.12	My son, beware of anything beyond these. Of making many books there is no end, and much study is a weariness of the flesh.
ECC.12.13	The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man.
ECC.12.14	For God will bring every deed into judgment, with
SNG.1.1	The Song of Songs, which is Solomon's.
SNG.1.2	O that you
SNG.1.2	For your love is better than wine,
SNG.1.3	your anointing oils are fragrant,
SNG.1.3	your name is oil poured out;
SNG.1.3	therefore the maidens love you.
SNG.1.4	Draw me after you, let us make haste.
SNG.1.4	The king has brought me into his chambers.
SNG.1.4	We will exult and rejoice in you;
SNG.1.4	we will extol your love more than wine;
SNG.1.4	rightly do they love you.
SNG.1.5	I am very dark, but comely,
SNG.1.5	O daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.1.5	like the tents of Kedar,
SNG.1.5	like the curtains of Solomon.
SNG.1.6	Do not gaze at me because I am swarthy,
SNG.1.6	because the sun has scorched me.
SNG.1.6	My mother's sons were angry with me,
SNG.1.6	they made me keeper of the vineyards;
SNG.1.6	but, my own vineyard I have not kept!
SNG.1.7	Tell me, you whom my soul loves,
SNG.1.7	where you pasture your flock,
SNG.1.7	where you make it lie down at noon;
SNG.1.7	for why should I be like one who wanders
SNG.1.7	beside the flocks of your companions?
SNG.1.8	If you do not know,
SNG.1.8	O fairest among women,
SNG.1.8	follow in the tracks of the flock,
SNG.1.8	and pasture your kids
SNG.1.8	beside the shepherds' tents.
SNG.1.9	I compare you, my love,
SNG.1.9	to a mare of Pharaoh's chariots.
SNG.1.10	Your cheeks are comely with ornaments,
SNG.1.10	your neck with strings of jewels.
SNG.1.11	We will make you ornaments of gold,
SNG.1.11	studded with silver.
SNG.1.12	While the king was on his couch,
SNG.1.12	my nard gave forth its fragrance.
SNG.1.13	My beloved is to me a bag of myrrh,
SNG.1.13	that lies between my breasts.
SNG.1.14	My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms
SNG.1.14	in the vineyards of En-gedi.
SNG.1.15	Behold, you are beautiful, my love;
SNG.1.15	behold, you are beautiful;
SNG.1.15	your eyes are doves.
SNG.1.16	Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, truly lovely.
SNG.1.16	Our couch is green;
SNG.1.17	the beams of our house are cedar,
SNG.1.17	our rafters
SNG.2.1	I am a rose
SNG.2.1	a lily of the valleys.
SNG.2.2	As a lily among brambles,
SNG.2.2	so is my love among maidens.
SNG.2.3	As an apple tree among the trees of the wood,
SNG.2.3	so is my beloved among young men.
SNG.2.3	With great delight I sat in his shadow,
SNG.2.3	and his fruit was sweet to my taste,
SNG.2.4	He brought me to the banqueting house,
SNG.2.4	and his banner over me was love.
SNG.2.5	Sustain me with raisins,
SNG.2.5	refresh me with apples;
SNG.2.5	for I am sick with love.
SNG.2.6	O that his left hand were under my head,
SNG.2.6	and that his right hand embraced me!
SNG.2.7	I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.2.7	by the gazelles or the hinds of the field,
SNG.2.7	that you stir not up nor awaken love
SNG.2.7	until it please.
SNG.2.8	The voice of my beloved!
SNG.2.8	Behold, he comes,
SNG.2.8	leaping upon the mountains,
SNG.2.8	bounding over the hills.
SNG.2.9	My beloved is like a gazelle,
SNG.2.9	or a young stag.
SNG.2.9	Behold, there he stands
SNG.2.9	behind our wall,
SNG.2.9	gazing in at the windows,
SNG.2.9	looking through the lattice.
SNG.2.10	My beloved speaks and says to me:
SNG.2.10	“Arise, my love, my fair one,
SNG.2.10	and come away;
SNG.2.11	for lo, the winter is past,
SNG.2.11	the rain is over and gone.
SNG.2.12	The flowers appear on the earth,
SNG.2.12	the time of singing has come,
SNG.2.12	and the voice of the turtledove
SNG.2.12	is heard in our land.
SNG.2.13	The fig tree puts forth its figs,
SNG.2.13	and the vines are in blossom;
SNG.2.13	they give forth fragrance.
SNG.2.13	Arise, my love, my fair one,
SNG.2.13	and come away.
SNG.2.14	O my dove, in the clefts of the rock,
SNG.2.14	in the covert of the cliff,
SNG.2.14	let me see your face,
SNG.2.14	let me hear your voice,
SNG.2.14	for your voice is sweet,
SNG.2.14	and your face is comely.
SNG.2.15	Catch us the foxes,
SNG.2.15	the little foxes,
SNG.2.15	that spoil the vineyards,
SNG.2.15	for our vineyards are in blossom.”
SNG.2.16	My beloved is mine and I am his,
SNG.2.16	he pastures his flock among the lilies.
SNG.2.17	Until the day breathe
SNG.2.17	and the shadows flee,
SNG.2.17	turn, my beloved, be like a gazelle,
SNG.2.17	or a young stag upon rugged
SNG.3.1	Upon my bed by night
SNG.3.1	I sought him whom my soul loves;
SNG.3.1	I sought him, but found him not;
SNG.3.1	I called him, but he gave no answer.
SNG.3.2	“I will rise now and go about the city,
SNG.3.2	in the streets and in the squares;
SNG.3.2	I will seek him whom my soul loves.”
SNG.3.2	I sought him, but found him not.
SNG.3.3	The watchmen found me,
SNG.3.3	as they went about in the city.
SNG.3.3	“Have you seen him whom my soul loves?”
SNG.3.4	Scarcely had I passed them,
SNG.3.4	when I found him whom my soul loves.
SNG.3.4	I held him, and would not let him go
SNG.3.4	until I had brought him into my mother's house,
SNG.3.4	and into the chamber of her that conceived me.
SNG.3.5	I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.3.5	by the gazelles or the hinds of the field,
SNG.3.5	that you stir not up nor awaken love
SNG.3.5	until it please.
SNG.3.6	What is that coming up from the wilderness,
SNG.3.6	like a column of smoke,
SNG.3.6	perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,
SNG.3.6	with all the fragrant powders of the merchant?
SNG.3.7	Behold, it is the litter of Solomon!
SNG.3.7	About it are sixty mighty men
SNG.3.7	of the mighty men of Israel,
SNG.3.8	all girt with swords
SNG.3.8	and expert in war,
SNG.3.8	each with his sword at his thigh,
SNG.3.8	against alarms by night.
SNG.3.9	King Solomon made himself a palanquin
SNG.3.9	from the wood of Lebanon.
SNG.3.10	He made its posts of silver,
SNG.3.10	its back of gold, its seat of purple;
SNG.3.10	it was lovingly wrought within
SNG.3.10	by the daughters of Jerusalem.
SNG.3.11	Go forth, O daughters of Zion,
SNG.3.11	and behold King Solomon,
SNG.3.11	with the crown with which his mother crowned him
SNG.3.11	on the day of his wedding,
SNG.3.11	on the day of the gladness of his heart.
SNG.4.1	Behold, you are beautiful, my love,
SNG.4.1	behold, you are beautiful!
SNG.4.1	Your eyes are doves
SNG.4.1	behind your veil.
SNG.4.1	Your hair is like a flock of goats,
SNG.4.1	moving down the slopes of Gilead.
SNG.4.2	Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes
SNG.4.2	that have come up from the washing,
SNG.4.2	all of which bear twins,
SNG.4.2	and not one among them is bereaved.
SNG.4.3	Your lips are like a scarlet thread,
SNG.4.3	and your mouth is lovely.
SNG.4.3	Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate
SNG.4.3	behind your veil.
SNG.4.4	Your neck is like the tower of David,
SNG.4.4	built for an arsenal,
SNG.4.4	whereon hang a thousand bucklers,
SNG.4.4	all of them shields of warriors.
SNG.4.5	Your two breasts are like two fawns,
SNG.4.5	twins of a gazelle,
SNG.4.5	that feed among the lilies.
SNG.4.6	Until the day breathes
SNG.4.6	and the shadows flee,
SNG.4.6	I will hie me to the mountain of myrrh
SNG.4.6	and the hill of frankincense.
SNG.4.7	You are all fair, my love;
SNG.4.7	there is no flaw in you.
SNG.4.8	Come with me from Lebanon, my bride;
SNG.4.8	come with me from Lebanon.
SNG.4.8	Depart
SNG.4.8	from the peak of Senir and Hermon,
SNG.4.8	from the dens of lions,
SNG.4.8	from the mountains of leopards.
SNG.4.9	You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride,
SNG.4.9	you have ravished my heart with a glance of your eyes,
SNG.4.9	with one jewel of your necklace.
SNG.4.10	How sweet is your love, my sister, my bride!
SNG.4.10	how much better is your love than wine,
SNG.4.10	and the fragrance of your oils than any spice!
SNG.4.11	Your lips distil nectar, my bride;
SNG.4.11	honey and milk are under your tongue;
SNG.4.11	the scent of your garments is like the scent of Lebanon.
SNG.4.12	A garden locked is my sister, my bride,
SNG.4.12	a garden locked, a fountain sealed.
SNG.4.13	Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates
SNG.4.13	with all choicest fruits,
SNG.4.13	henna with nard,
SNG.4.14	nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon,
SNG.4.14	with all trees of frankincense,
SNG.4.14	myrrh and aloes,
SNG.4.14	with all chief spices—
SNG.4.15	a garden fountain, a well of living water,
SNG.4.15	and flowing streams from Lebanon.
SNG.4.16	Awake, O north wind,
SNG.4.16	and come, O south wind!
SNG.4.16	Blow upon my garden,
SNG.4.16	let its fragrance be wafted abroad.
SNG.4.16	Let my beloved come to his garden,
SNG.4.16	and eat its choicest fruits.
SNG.5.1	I come to my garden, my sister, my bride,
SNG.5.1	I gather my myrrh with my spice,
SNG.5.1	I eat my honeycomb with my honey,
SNG.5.1	I drink my wine with my milk.
SNG.5.1	Eat, O friends, and drink:
SNG.5.1	drink deeply, O lovers!
SNG.5.2	I slept, but my heart was awake.
SNG.5.2	Hark! my beloved is knocking.
SNG.5.2	“Open to me, my sister, my love,
SNG.5.2	my dove, my perfect one;
SNG.5.2	for my head is wet with dew,
SNG.5.2	my locks with the drops of the night.”
SNG.5.3	I had put off my garment,
SNG.5.3	how could I put it on?
SNG.5.3	I had bathed my feet,
SNG.5.3	how could I soil them?
SNG.5.4	My beloved put his hand to the latch,
SNG.5.4	and my heart was thrilled within me.
SNG.5.5	I arose to open to my beloved,
SNG.5.5	and my hands dripped with myrrh,
SNG.5.5	my fingers with liquid myrrh,
SNG.5.5	upon the handles of the bolt.
SNG.5.6	I opened to my beloved,
SNG.5.6	but my beloved had turned and gone.
SNG.5.6	My soul failed me when he spoke.
SNG.5.6	I sought him, but found him not;
SNG.5.6	I called him, but he gave no answer.
SNG.5.7	The watchmen found me,
SNG.5.7	as they went about in the city;
SNG.5.7	they beat me, they wounded me,
SNG.5.7	they took away my mantle,
SNG.5.7	those watchmen of the walls.
SNG.5.8	I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.5.8	if you find my beloved,
SNG.5.8	that you tell him
SNG.5.8	I am sick with love.
SNG.5.9	What is your beloved more than another beloved,
SNG.5.9	O fairest among women?
SNG.5.9	What is your beloved more than another beloved,
SNG.5.9	that you thus adjure us?
SNG.5.10	My beloved is all radiant and ruddy,
SNG.5.10	distinguished among ten thousand.
SNG.5.11	His head is the finest gold;
SNG.5.11	his locks are wavy,
SNG.5.11	black as a raven.
SNG.5.12	His eyes are like doves
SNG.5.12	beside springs of water,
SNG.5.12	bathed in milk,
SNG.5.12	fitly set.
SNG.5.13	His cheeks are like beds of spices,
SNG.5.13	yielding fragrance.
SNG.5.13	His lips are lilies,
SNG.5.13	distilling liquid myrrh.
SNG.5.14	His arms are rounded gold,
SNG.5.14	set with jewels.
SNG.5.14	His body is ivory work,
SNG.5.14	encrusted with sapphires.
SNG.5.15	His legs are alabaster columns,
SNG.5.15	set upon bases of gold.
SNG.5.15	His appearance is like Lebanon,
SNG.5.15	choice as the cedars.
SNG.5.16	His speech is most sweet,
SNG.5.16	and he is altogether desirable.
SNG.5.16	This is my beloved and this is my friend,
SNG.5.16	O daughters of Jerusalem.
SNG.6.1	Whither has your beloved gone,
SNG.6.1	O fairest among women?
SNG.6.1	Whither has your beloved turned,
SNG.6.1	that we may seek him with you?
SNG.6.2	My beloved has gone down to his garden,
SNG.6.2	to the beds of spices,
SNG.6.2	to pasture his flock in the gardens,
SNG.6.2	and to gather lilies.
SNG.6.3	I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine;
SNG.6.3	he pastures his flock among the lilies.
SNG.6.4	You are beautiful as Tirzah, my love,
SNG.6.4	comely as Jerusalem,
SNG.6.4	terrible as an army with banners.
SNG.6.5	Turn away your eyes from me,
SNG.6.5	for they disturb me—
SNG.6.5	Your hair is like a flock of goats,
SNG.6.5	moving down the slopes of Gilead.
SNG.6.6	Your teeth are like a flock of ewes,
SNG.6.6	that have come up from the washing,
SNG.6.6	all of them bear twins,
SNG.6.6	not one among them is bereaved.
SNG.6.7	Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate
SNG.6.7	behind your veil.
SNG.6.8	There are sixty queens and eighty concubines,
SNG.6.8	and maidens without number.
SNG.6.9	My dove, my perfect one, is only one,
SNG.6.9	the darling of her mother,
SNG.6.9	flawless to her that bore her.
SNG.6.9	The maidens saw her and called her happy;
SNG.6.9	the queens and concubines also, and they praised her.
SNG.6.10	“Who is this that looks forth like the dawn,
SNG.6.10	fair as the moon, bright as the sun,
SNG.6.10	terrible as an army with banners?”
SNG.6.11	I went down to the nut orchard,
SNG.6.11	to look at the blossoms of the valley,
SNG.6.11	to see whether the vines had budded,
SNG.6.11	whether the pomegranates were in bloom.
SNG.6.12	Before I was aware, my fancy set me
SNG.6.12	in a chariot beside my prince.
SNG.6.13	return, return, that we may look upon you.
SNG.6.13	Why should you look upon the Shulammite,
SNG.6.13	as upon a dance before two armies?
SNG.7.1	How graceful are your feet in sandals,
SNG.7.1	O queenly maiden!
SNG.7.1	Your rounded thighs are like jewels,
SNG.7.1	the work of a master hand.
SNG.7.2	Your navel is a rounded bowl
SNG.7.2	that never lacks mixed wine.
SNG.7.2	Your belly is a heap of wheat,
SNG.7.2	encircled with lilies.
SNG.7.3	Your two breasts are like two fawns,
SNG.7.3	twins of a gazelle.
SNG.7.4	Your neck is like an ivory tower.
SNG.7.4	Your eyes are pools in Heshbon,
SNG.7.4	by the gate of Bath-rabbim.
SNG.7.4	Your nose is like a tower of Lebanon,
SNG.7.4	overlooking Damascus.
SNG.7.5	Your head crowns you like Carmel,
SNG.7.5	and your flowing locks are like purple;
SNG.7.5	a king is held captive in the tresses.
SNG.7.6	How fair and pleasant you are,
SNG.7.6	O loved one, delectable maiden!
SNG.7.7	You are stately
SNG.7.7	and your breasts are like its clusters.
SNG.7.8	I say I will climb the palm tree
SNG.7.8	and lay hold of its branches.
SNG.7.8	Oh, may your breasts be like clusters of the vine,
SNG.7.8	and the scent of your breath like apples,
SNG.7.9	and your kisses
SNG.7.9	that goes down
SNG.7.9	gliding over lips and teeth.
SNG.7.10	I am my beloved's,
SNG.7.10	and his desire is for me.
SNG.7.11	Come, my beloved,
SNG.7.11	let us go forth into the fields,
SNG.7.11	and lodge in the villages;
SNG.7.12	let us go out early to the vineyards,
SNG.7.12	and see whether the vines have budded,
SNG.7.12	whether the grape blossoms have opened
SNG.7.12	and the pomegranates are in bloom.
SNG.7.12	There I will give you my love.
SNG.7.13	The mandrakes give forth fragrance,
SNG.7.13	and over our doors are all choice fruits,
SNG.7.13	new as well as old,
SNG.7.13	which I have laid up for you, O my beloved.
SNG.8.1	O that you were like a brother to me,
SNG.8.1	that nursed at my mother's breast!
SNG.8.1	If I met you outside, I would kiss you,
SNG.8.1	and none would despise me.
SNG.8.2	I would lead you and bring you
SNG.8.2	into the house of my mother,
SNG.8.2	and into the chamber of her that conceived me.
SNG.8.2	I would give you spiced wine to drink,
SNG.8.2	the juice of my pomegranates.
SNG.8.3	O that his left hand were under my head,
SNG.8.3	and that his right hand embraced me!
SNG.8.4	I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.8.4	that you stir not up nor awaken love
SNG.8.4	until it please.
SNG.8.5	Who is that coming up from the wilderness,
SNG.8.5	leaning upon her beloved?
SNG.8.5	Under the apple tree I awakened you.
SNG.8.5	There your mother was in travail with you,
SNG.8.5	there she who bore you was in travail.
SNG.8.6	Set me as a seal upon your heart,
SNG.8.6	as a seal upon your arm;
SNG.8.6	for love is strong as death,
SNG.8.6	jealousy is cruel as the grave.
SNG.8.6	Its flashes are flashes of fire,
SNG.8.6	a most vehement flame.
SNG.8.7	Many waters cannot quench love,
SNG.8.7	neither can floods drown it.
SNG.8.7	If a man offered for love
SNG.8.7	all the wealth of his house,
SNG.8.7	it would be utterly scorned.
SNG.8.8	We have a little sister,
SNG.8.8	and she has no breasts.
SNG.8.8	What shall we do for our sister,
SNG.8.8	on the day when she is spoken for?
SNG.8.9	If she is a wall,
SNG.8.9	we will build upon her a battlement of silver;
SNG.8.9	but if she is a door,
SNG.8.9	we will enclose her with boards of cedar.
SNG.8.10	I was a wall,
SNG.8.10	and my breasts were like towers;
SNG.8.10	then I was in his eyes
SNG.8.10	as one who brings
SNG.8.11	Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon;
SNG.8.11	he let out the vineyard to keepers;
SNG.8.11	each one was to bring for its fruit a thousand pieces of silver.
SNG.8.12	My vineyard, my very own, is for myself;
SNG.8.12	you, O Solomon, may have the thousand,
SNG.8.12	and the keepers of the fruit two hundred.
SNG.8.13	O you who dwell in the gardens,
SNG.8.13	my companions are listening for your voice;
SNG.8.13	let me hear it.
SNG.8.14	Make haste, my beloved,
SNG.8.14	and be like a gazelle
SNG.8.14	or a young stag
SNG.8.14	upon the mountains of spices.
ISA.1.1	The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
ISA.1.2	Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth;
ISA.1.2	for the 
ISA.1.2	“Sons have I reared and brought up,
ISA.1.2	but they have rebelled against me.
ISA.1.3	The ox knows its owner,
ISA.1.3	and the ass its master's crib;
ISA.1.3	but Israel does not know,
ISA.1.3	my people does not understand.”
ISA.1.4	Ah, sinful nation,
ISA.1.4	a people laden with iniquity,
ISA.1.4	offspring of evildoers,
ISA.1.4	sons who deal corruptly!
ISA.1.4	They have forsaken the 
ISA.1.4	they have despised the Holy One of Israel,
ISA.1.4	they are utterly estranged.
ISA.1.5	Why will you still be smitten,
ISA.1.5	that you continue to rebel?
ISA.1.5	The whole head is sick,
ISA.1.5	and the whole heart faint.
ISA.1.6	From the sole of the foot even to the head,
ISA.1.6	there is no soundness in it,
ISA.1.6	but bruises and sores
ISA.1.6	and bleeding wounds;
ISA.1.6	they are not pressed out, or bound up,
ISA.1.6	or softened with oil.
ISA.1.7	Your country lies desolate,
ISA.1.7	your cities are burned with fire;
ISA.1.7	in your very presence
ISA.1.7	aliens devour your land;
ISA.1.7	it is desolate, as overthrown by aliens.
ISA.1.8	And the daughter of Zion is left
ISA.1.8	like a booth in a vineyard,
ISA.1.8	like a lodge in a cucumber field,
ISA.1.8	like a besieged city.
ISA.1.9	had not left us a few survivors,
ISA.1.9	we should have been like Sodom,
ISA.1.9	and become like Gomorrah.
ISA.1.10	Hear the word of the 
ISA.1.10	you rulers of Sodom!
ISA.1.10	Give ear to the teaching of our God,
ISA.1.10	you people of Gomorrah!
ISA.1.11	“What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices?
ISA.1.11	says the 
ISA.1.11	I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams
ISA.1.11	and the fat of fed beasts;
ISA.1.11	I do not delight in the blood of bulls,
ISA.1.11	or of lambs, or of he-goats.
ISA.1.12	“When you come to appear before me,
ISA.1.12	who requires of you
ISA.1.12	this trampling of my courts?
ISA.1.13	Bring no more vain offerings;
ISA.1.13	incense is an abomination to me.
ISA.1.13	New moon and sabbath and the calling of assemblies—
ISA.1.13	I cannot endure iniquity and solemn assembly.
ISA.1.14	Your new moons and your appointed feasts
ISA.1.14	my soul hates;
ISA.1.14	they have become a burden to me,
ISA.1.14	I am weary of bearing them.
ISA.1.15	When you spread forth your hands,
ISA.1.15	I will hide my eyes from you;
ISA.1.15	even though you make many prayers,
ISA.1.15	I will not listen;
ISA.1.15	your hands are full of blood.
ISA.1.16	Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean;
ISA.1.16	remove the evil of your doings
ISA.1.16	from before my eyes;
ISA.1.16	cease to do evil,
ISA.1.17	learn to do good;
ISA.1.17	seek justice,
ISA.1.17	correct oppression;
ISA.1.17	defend the fatherless,
ISA.1.17	plead for the widow.
ISA.1.18	“Come now, let us reason together,
ISA.1.18	says the 
ISA.1.18	though your sins are like scarlet,
ISA.1.18	they shall be as white as snow;
ISA.1.18	though they are red like crimson,
ISA.1.18	they shall become like wool.
ISA.1.19	If you are willing and obedient,
ISA.1.19	you shall eat the good of the land;
ISA.1.20	but if you refuse and rebel,
ISA.1.20	you shall be devoured by the sword;
ISA.1.20	for the mouth of the 
ISA.1.21	How the faithful city
ISA.1.21	has become a harlot,
ISA.1.21	she that was full of justice!
ISA.1.21	Righteousness lodged in her,
ISA.1.21	but now murderers.
ISA.1.22	Your silver has become dross,
ISA.1.22	your wine mixed with water.
ISA.1.23	Your princes are rebels
ISA.1.23	and companions of thieves.
ISA.1.23	Every one loves a bribe
ISA.1.23	and runs after gifts.
ISA.1.23	They do not defend the fatherless,
ISA.1.23	and the widow's cause does not come to them.
ISA.1.24	Therefore the Lord says,
ISA.1.24	the 
ISA.1.24	the Mighty One of Israel:
ISA.1.24	“Ah, I will vent my wrath on my enemies,
ISA.1.24	and avenge myself on my foes.
ISA.1.25	I will turn my hand against you
ISA.1.25	and will smelt away your dross as with lye
ISA.1.25	and remove all your alloy.
ISA.1.26	And I will restore your judges as at the first,
ISA.1.26	and your counselors as at the beginning.
ISA.1.26	Afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness,
ISA.1.26	the faithful city.”
ISA.1.27	Zion shall be redeemed by justice,
ISA.1.27	and those in her who repent, by righteousness.
ISA.1.28	But rebels and sinners shall be destroyed together,
ISA.1.28	and those who forsake the 
ISA.1.29	For you shall be ashamed of the oaks
ISA.1.29	in which you delighted;
ISA.1.29	and you shall blush for the gardens
ISA.1.29	which you have chosen.
ISA.1.30	For you shall be like an oak
ISA.1.30	whose leaf withers,
ISA.1.30	and like a garden without water.
ISA.1.31	And the strong shall become tow,
ISA.1.31	and his work a spark,
ISA.1.31	and both of them shall burn together,
ISA.1.31	with none to quench them.
ISA.2.1	The word which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
ISA.2.2	that the mountain of the house of the 
ISA.2.2	shall be established as the highest of the mountains,
ISA.2.2	and shall be raised above the hills;
ISA.2.2	and all the nations shall flow to it,
ISA.2.3	and many peoples shall come, and say:
ISA.2.3	“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the 
ISA.2.3	to the house of the God of Jacob;
ISA.2.3	that he may teach us his ways
ISA.2.3	and that we may walk in his paths.”
ISA.2.3	For out of Zion shall go forth the law,
ISA.2.3	and the word of the 
ISA.2.4	He shall judge between the nations,
ISA.2.4	and shall decide for many peoples;
ISA.2.4	and they shall beat their swords into plowshares,
ISA.2.4	and their spears into pruning hooks;
ISA.2.4	nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
ISA.2.4	neither shall they learn war any more.
ISA.2.5	O house of Jacob,
ISA.2.5	come, let us walk
ISA.2.5	in the light of the 
ISA.2.6	For thou hast rejected thy people,
ISA.2.6	the house of Jacob,
ISA.2.6	because they are full of diviners
ISA.2.6	and of soothsayers like the Philistines,
ISA.2.6	and they strike hands with foreigners.
ISA.2.7	Their land is filled with silver and gold,
ISA.2.7	and there is no end to their treasures;
ISA.2.7	their land is filled with horses,
ISA.2.7	and there is no end to their chariots.
ISA.2.8	Their land is filled with idols;
ISA.2.8	they bow down to the work of their hands,
ISA.2.8	to what their own fingers have made.
ISA.2.9	So man is humbled,
ISA.2.9	and men are brought low—
ISA.2.9	forgive them not!
ISA.2.10	Enter into the rock,
ISA.2.10	and hide in the dust
ISA.2.10	from before the terror of the 
ISA.2.10	and from the glory of his majesty.
ISA.2.11	The haughty looks of man shall be brought low,
ISA.2.11	and the pride of men shall be humbled;
ISA.2.11	and the 
ISA.2.12	For the 
ISA.2.12	against all that is proud and lofty,
ISA.2.12	against all that is lifted up and high;
ISA.2.13	against all the cedars of Lebanon,
ISA.2.13	lofty and lifted up;
ISA.2.13	and against all the oaks of Bashan;
ISA.2.14	against all the high mountains,
ISA.2.14	and against all the lofty hills;
ISA.2.15	against every high tower,
ISA.2.15	and against every fortified wall;
ISA.2.16	against all the ships of Tarshish,
ISA.2.16	and against all the beautiful craft.
ISA.2.17	And the haughtiness of man shall be humbled,
ISA.2.17	and the pride of men shall be brought low;
ISA.2.17	and the 
ISA.2.18	And the idols shall utterly pass away.
ISA.2.19	And men shall enter the caves of the rocks
ISA.2.19	and the holes of the ground,
ISA.2.19	from before the terror of the 
ISA.2.19	and from the glory of his majesty,
ISA.2.19	when he rises to terrify the earth.
ISA.2.20	In that day men will cast forth
ISA.2.20	their idols of silver and their idols of gold,
ISA.2.20	which they made for themselves to worship,
ISA.2.20	to the moles and to the bats,
ISA.2.21	to enter the caverns of the rocks
ISA.2.21	and the clefts of the cliffs,
ISA.2.21	from before the terror of the 
ISA.2.21	and from the glory of his majesty,
ISA.2.21	when he rises to terrify the earth.
ISA.2.22	Turn away from man
ISA.2.22	in whose nostrils is breath,
ISA.2.22	for of what account is he?
ISA.3.1	For, behold, the Lord, the 
ISA.3.1	is taking away from Jerusalem and from Judah
ISA.3.1	stay and staff,
ISA.3.1	the whole stay of bread,
ISA.3.1	and the whole stay of water;
ISA.3.2	the mighty man and the soldier,
ISA.3.2	the judge and the prophet,
ISA.3.2	the diviner and the elder,
ISA.3.3	the captain of fifty
ISA.3.3	and the man of rank,
ISA.3.3	the counselor and the skilful magician
ISA.3.3	and the expert in charms.
ISA.3.4	And I will make boys their princes,
ISA.3.4	and babes shall rule over them.
ISA.3.5	And the people will oppress one another,
ISA.3.5	every man his fellow
ISA.3.5	and every man his neighbor;
ISA.3.5	the youth will be insolent to the elder,
ISA.3.5	and the base fellow to the honorable.
ISA.3.6	When a man takes hold of his brother
ISA.3.6	in the house of his father, saying:
ISA.3.6	“You have a mantle;
ISA.3.6	you shall be our leader,
ISA.3.6	and this heap of ruins
ISA.3.6	shall be under your rule”;
ISA.3.7	in that day he will speak out, saying:
ISA.3.7	“I will not be a healer;
ISA.3.7	in my house there is neither bread nor mantle;
ISA.3.7	you shall not make me
ISA.3.7	leader of the people.”
ISA.3.8	For Jerusalem has stumbled,
ISA.3.8	and Judah has fallen;
ISA.3.8	because their speech and their deeds are against the 
ISA.3.8	defying his glorious presence.
ISA.3.9	Their partiality witnesses against them;
ISA.3.9	they proclaim their sin like Sodom,
ISA.3.9	they do not hide it.
ISA.3.9	Woe to them!
ISA.3.9	For they have brought evil upon themselves.
ISA.3.10	Tell the righteous that it shall be well with them,
ISA.3.10	for they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.
ISA.3.11	Woe to the wicked! It shall be ill with him,
ISA.3.11	for what his hands have done shall be done to him.
ISA.3.12	My people—children are their oppressors,
ISA.3.12	and women rule over them.
ISA.3.12	O my people, your leaders mislead you,
ISA.3.12	and confuse the course of your paths.
ISA.3.13	The 
ISA.3.13	he stands to judge his people.
ISA.3.14	The 
ISA.3.14	with the elders and princes of his people:
ISA.3.14	“It is you who have devoured the vineyard,
ISA.3.14	the spoil of the poor is in your houses.
ISA.3.15	What do you mean by crushing my people,
ISA.3.15	by grinding the face of the poor?”
ISA.3.15	says the Lord 
ISA.3.16	The 
ISA.3.16	Because the daughters of Zion are haughty
ISA.3.16	and walk with outstretched necks,
ISA.3.16	glancing wantonly with their eyes,
ISA.3.16	mincing along as they go,
ISA.3.16	tinkling with their feet;
ISA.3.17	the Lord will smite with a scab
ISA.3.17	the heads of the daughters of Zion,
ISA.3.17	and the 
ISA.3.18	In that day the Lord will take away the finery of the anklets, the headbands, and the crescents; 
ISA.3.19	the pendants, the bracelets, and the scarfs; 
ISA.3.20	the headdresses, the armlets, the sashes, the perfume boxes, and the amulets; 
ISA.3.21	the signet rings and nose rings; 
ISA.3.22	the festal robes, the mantles, the cloaks, and the handbags; 
ISA.3.23	the garments of gauze, the linen garments, the turbans, and the veils.
ISA.3.24	Instead of perfume there will be rottenness;
ISA.3.24	and instead of a girdle, a rope;
ISA.3.24	and instead of well-set hair, baldness;
ISA.3.24	and instead of a rich robe, a girding of sackcloth;
ISA.3.24	instead of beauty, shame.
ISA.3.25	Your men shall fall by the sword
ISA.3.25	and your mighty men in battle.
ISA.3.26	And her gates shall lament and mourn;
ISA.3.26	ravaged, she shall sit upon the ground.
ISA.4.1	And seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, “We will eat our own bread and wear our own clothes, only let us be called by your name; take away our reproach.”
ISA.4.3	And he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, every one who has been recorded for life in Jerusalem, 
ISA.4.4	when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and cleansed the bloodstains of Jerusalem from its midst by a spirit of judgment and by a spirit of burning. 
ISA.4.5	Then the 
ISA.4.6	It will be for a shade by day from the heat, and for a refuge and a shelter from the storm and rain.
ISA.5.1	a love song concerning his vineyard:
ISA.5.1	My beloved had a vineyard
ISA.5.1	on a very fertile hill.
ISA.5.2	He digged it and cleared it of stones,
ISA.5.2	and planted it with choice vines;
ISA.5.2	he built a watchtower in the midst of it,
ISA.5.2	and hewed out a wine vat in it;
ISA.5.2	and he looked for it to yield grapes,
ISA.5.2	but it yielded wild grapes.
ISA.5.3	And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem
ISA.5.3	and men of Judah,
ISA.5.3	judge, I pray you, between me
ISA.5.3	and my vineyard.
ISA.5.4	What more was there to do for my vineyard,
ISA.5.4	that I have not done in it?
ISA.5.4	When I looked for it to yield grapes,
ISA.5.4	why did it yield wild grapes?
ISA.5.5	And now I will tell you
ISA.5.5	what I will do to my vineyard.
ISA.5.5	I will remove its hedge,
ISA.5.5	and it shall be devoured;
ISA.5.5	I will break down its wall,
ISA.5.5	and it shall be trampled down.
ISA.5.6	I will make it a waste;
ISA.5.6	it shall not be pruned or hoed,
ISA.5.6	and briers and thorns shall grow up;
ISA.5.6	I will also command the clouds
ISA.5.6	that they rain no rain upon it.
ISA.5.7	For the vineyard of the 
ISA.5.7	is the house of Israel,
ISA.5.7	and the men of Judah
ISA.5.7	are his pleasant planting;
ISA.5.7	and he looked for justice,
ISA.5.7	but behold, bloodshed;
ISA.5.7	for righteousness,
ISA.5.7	but behold, a cry!
ISA.5.8	Woe to those who join house to house,
ISA.5.8	who add field to field,
ISA.5.8	until there is no more room,
ISA.5.8	and you are made to dwell alone
ISA.5.8	in the midst of the land.
ISA.5.9	The 
ISA.5.9	“Surely many houses shall be desolate,
ISA.5.9	large and beautiful houses, without inhabitant.
ISA.5.10	For ten acres of vineyard shall yield but one bath,
ISA.5.10	and a homer of seed shall yield but an ephah.”
ISA.5.11	Woe to those who rise early in the morning,
ISA.5.11	that they may run after strong drink,
ISA.5.11	who tarry late into the evening
ISA.5.11	till wine inflames them!
ISA.5.12	They have lyre and harp,
ISA.5.12	timbrel and flute and wine at their feasts;
ISA.5.12	but they do not regard the deeds of the 
ISA.5.12	or see the work of his hands.
ISA.5.13	Therefore my people go into exile
ISA.5.13	for want of knowledge;
ISA.5.13	their honored men are dying of hunger,
ISA.5.13	and their multitude is parched with thirst.
ISA.5.14	Therefore Sheol has enlarged its appetite
ISA.5.14	and opened its mouth beyond measure,
ISA.5.14	and the nobility of Jerusalem
ISA.5.14	her throng and he who exults in her.
ISA.5.15	Man is bowed down, and men are brought low,
ISA.5.15	and the eyes of the haughty are humbled.
ISA.5.16	But the 
ISA.5.16	and the Holy God shows himself holy in righteousness.
ISA.5.17	Then shall the lambs graze as in their pasture,
ISA.5.17	fatlings and kids
ISA.5.18	Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood,
ISA.5.18	who draw sin as with cart ropes,
ISA.5.19	who say: “Let him make haste,
ISA.5.19	let him speed his work
ISA.5.19	that we may see it;
ISA.5.19	let the purpose of the Holy One of Israel draw near,
ISA.5.19	and let it come, that we may know it!”
ISA.5.20	Woe to those who call evil good
ISA.5.20	and good evil,
ISA.5.20	who put darkness for light
ISA.5.20	and light for darkness,
ISA.5.20	who put bitter for sweet
ISA.5.20	and sweet for bitter!
ISA.5.21	Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes,
ISA.5.21	and shrewd in their own sight!
ISA.5.22	Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine,
ISA.5.22	and valiant men in mixing strong drink,
ISA.5.23	who acquit the guilty for a bribe,
ISA.5.23	and deprive the innocent of his right!
ISA.5.24	Therefore, as the tongue of fire devours the stubble,
ISA.5.24	and as dry grass sinks down in the flame,
ISA.5.24	so their root will be as rottenness,
ISA.5.24	and their blossom go up like dust;
ISA.5.24	for they have rejected the law of the 
ISA.5.24	and have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.5.25	Therefore the anger of the 
ISA.5.25	and he stretched out his hand against them and smote them,
ISA.5.25	and the mountains quaked;
ISA.5.25	and their corpses were as refuse
ISA.5.25	in the midst of the streets.
ISA.5.25	For all this his anger is not turned away
ISA.5.25	and his hand is stretched out still.
ISA.5.26	He will raise a signal for a nation afar off,
ISA.5.26	and whistle for it from the ends of the earth;
ISA.5.26	and lo, swiftly, speedily it comes!
ISA.5.27	None is weary, none stumbles,
ISA.5.27	none slumbers or sleeps,
ISA.5.27	not a waistcloth is loose,
ISA.5.27	not a sandal-thong broken;
ISA.5.28	their arrows are sharp,
ISA.5.28	all their bows bent,
ISA.5.28	their horses' hoofs seem like flint,
ISA.5.28	and their wheels like the whirlwind.
ISA.5.29	Their roaring is like a lion,
ISA.5.29	like young lions they roar;
ISA.5.29	they growl and seize their prey,
ISA.5.29	they carry it off, and none can rescue.
ISA.5.30	They will growl over it on that day,
ISA.5.30	like the roaring of the sea.
ISA.5.30	And if one look to the land,
ISA.5.30	behold, darkness and distress;
ISA.5.30	and the light is darkened by its clouds.
ISA.6.1	In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple. 
ISA.6.2	Above him stood the seraphim; each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. 
ISA.6.3	 And one called to another and said:
ISA.6.3	“Holy, holy, holy is the 
ISA.6.3	the whole earth is full of his glory.”
ISA.6.5	And I said: “Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the 
ISA.6.6	Then flew one of the seraphim to me, having in his hand a burning coal which he had taken with tongs from the altar. 
ISA.6.7	And he touched my mouth, and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin forgiven.” 
ISA.6.8	And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” Then I said, “Here am I! Send me.” 
ISA.6.9	 And he said, “Go, and say to this people:
ISA.6.9	“ ‘Hear and hear, but do not understand;
ISA.6.9	see and see, but do not perceive.’
ISA.6.10	Make the heart of this people fat,
ISA.6.10	and their ears heavy,
ISA.6.10	and shut their eyes;
ISA.6.10	lest they see with their eyes,
ISA.6.10	and hear with their ears,
ISA.6.10	and understand with their hearts,
ISA.6.10	and turn and be healed.”
ISA.6.11	Then I said, “How long, O Lord?”
ISA.6.11	And he said:
ISA.6.11	“Until cities lie waste
ISA.6.11	without inhabitant,
ISA.6.11	and houses without men,
ISA.6.11	and the land is utterly desolate,
ISA.6.12	and the 
ISA.6.12	and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.
ISA.6.13	And though a tenth remain in it,
ISA.6.13	it will be burned again,
ISA.6.13	like a terebinth or an oak,
ISA.6.13	whose stump remains standing
ISA.6.13	when it is felled.”
ISA.6.13	The holy seed is its stump.
ISA.7.1	In the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah the king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but they could not conquer it. 
ISA.7.2	When the house of David was told, “Syria is in league with Ephraim,” his heart and the heart of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake before the wind.
ISA.7.3	And the 
ISA.7.4	and say to him, ‘Take heed, be quiet, do not fear, and do not let your heart be faint because of these two smoldering stumps of firebrands, at the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria and the son of Remaliah. 
ISA.7.5	Because Syria, with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has devised evil against you, saying, 
ISA.7.6	“Let us go up against Judah and terrify it, and let us conquer it for ourselves, and set up the son of Tabe-el as king in the midst of it,” 
ISA.7.7	thus says the Lord 
ISA.7.7	It shall not stand,
ISA.7.7	and it shall not come to pass.
ISA.7.8	For the head of Syria is Damascus,
ISA.7.8	and the head of Damascus is Rezin.
ISA.7.8	(Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be broken to pieces so that it will no longer be a people.)
ISA.7.9	And the head of Ephraim is Samaria,
ISA.7.9	and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah.
ISA.7.9	If you will not believe,
ISA.7.9	surely you shall not be established.’ ”
ISA.7.10	Again the 
ISA.7.11	“Ask a sign of the 
ISA.7.12	But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, and I will not put the 
ISA.7.13	And he said, “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also? 
ISA.7.14	 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, a young woman
ISA.7.15	He shall eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good. 
ISA.7.16	For before the child knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land before whose two kings you are in dread will be deserted. 
ISA.7.17	The 
ISA.7.18	In that day the 
ISA.7.19	And they will all come and settle in the steep ravines, and in the clefts of the rocks, and on all the thornbushes, and on all the pastures.
ISA.7.20	In that day the Lord will shave with a razor which is hired beyond the River—with the king of Assyria—the head and the hair of the feet, and it will sweep away the beard also.
ISA.7.21	In that day a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep; 
ISA.7.22	and because of the abundance of milk which they give, he will eat curds; for every one that is left in the land will eat curds and honey.
ISA.7.23	In that day every place where there used to be a thousand vines, worth a thousand shekels of silver, will become briers and thorns. 
ISA.7.24	With bow and arrows men will come there, for all the land will be briers and thorns; 
ISA.7.25	and as for all the hills which used to be hoed with a hoe, you will not come there for fear of briers and thorns; but they will become a place where cattle are let loose and where sheep tread.
ISA.8.1	Then the 
ISA.8.2	And I got reliable witnesses, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah, to attest for me. 
ISA.8.3	And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the 
ISA.8.4	for before the child knows how to cry ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria.”
ISA.8.5	The 
ISA.8.6	“Because this people have refused the waters of Shiloah that flow gently, and melt in fear before
ISA.8.7	therefore, behold, the Lord is bringing up against them the waters of the River, mighty and many, the king of Assyria and all his glory; and it will rise over all its channels and go over all its banks; 
ISA.8.8	and it will sweep on into Judah, it will overflow and pass on, reaching even to the neck; and its outspread wings will fill the breadth of your land, O Immanu-el.”
ISA.8.9	Be broken, you peoples, and be dismayed;
ISA.8.9	give ear, all you far countries;
ISA.8.9	gird yourselves and be dismayed;
ISA.8.9	gird yourselves and be dismayed.
ISA.8.10	Take counsel together, but it will come to naught;
ISA.8.10	speak a word, but it will not stand,
ISA.8.10	for God is with us.
ISA.8.11	For the 
ISA.8.12	 “Do not call conspiracy all that this people call conspiracy, and do not fear what they fear, nor be in dread. 
ISA.8.13	But the 
ISA.8.14	 And he will become a sanctuary, and a stone of offense, and a rock of stumbling to both houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
ISA.8.15	And many shall stumble thereon; they shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and taken.”
ISA.8.16	Bind up the testimony, seal the teaching among my disciples. 
ISA.8.17	 I will wait for the 
ISA.8.18	Behold, I and the children whom the 
ISA.8.19	And when they say to you, “Consult the mediums and the wizards who chirp and mutter,” should not a people consult their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living? 
ISA.8.20	To the teaching and to the testimony! Surely for this word which they speak there is no dawn. 
ISA.8.21	They will pass through the land,
ISA.8.22	and they will look to the earth, but behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish; and they will be thrust into thick darkness.
ISA.9.2	have seen a great light;
ISA.9.2	those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness,
ISA.9.2	on them has light shined.
ISA.9.3	Thou hast multiplied the nation,
ISA.9.3	thou hast increased its joy;
ISA.9.3	they rejoice before thee
ISA.9.3	as with joy at the harvest,
ISA.9.3	as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.
ISA.9.4	For the yoke of his burden,
ISA.9.4	and the staff for his shoulder,
ISA.9.4	the rod of his oppressor,
ISA.9.4	thou hast broken as on the day of Midian.
ISA.9.5	For every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult
ISA.9.5	and every garment rolled in blood
ISA.9.5	will be burned as fuel for the fire.
ISA.9.6	For to us a child is born,
ISA.9.6	to us a son is given;
ISA.9.6	and the government will be upon his shoulder,
ISA.9.6	and his name will be called
ISA.9.6	“Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
ISA.9.6	Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.”
ISA.9.7	Of the increase of his government and of peace
ISA.9.7	there will be no end,
ISA.9.7	upon the throne of David, and over his kingdom,
ISA.9.7	to establish it, and to uphold it
ISA.9.7	with justice and with righteousness
ISA.9.7	from this time forth and for evermore.
ISA.9.7	The zeal of the 
ISA.9.8	The Lord has sent a word against Jacob,
ISA.9.8	and it will light upon Israel;
ISA.9.9	and all the people will know,
ISA.9.9	Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria,
ISA.9.9	who say in pride and in arrogance of heart:
ISA.9.10	“The bricks have fallen,
ISA.9.10	but we will build with dressed stones;
ISA.9.10	the sycamores have been cut down,
ISA.9.10	but we will put cedars in their place.”
ISA.9.11	So the 
ISA.9.11	and stirs up their enemies.
ISA.9.12	The Syrians on the east and the Philistines on the west
ISA.9.12	devour Israel with open mouth.
ISA.9.12	For all this his anger is not turned away
ISA.9.12	and his hand is stretched out still.
ISA.9.13	The people did not turn to him who smote them,
ISA.9.13	nor seek the 
ISA.9.14	So the 
ISA.9.14	palm branch and reed in one day—
ISA.9.15	the elder and honored man is the head,
ISA.9.15	and the prophet who teaches lies is the tail;
ISA.9.16	for those who lead this people lead them astray,
ISA.9.16	and those who are led by them are swallowed up.
ISA.9.17	Therefore the Lord does not rejoice over their young men,
ISA.9.17	and has no compassion on their fatherless and widows;
ISA.9.17	for every one is godless and an evildoer,
ISA.9.17	and every mouth speaks folly.
ISA.9.17	For all this his anger is not turned away
ISA.9.17	and his hand is stretched out still.
ISA.9.18	For wickedness burns like a fire,
ISA.9.18	it consumes briers and thorns;
ISA.9.18	it kindles the thickets of the forest,
ISA.9.18	and they roll upward in a column of smoke.
ISA.9.19	Through the wrath of the 
ISA.9.19	the land is burned,
ISA.9.19	and the people are like fuel for the fire;
ISA.9.19	no man spares his brother.
ISA.9.20	They snatch on the right, but are still hungry,
ISA.9.20	and they devour on the left, but are not satisfied;
ISA.9.20	each devours his neighbor's
ISA.9.21	Manasseh Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh,
ISA.9.21	and together they are against Judah.
ISA.9.21	For all this his anger is not turned away
ISA.9.21	and his hand is stretched out still.
ISA.10.1	Woe to those who decree iniquitous decrees,
ISA.10.1	and the writers who keep writing oppression,
ISA.10.2	to turn aside the needy from justice
ISA.10.2	and to rob the poor of my people of their right,
ISA.10.2	that widows may be their spoil,
ISA.10.2	and that they may make the fatherless their prey!
ISA.10.3	What will you do on the day of punishment,
ISA.10.3	in the storm which will come from afar?
ISA.10.3	To whom will you flee for help,
ISA.10.3	and where will you leave your wealth?
ISA.10.4	Nothing remains but to crouch among the prisoners
ISA.10.4	or fall among the slain.
ISA.10.4	For all this his anger is not turned away
ISA.10.4	and his hand is stretched out still.
ISA.10.5	the staff of my fury!
ISA.10.6	Against a godless nation I send him,
ISA.10.6	and against the people of my wrath I command him,
ISA.10.6	to take spoil and seize plunder,
ISA.10.6	and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.
ISA.10.7	But he does not so intend,
ISA.10.7	and his mind does not so think;
ISA.10.7	but it is in his mind to destroy,
ISA.10.7	and to cut off nations not a few;
ISA.10.8	for he says:
ISA.10.8	“Are not my commanders all kings?
ISA.10.9	Is not Calno like Carchemish?
ISA.10.9	Is not Hamath like Arpad?
ISA.10.9	Is not Samaria like Damascus?
ISA.10.10	As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols
ISA.10.10	whose graven images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria,
ISA.10.11	shall I not do to Jerusalem and her idols
ISA.10.11	as I have done to Samaria and her images?”
ISA.10.12	When the Lord has finished all his work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem he
ISA.10.13	For he says:
ISA.10.13	“By the strength of my hand I have done it,
ISA.10.13	and by my wisdom, for I have understanding;
ISA.10.13	I have removed the boundaries of peoples,
ISA.10.13	and have plundered their treasures;
ISA.10.13	like a bull I have brought down those who sat on thrones.
ISA.10.14	My hand has found like a nest
ISA.10.14	the wealth of the peoples;
ISA.10.14	and as men gather eggs that have been forsaken
ISA.10.14	so I have gathered all the earth;
ISA.10.14	and there was none that moved a wing,
ISA.10.14	or opened the mouth, or chirped.”
ISA.10.15	Shall the axe vaunt itself over him who hews with it,
ISA.10.15	or the saw magnify itself against him who wields it?
ISA.10.15	As if a rod should wield him who lifts it,
ISA.10.15	or as if a staff should lift him who is not wood!
ISA.10.16	Therefore the Lord, the 
ISA.10.16	will send wasting sickness among his stout warriors,
ISA.10.16	and under his glory a burning will be kindled,
ISA.10.16	like the burning of fire.
ISA.10.17	The light of Israel will become a fire,
ISA.10.17	and his Holy One a flame;
ISA.10.17	and it will burn and devour
ISA.10.17	his thorns and briers in one day.
ISA.10.18	The glory of his forest and of his fruitful land
ISA.10.18	the 
ISA.10.18	and it will be as when a sick man wastes away.
ISA.10.19	The remnant of the trees of his forest will be so few
ISA.10.19	that a child can write them down.
ISA.10.20	In that day the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no more lean upon him that smote them, but will lean upon the 
ISA.10.21	A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God. 
ISA.10.22	 For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. Destruction is decreed, overflowing with righteousness. 
ISA.10.23	For the Lord, the 
ISA.10.24	Therefore thus says the Lord, the 
ISA.10.25	For in a very little while my indignation will come to an end, and my anger will be directed to their destruction. 
ISA.10.26	And the 
ISA.10.27	And in that day his burden will depart from your shoulder, and his yoke will be destroyed from your neck.”
ISA.10.27	He has gone up from Rimmon,
ISA.10.28	he has come to Aiath;
ISA.10.28	he has passed through Migron,
ISA.10.28	at Michmash he stores his baggage;
ISA.10.29	they have crossed over the pass,
ISA.10.29	at Geba they lodge for the night;
ISA.10.29	Ramah trembles,
ISA.10.29	Gibe-ah of Saul has fled.
ISA.10.30	Cry aloud, O daughter of Gallim!
ISA.10.30	Hearken, O Laishah!
ISA.10.30	Answer her, O Anathoth!
ISA.10.31	Madmenah is in flight,
ISA.10.31	the inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.
ISA.10.32	This very day he will halt at Nob,
ISA.10.32	he will shake his fist
ISA.10.32	at the mount of the daughter of Zion,
ISA.10.32	the hill of Jerusalem.
ISA.10.33	Behold, the Lord, the 
ISA.10.33	will lop the boughs with terrifying power;
ISA.10.33	the great in height will be hewn down,
ISA.10.33	and the lofty will be brought low.
ISA.10.34	He will cut down the thickets of the forest with an axe,
ISA.10.34	and Lebanon with its majestic trees
ISA.11.1	and a branch shall grow out of his roots.
ISA.11.2	the spirit of wisdom and understanding,
ISA.11.2	the spirit of counsel and might,
ISA.11.2	the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the 
ISA.11.3	And his delight shall be in the fear of the 
ISA.11.3	He shall not judge by what his eyes see,
ISA.11.3	or decide by what his ears hear;
ISA.11.4	but with righteousness he shall judge the poor,
ISA.11.4	and decide with equity for the meek of the earth;
ISA.11.4	and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth,
ISA.11.4	and with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked.
ISA.11.5	and faithfulness the girdle of his loins.
ISA.11.6	and the leopard shall lie down with the kid,
ISA.11.6	and the calf and the lion and the fatling together,
ISA.11.6	and a little child shall lead them.
ISA.11.7	The cow and the bear shall feed;
ISA.11.7	their young shall lie down together;
ISA.11.7	and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
ISA.11.8	The sucking child shall play over the hole of the asp,
ISA.11.8	and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder's den.
ISA.11.9	They shall not hurt or destroy
ISA.11.9	in all my holy mountain;
ISA.11.9	for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the 
ISA.11.9	as the waters cover the sea.
ISA.11.11	In that day the Lord will extend his hand yet a second time to recover the remnant which is left of his people, from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Ethiopia, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the coastlands of the sea.
ISA.11.12	He will raise an ensign for the nations,
ISA.11.12	and will assemble the outcasts of Israel,
ISA.11.12	and gather the dispersed of Judah
ISA.11.12	from the four corners of the earth.
ISA.11.13	The jealousy of Ephraim shall depart,
ISA.11.13	and those who harass Judah shall be cut off;
ISA.11.13	Ephraim shall not be jealous of Judah,
ISA.11.13	and Judah shall not harass Ephraim.
ISA.11.14	But they shall swoop down upon the shoulder of the Philistines in the west,
ISA.11.14	and together they shall plunder the people of the east.
ISA.11.14	They shall put forth their hand against Edom and Moab,
ISA.11.14	and the Ammonites shall obey them.
ISA.11.15	And the 
ISA.11.15	the tongue of the sea of Egypt;
ISA.11.15	and will wave his hand over the River
ISA.11.15	with his scorching wind,
ISA.11.15	and smite it into seven channels
ISA.11.15	that men may cross dryshod.
ISA.11.16	And there will be a highway from Assyria
ISA.11.16	for the remnant which is left of his people,
ISA.11.16	as there was for Israel
ISA.11.16	when they came up from the land of Egypt.
ISA.12.1	You will say in that day:
ISA.12.1	“I will give thanks to thee, O 
ISA.12.1	for though thou wast angry with me,
ISA.12.1	thy anger turned away,
ISA.12.1	and thou didst comfort me.
ISA.12.2	“Behold, God is my salvation;
ISA.12.2	I will trust, and will not be afraid;
ISA.12.2	for the 
ISA.12.2	and he has become my salvation.”
ISA.12.3	With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation. 
ISA.12.4	And you will say in that day:
ISA.12.4	“Give thanks to the 
ISA.12.4	call upon his name;
ISA.12.4	make known his deeds among the nations,
ISA.12.4	proclaim that his name is exalted.
ISA.12.5	“Sing praises to the 
ISA.12.5	let this be known
ISA.12.6	Shout, and sing for joy, O inhabitant of Zion,
ISA.12.6	for great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.”
ISA.13.2	On a bare hill raise a signal,
ISA.13.2	cry aloud to them;
ISA.13.2	wave the hand for them to enter
ISA.13.2	the gates of the nobles.
ISA.13.3	I myself have commanded my consecrated ones,
ISA.13.3	have summoned my mighty men to execute my anger,
ISA.13.3	my proudly exulting ones.
ISA.13.4	Hark, a tumult on the mountains
ISA.13.4	as of a great multitude!
ISA.13.4	Hark, an uproar of kingdoms,
ISA.13.4	of nations gathering together!
ISA.13.4	The 
ISA.13.4	a host for battle.
ISA.13.5	They come from a distant land,
ISA.13.5	from the end of the heavens,
ISA.13.5	the 
ISA.13.5	to destroy the whole earth.
ISA.13.6	Wail, for the day of the 
ISA.13.6	as destruction from the Almighty it will come!
ISA.13.7	Therefore all hands will be feeble,
ISA.13.7	and every man's heart will melt,
ISA.13.8	and they will be dismayed.
ISA.13.8	Pangs and agony will seize them;
ISA.13.8	they will be in anguish like a woman in travail.
ISA.13.8	They will look aghast at one another;
ISA.13.8	their faces will be aflame.
ISA.13.9	Behold, the day of the 
ISA.13.9	cruel, with wrath and fierce anger,
ISA.13.9	to make the earth a desolation
ISA.13.9	and to destroy its sinners from it.
ISA.13.10	will not give their light;
ISA.13.10	the sun will be dark at its rising
ISA.13.10	and the moon will not shed its light.
ISA.13.11	I will punish the world for its evil,
ISA.13.11	and the wicked for their iniquity;
ISA.13.11	I will put an end to the pride of the arrogant,
ISA.13.11	and lay low the haughtiness of the ruthless.
ISA.13.12	I will make men more rare than fine gold,
ISA.13.12	and mankind than the gold of Ophir.
ISA.13.13	Therefore I will make the heavens tremble,
ISA.13.13	and the earth will be shaken out of its place,
ISA.13.13	at the wrath of the 
ISA.13.13	in the day of his fierce anger.
ISA.13.14	And like a hunted gazelle,
ISA.13.14	or like sheep with none to gather them,
ISA.13.14	every man will turn to his own people,
ISA.13.14	and every man will flee to his own land.
ISA.13.15	Whoever is found will be thrust through,
ISA.13.15	and whoever is caught will fall by the sword.
ISA.13.16	Their infants will be dashed in pieces
ISA.13.16	before their eyes;
ISA.13.16	their houses will be plundered
ISA.13.16	and their wives ravished.
ISA.13.17	Behold, I am stirring up the Medes against them,
ISA.13.17	who have no regard for silver
ISA.13.17	and do not delight in gold.
ISA.13.18	Their bows will slaughter the young men;
ISA.13.18	they will have no mercy on the fruit of the womb;
ISA.13.18	their eyes will not pity children.
ISA.13.19	And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms,
ISA.13.19	the splendor and pride of the Chaldeans,
ISA.13.19	will be like Sodom and Gomorrah
ISA.13.19	when God overthrew them.
ISA.13.20	It will never be inhabited
ISA.13.20	or dwelt in for all generations;
ISA.13.20	no Arab will pitch his tent there,
ISA.13.20	no shepherds will make their flocks lie down there.
ISA.13.21	and its houses will be full of howling creatures;
ISA.13.21	there ostriches will dwell,
ISA.13.21	and there satyrs will dance.
ISA.13.22	Hyenas will cry in its towers,
ISA.13.22	and jackals in the pleasant palaces;
ISA.13.22	its time is close at hand
ISA.13.22	and its days will not be prolonged.
ISA.14.1	The 
ISA.14.2	And the peoples will take them and bring them to their place, and the house of Israel will possess them in the 
ISA.14.3	When the 
ISA.14.4	you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon:
ISA.14.4	“How the oppressor has ceased,
ISA.14.4	the insolent fury
ISA.14.5	The 
ISA.14.5	the scepter of rulers,
ISA.14.6	that smote the peoples in wrath
ISA.14.6	with unceasing blows,
ISA.14.6	that ruled the nations in anger
ISA.14.6	with unrelenting persecution.
ISA.14.7	The whole earth is at rest and quiet;
ISA.14.7	they break forth into singing.
ISA.14.8	The cypresses rejoice at you,
ISA.14.8	the cedars of Lebanon, saying,
ISA.14.8	‘Since you were laid low,
ISA.14.8	no hewer comes up against us.’
ISA.14.9	Sheol beneath is stirred up
ISA.14.9	to meet you when you come,
ISA.14.9	it rouses the shades to greet you,
ISA.14.9	all who were leaders of the earth;
ISA.14.9	it raises from their thrones
ISA.14.9	all who were kings of the nations.
ISA.14.10	All of them will speak
ISA.14.10	and say to you:
ISA.14.10	‘You too have become as weak as we!
ISA.14.10	You have become like us!’
ISA.14.11	Your pomp is brought down to Sheol,
ISA.14.11	the sound of your harps;
ISA.14.11	maggots are the bed beneath you,
ISA.14.11	and worms are your covering.
ISA.14.12	“How you are fallen from heaven,
ISA.14.12	O Day Star, son of Dawn!
ISA.14.12	How you are cut down to the ground,
ISA.14.12	you who laid the nations low!
ISA.14.13	You said in your heart,
ISA.14.13	‘I will ascend to heaven;
ISA.14.13	above the stars of God
ISA.14.13	I will set my throne on high;
ISA.14.13	I will sit on the mount of assembly
ISA.14.13	in the far north;
ISA.14.14	I will ascend above the heights of the clouds,
ISA.14.14	I will make myself like the Most High.’
ISA.14.15	But you are brought down to Sheol,
ISA.14.15	to the depths of the Pit.
ISA.14.16	Those who see you will stare at you,
ISA.14.16	and ponder over you:
ISA.14.16	‘Is this the man who made the earth tremble,
ISA.14.16	who shook kingdoms,
ISA.14.17	who made the world like a desert
ISA.14.17	and overthrew its cities,
ISA.14.17	who did not let his prisoners go home?’
ISA.14.18	All the kings of the nations lie in glory,
ISA.14.18	each in his own tomb;
ISA.14.19	but you are cast out, away from your sepulchre,
ISA.14.19	like a loathed untimely birth,
ISA.14.19	clothed with the slain, those pierced by the sword,
ISA.14.19	who go down to the stones of the Pit,
ISA.14.19	like a dead body trodden under foot.
ISA.14.20	You will not be joined with them in burial,
ISA.14.20	because you have destroyed your land,
ISA.14.20	you have slain your people.
ISA.14.20	“May the descendants of evildoers
ISA.14.20	nevermore be named!
ISA.14.21	Prepare slaughter for his sons
ISA.14.21	because of the guilt of their fathers,
ISA.14.21	lest they rise and possess the earth,
ISA.14.21	and fill the face of the world with cities.”
ISA.14.22	“I will rise up against them,” says the 
ISA.14.23	And I will make it a possession of the hedgehog, and pools of water, and I will sweep it with the broom of destruction, says the 
ISA.14.24	The 
ISA.14.24	“As I have planned,
ISA.14.24	so shall it be,
ISA.14.24	and as I have purposed,
ISA.14.24	so shall it stand,
ISA.14.25	that I will break the Assyrian in my land,
ISA.14.25	and upon my mountains trample him under foot;
ISA.14.25	and his yoke shall depart from them,
ISA.14.25	and his burden from their shoulder.”
ISA.14.26	This is the purpose that is purposed
ISA.14.26	concerning the whole earth;
ISA.14.26	and this is the hand that is stretched out
ISA.14.26	over all the nations.
ISA.14.27	For the 
ISA.14.27	and who will annul it?
ISA.14.27	His hand is stretched out,
ISA.14.27	and who will turn it back?
ISA.14.28	In the year that King Ahaz died came this oracle:
ISA.14.29	that the rod which smote you is broken,
ISA.14.29	for from the serpent's root will come forth an adder,
ISA.14.29	and its fruit will be a flying serpent.
ISA.14.30	And the first-born of the poor will feed,
ISA.14.30	and the needy lie down in safety;
ISA.14.30	but I will kill your root with famine,
ISA.14.30	and your remnant I
ISA.14.31	Wail, O gate; cry, O city;
ISA.14.31	melt in fear, O Philistia, all of you!
ISA.14.31	For smoke comes out of the north,
ISA.14.31	and there is no straggler in his ranks.”
ISA.14.32	What will one answer the messengers of the nation?
ISA.14.32	“The 
ISA.14.32	and in her the afflicted of his people find refuge.”
ISA.15.1	Because Ar is laid waste in a night
ISA.15.1	Moab is undone;
ISA.15.1	because Kir is laid waste in a night
ISA.15.1	Moab is undone.
ISA.15.2	The daughter of Dibon
ISA.15.2	to the high places to weep;
ISA.15.2	over Nebo and over Medeba
ISA.15.2	Moab wails.
ISA.15.2	On every head is baldness,
ISA.15.2	every beard is shorn;
ISA.15.3	in the streets they gird on sackcloth;
ISA.15.3	on the housetops and in the squares
ISA.15.3	every one wails and melts in tears.
ISA.15.4	Heshbon and Ele-aleh cry out,
ISA.15.4	their voice is heard as far as Jahaz;
ISA.15.4	therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud;
ISA.15.4	his soul trembles.
ISA.15.5	My heart cries out for Moab;
ISA.15.5	his fugitives flee to Zoar,
ISA.15.5	to Eglath-shelishiyah.
ISA.15.5	For at the ascent of Luhith
ISA.15.5	they go up weeping;
ISA.15.5	on the road to Horonaim
ISA.15.5	they raise a cry of destruction;
ISA.15.6	the waters of Nimrim
ISA.15.6	are a desolation;
ISA.15.6	the grass is withered, the new growth fails,
ISA.15.6	the verdure is no more.
ISA.15.7	Therefore the abundance they have gained
ISA.15.7	and what they have laid up
ISA.15.7	they carry away
ISA.15.7	over the Brook of the Willows.
ISA.15.8	For a cry has gone
ISA.15.8	round the land of Moab;
ISA.15.8	the wailing reaches to Eglaim,
ISA.15.8	the wailing reaches to Beer-elim.
ISA.15.9	For the waters of Dibon
ISA.15.9	yet I will bring upon Dibon
ISA.15.9	a lion for those of Moab who escape,
ISA.15.9	for the remnant of the land.
ISA.16.1	They have sent lambs
ISA.16.1	to the ruler of the land,
ISA.16.1	from Sela, by way of the desert,
ISA.16.1	to the mount of the daughter of Zion.
ISA.16.2	Like fluttering birds,
ISA.16.2	like scattered nestlings,
ISA.16.2	so are the daughters of Moab
ISA.16.2	at the fords of the Arnon.
ISA.16.3	“Give counsel,
ISA.16.3	grant justice;
ISA.16.3	make your shade like night
ISA.16.3	at the height of noon;
ISA.16.3	hide the outcasts,
ISA.16.3	betray not the fugitive;
ISA.16.4	let the outcasts of Moab
ISA.16.4	sojourn among you;
ISA.16.4	be a refuge to them
ISA.16.4	from the destroyer.
ISA.16.4	When the oppressor is no more,
ISA.16.4	and destruction has ceased,
ISA.16.4	and he who tramples under foot
ISA.16.4	has vanished from the land,
ISA.16.5	then a throne will be established in steadfast love
ISA.16.5	and on it will sit in faithfulness
ISA.16.5	in the tent of David
ISA.16.5	one who judges and seeks justice
ISA.16.5	and is swift to do righteousness.”
ISA.16.6	We have heard of the pride of Moab,
ISA.16.6	how proud he was;
ISA.16.6	of his arrogance, his pride, and his insolence—
ISA.16.6	his boasts are false.
ISA.16.7	Therefore let Moab wail,
ISA.16.7	let every one wail for Moab.
ISA.16.7	Mourn, utterly stricken,
ISA.16.7	for the raisin-cakes of Kir-hareseth.
ISA.16.8	For the fields of Heshbon languish,
ISA.16.8	and the vine of Sibmah;
ISA.16.8	the lords of the nations
ISA.16.8	have struck down its branches,
ISA.16.8	which reached to Jazer
ISA.16.8	and strayed to the desert;
ISA.16.8	its shoots spread abroad
ISA.16.8	and passed over the sea.
ISA.16.9	Therefore I weep with the weeping of Jazer
ISA.16.9	for the vine of Sibmah;
ISA.16.9	I drench you with my tears,
ISA.16.9	O Heshbon and Ele-aleh;
ISA.16.9	for upon your fruit and your harvest
ISA.16.9	the battle shout has fallen.
ISA.16.10	And joy and gladness are taken away
ISA.16.10	from the fruitful field;
ISA.16.10	and in the vineyards no songs are sung,
ISA.16.10	no shouts are raised;
ISA.16.10	no treader treads out wine in the presses;
ISA.16.10	the vintage shout is hushed.
ISA.16.11	Therefore my soul moans like a lyre for Moab,
ISA.16.11	and my heart for Kir-heres.
ISA.16.12	And when Moab presents himself, when he wearies himself upon the high place, when he comes to his sanctuary to pray, he will not prevail.
ISA.16.13	This is the word which the 
ISA.16.14	But now the 
ISA.17.1	Behold, Damascus will cease to be a city,
ISA.17.1	and will become a heap of ruins.
ISA.17.2	Her cities will be deserted for ever;
ISA.17.2	they will be for flocks,
ISA.17.2	which will lie down, and none will make them afraid.
ISA.17.3	The fortress will disappear from Ephraim,
ISA.17.3	and the kingdom from Damascus;
ISA.17.3	and the remnant of Syria will be
ISA.17.3	like the glory of the children of Israel,
ISA.17.3	says the 
ISA.17.4	And in that day
ISA.17.4	the glory of Jacob will be brought low,
ISA.17.4	and the fat of his flesh will grow lean.
ISA.17.5	And it shall be as when the reaper gathers standing grain
ISA.17.5	and his arm harvests the ears,
ISA.17.5	and as when one gleans the ears of grain
ISA.17.5	in the Valley of Rephaim.
ISA.17.6	Gleanings will be left in it,
ISA.17.6	as when an olive tree is beaten—
ISA.17.6	two or three berries
ISA.17.6	in the top of the highest bough,
ISA.17.6	four or five
ISA.17.6	on the branches of a fruit tree,
ISA.17.6	says the 
ISA.17.7	In that day men will regard their Maker, and their eyes will look to the Holy One of Israel; 
ISA.17.8	they will not have regard for the altars, the work of their hands, and they will not look to what their own fingers have made, either the Asherim or the altars of incense.
ISA.17.9	In that day their strong cities will be like the deserted places of the Hivites and the Amorites,
ISA.17.10	For you have forgotten the God of your salvation,
ISA.17.10	and have not remembered the Rock of your refuge;
ISA.17.10	therefore, though you plant pleasant plants
ISA.17.10	and set out slips of an alien god,
ISA.17.11	though you make them grow on the day that you plant them,
ISA.17.11	and make them blossom in the morning that you sow;
ISA.17.11	yet the harvest will flee away
ISA.17.11	in a day of grief and incurable pain.
ISA.17.12	Ah, the thunder of many peoples,
ISA.17.12	they thunder like the thundering of the sea!
ISA.17.12	Ah, the roar of nations,
ISA.17.12	they roar like the roaring of mighty waters!
ISA.17.13	The nations roar like the roaring of many waters,
ISA.17.13	but he will rebuke them, and they will flee far away,
ISA.17.13	chased like chaff on the mountains before the wind
ISA.17.13	and whirling dust before the storm.
ISA.17.14	At evening time, behold, terror!
ISA.17.14	Before morning, they are no more!
ISA.17.14	This is the portion of those who despoil us,
ISA.17.14	and the lot of those who plunder us.
ISA.18.1	which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia;
ISA.18.2	which sends ambassadors by the Nile,
ISA.18.2	in vessels of papyrus upon the waters!
ISA.18.2	Go, you swift messengers,
ISA.18.2	to a nation, tall and smooth,
ISA.18.2	to a people feared near and far,
ISA.18.2	a nation mighty and conquering,
ISA.18.2	whose land the rivers divide.
ISA.18.3	All you inhabitants of the world,
ISA.18.3	you who dwell on the earth,
ISA.18.3	when a signal is raised on the mountains, look!
ISA.18.3	When a trumpet is blown, hear!
ISA.18.4	For thus the 
ISA.18.4	“I will quietly look from my dwelling
ISA.18.4	like clear heat in sunshine,
ISA.18.4	like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.”
ISA.18.5	For before the harvest, when the blossom is over,
ISA.18.5	and the flower becomes a ripening grape,
ISA.18.5	he will cut off the shoots with pruning hooks,
ISA.18.5	and the spreading branches he will hew away.
ISA.18.6	They shall all of them be left
ISA.18.6	to the birds of prey of the mountains
ISA.18.6	and to the beasts of the earth.
ISA.18.6	And the birds of prey will summer upon them,
ISA.18.6	and all the beasts of the earth will winter upon them.
ISA.18.7	At that time gifts will be brought to the 
ISA.18.7	from a people tall and smooth,
ISA.18.7	from a people feared near and far,
ISA.18.7	a nation mighty and conquering,
ISA.18.7	whose land the rivers divide,
ISA.18.7	to Mount Zion, the place of the name of the 
ISA.19.1	Behold, the 
ISA.19.1	and comes to Egypt;
ISA.19.1	and the idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence,
ISA.19.1	and the heart of the Egyptians will melt within them.
ISA.19.2	And I will stir up Egyptians against Egyptians,
ISA.19.2	and they will fight, every man against his brother
ISA.19.2	and every man against his neighbor,
ISA.19.2	city against city, kingdom against kingdom;
ISA.19.3	and the spirit of the Egyptians within them will be emptied out,
ISA.19.3	and I will confound their plans;
ISA.19.3	and they will consult the idols and the sorcerers,
ISA.19.3	and the mediums and the wizards;
ISA.19.4	and I will give over the Egyptians
ISA.19.4	into the hand of a hard master;
ISA.19.4	and a fierce king will rule over them,
ISA.19.4	says the Lord, the 
ISA.19.5	And the waters of the Nile will be dried up,
ISA.19.5	and the river will be parched and dry;
ISA.19.6	and its canals will become foul,
ISA.19.6	and the branches of Egypt's Nile will diminish and dry up,
ISA.19.6	reeds and rushes will rot away.
ISA.19.7	There will be bare places by the Nile,
ISA.19.7	on the brink of the Nile,
ISA.19.7	and all that is sown by the Nile will dry up,
ISA.19.7	be driven away, and be no more.
ISA.19.8	The fishermen will mourn and lament,
ISA.19.8	all who cast hook in the Nile;
ISA.19.8	and they will languish
ISA.19.8	who spread nets upon the water.
ISA.19.9	The workers in combed flax will be in despair,
ISA.19.9	and the weavers of white cotton.
ISA.19.10	Those who are the pillars of the land will be crushed,
ISA.19.10	and all who work for hire will be grieved.
ISA.19.11	The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish;
ISA.19.11	the wise counselors of Pharaoh give stupid counsel.
ISA.19.11	How can you say to Pharaoh,
ISA.19.11	“I am a son of the wise,
ISA.19.11	a son of ancient kings”?
ISA.19.12	Where then are your wise men?
ISA.19.12	Let them tell you and make known
ISA.19.12	what the 
ISA.19.13	The princes of Zoan have become fools,
ISA.19.13	and the princes of Memphis are deluded;
ISA.19.13	those who are the cornerstones of her tribes
ISA.19.13	have led Egypt astray.
ISA.19.14	The 
ISA.19.14	a spirit of confusion;
ISA.19.14	and they have made Egypt stagger in all her doings
ISA.19.14	as a drunken man staggers in his vomit.
ISA.19.15	And there will be nothing for Egypt
ISA.19.15	which head or tail, palm branch or reed, may do.
ISA.19.16	In that day the Egyptians will be like women, and tremble with fear before the hand which the 
ISA.19.17	And the land of Judah will become a terror to the Egyptians; every one to whom it is mentioned will fear because of the purpose which the 
ISA.19.18	In that day there will be five cities in the land of Egypt which speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the 
ISA.19.19	In that day there will be an altar to the 
ISA.19.20	It will be a sign and a witness to the 
ISA.19.21	And the 
ISA.19.22	And the 
ISA.19.23	In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian will come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.
ISA.19.24	In that day Israel will be the third with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth, 
ISA.19.25	whom the 
ISA.20.1	In the year that the commander in chief, who was sent by Sargon the king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and fought against it and took it,— 
ISA.20.2	at that time the 
ISA.20.3	the 
ISA.20.4	so shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians captives and the Ethiopians exiles, both the young and the old, naked and barefoot, with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt. 
ISA.20.5	Then they shall be dismayed and confounded because of Ethiopia their hope and of Egypt their boast. 
ISA.20.6	And the inhabitants of this coastland will say in that day, ‘Behold, this is what has happened to those in whom we hoped and to whom we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria! And we, how shall we escape?’ ”
ISA.21.1	The oracle concerning the wilderness of the sea.
ISA.21.1	As whirlwinds in the Negeb sweep on,
ISA.21.1	it comes from the desert,
ISA.21.1	from a terrible land.
ISA.21.2	A stern vision is told to me;
ISA.21.2	the plunderer plunders,
ISA.21.2	and the destroyer destroys.
ISA.21.2	Go up, O Elam,
ISA.21.2	lay siege, O Media;
ISA.21.2	all the sighing she has caused
ISA.21.2	I bring to an end.
ISA.21.3	Therefore my loins are filled with anguish;
ISA.21.3	pangs have seized me,
ISA.21.3	like the pangs of a woman in travail;
ISA.21.3	I am bowed down so that I cannot hear,
ISA.21.3	I am dismayed so that I cannot see.
ISA.21.4	My mind reels, horror has appalled me;
ISA.21.4	the twilight I longed for
ISA.21.4	has been turned for me into trembling.
ISA.21.5	They prepare the table,
ISA.21.5	they spread the rugs,
ISA.21.5	they eat, they drink.
ISA.21.5	Arise, O princes,
ISA.21.5	oil the shield!
ISA.21.6	For thus the Lord said to me:
ISA.21.6	“Go, set a watchman,
ISA.21.6	let him announce what he sees.
ISA.21.7	When he sees riders, horsemen in pairs,
ISA.21.7	riders on asses, riders on camels,
ISA.21.7	let him listen diligently,
ISA.21.7	very diligently.”
ISA.21.8	Then he who saw
ISA.21.8	“Upon a watchtower I stand, O Lord,
ISA.21.8	continually by day,
ISA.21.8	and at my post I am stationed
ISA.21.8	whole nights.
ISA.21.9	And behold, here come riders,
ISA.21.9	horsemen in pairs!”
ISA.21.9	And he answered,
ISA.21.9	“Fallen, fallen is Babylon;
ISA.21.9	and all the images of her gods
ISA.21.9	he has shattered to the ground.”
ISA.21.10	O my threshed and winnowed one,
ISA.21.10	what I have heard from the 
ISA.21.10	the God of Israel, I announce to you.
ISA.21.11	The oracle concerning Dumah.
ISA.21.11	One is calling to me from Seir,
ISA.21.11	“Watchman, what of the night?
ISA.21.11	Watchman, what of the night?”
ISA.21.12	The watchman says:
ISA.21.12	“Morning comes, and also the night.
ISA.21.12	If you will inquire, inquire;
ISA.21.12	come back again.”
ISA.21.13	The oracle concerning Arabia.
ISA.21.13	In the thickets in Arabia you will lodge,
ISA.21.13	O caravans of Dedanites.
ISA.21.14	To the thirsty bring water,
ISA.21.14	meet the fugitive with bread,
ISA.21.14	O inhabitants of the land of Tema.
ISA.21.15	For they have fled from the swords,
ISA.21.15	from the drawn sword,
ISA.21.15	from the bent bow,
ISA.21.15	and from the press of battle.
ISA.21.16	For thus the Lord said to me, “Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, all the glory of Kedar will come to an end; 
ISA.21.17	and the remainder of the archers of the mighty men of the sons of Kedar will be few; for the 
ISA.22.1	The oracle concerning the valley of vision.
ISA.22.1	What do you mean that you have gone up,
ISA.22.1	all of you, to the housetops,
ISA.22.2	you who are full of shoutings,
ISA.22.2	tumultuous city, exultant town?
ISA.22.2	Your slain are not slain with the sword
ISA.22.2	or dead in battle.
ISA.22.3	All your rulers have fled together,
ISA.22.3	without the bow they were captured.
ISA.22.3	All of you who were found were captured,
ISA.22.3	though they had fled far away.
ISA.22.4	Therefore I said:
ISA.22.4	“Look away from me,
ISA.22.4	let me weep bitter tears;
ISA.22.4	do not labor to comfort me
ISA.22.4	for the destruction of the daughter of my people.”
ISA.22.5	For the Lord 
ISA.22.5	of tumult and trampling and confusion
ISA.22.5	in the valley of vision,
ISA.22.5	a battering down of walls
ISA.22.5	and a shouting to the mountains.
ISA.22.6	And Elam bore the quiver
ISA.22.6	with chariots and horsemen,
ISA.22.6	and Kir uncovered the shield.
ISA.22.7	Your choicest valleys were full of chariots,
ISA.22.7	and the horsemen took their stand at the gates.
ISA.22.8	He has taken away the covering of Judah.
ISA.22.8	In that day you looked to the weapons of the House of the Forest, 
ISA.22.9	and you saw that the breaches of the city of David were many, and you collected the waters of the lower pool, 
ISA.22.10	and you counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall. 
ISA.22.11	You made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you did not look to him who did it, or have regard for him who planned it long ago.
ISA.22.12	In that day the Lord 
ISA.22.12	called to weeping and mourning,
ISA.22.12	to baldness and girding with sackcloth;
ISA.22.13	and behold, joy and gladness,
ISA.22.13	slaying oxen and killing sheep,
ISA.22.13	eating flesh and drinking wine.
ISA.22.13	“Let us eat and drink,
ISA.22.13	for tomorrow we die.”
ISA.22.14	The 
ISA.22.14	“Surely this iniquity will not be forgiven you
ISA.22.14	till you die,”
ISA.22.14	says the Lord 
ISA.22.15	Thus says the Lord 
ISA.22.16	What have you to do here and whom have you here, that you have hewn here a tomb for yourself, you who hew a tomb on the height, and carve a habitation for yourself in the rock? 
ISA.22.17	Behold, the 
ISA.22.18	and whirl you round and round, and throw you like a ball into a wide land; there you shall die, and there shall be your splendid chariots, you shame of your master's house. 
ISA.22.19	I will thrust you from your office, and you will be cast down from your station. 
ISA.22.20	In that day I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, 
ISA.22.21	and I will clothe him with your robe, and will bind your girdle on him, and will commit your authority to his hand; and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. 
ISA.22.22	 And I will place on his shoulder the key of the house of David; he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open. 
ISA.22.23	And I will fasten him like a peg in a sure place, and he will become a throne of honor to his father's house. 
ISA.22.24	And they will hang on him the whole weight of his father's house, the offspring and issue, every small vessel, from the cups to all the flagons. 
ISA.22.25	In that day, says the 
ISA.23.1	Wail, O ships of Tarshish,
ISA.23.1	for Tyre is laid waste, without house or haven!
ISA.23.1	From the land of Cyprus
ISA.23.1	it is revealed to them.
ISA.23.2	Be still, O inhabitants of the coast,
ISA.23.2	O merchants of Sidon;
ISA.23.2	your messengers passed over the sea
ISA.23.3	and were on many waters;
ISA.23.3	your revenue was the grain of Shihor,
ISA.23.3	the harvest of the Nile;
ISA.23.3	you were the merchant of the nations.
ISA.23.4	Be ashamed, O Sidon, for the sea has spoken,
ISA.23.4	the stronghold of the sea, saying:
ISA.23.4	“I have neither travailed nor given birth,
ISA.23.4	I have neither reared young men
ISA.23.4	nor brought up virgins.”
ISA.23.5	When the report comes to Egypt,
ISA.23.5	they will be in anguish over the report about Tyre.
ISA.23.6	Pass over to Tarshish,
ISA.23.6	wail, O inhabitants of the coast!
ISA.23.7	Is this your exultant city
ISA.23.7	whose origin is from days of old,
ISA.23.7	whose feet carried her
ISA.23.7	to settle afar?
ISA.23.8	Who has purposed this
ISA.23.8	against Tyre, the bestower of crowns,
ISA.23.8	whose merchants were princes,
ISA.23.8	whose traders were the honored of the earth?
ISA.23.9	The 
ISA.23.9	to defile the pride of all glory,
ISA.23.9	to dishonor all the honored of the earth.
ISA.23.10	Overflow your land like the Nile,
ISA.23.10	O daughter of Tarshish;
ISA.23.10	there is no restraint any more.
ISA.23.11	He has stretched out his hand over the sea,
ISA.23.11	he has shaken the kingdoms;
ISA.23.11	the 
ISA.23.11	to destroy its strongholds.
ISA.23.12	And he said:
ISA.23.12	“You will no more exult,
ISA.23.12	O oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon;
ISA.23.12	arise, pass over to Cyprus,
ISA.23.12	even there you will have no rest.”
ISA.23.13	Behold the land of the Chaldeans! This is the people; it was not Assyria. They destined Tyre for wild beasts. They erected their siege towers, they razed her palaces, they made her a ruin.
ISA.23.14	Wail, O ships of Tarshish,
ISA.23.14	for your stronghold is laid waste.
ISA.23.15	In that day Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, like the days of one king. At the end of seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the harlot:
ISA.23.16	“Take a harp,
ISA.23.16	go about the city,
ISA.23.16	O forgotten harlot!
ISA.23.16	Make sweet melody,
ISA.23.16	sing many songs,
ISA.23.16	that you may be remembered.”
ISA.23.18	Her merchandise and her hire will be dedicated to the 
ISA.24.1	Behold, the 
ISA.24.1	and he will twist its surface and scatter its inhabitants.
ISA.24.2	And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest;
ISA.24.2	as with the slave, so with his master;
ISA.24.2	as with the maid, so with her mistress;
ISA.24.2	as with the buyer, so with the seller;
ISA.24.2	as with the lender, so with the borrower;
ISA.24.2	as with the creditor, so with the debtor.
ISA.24.3	The earth shall be utterly laid waste and utterly despoiled;
ISA.24.3	for the 
ISA.24.4	The earth mourns and withers,
ISA.24.4	the world languishes and withers;
ISA.24.4	the heavens languish together with the earth.
ISA.24.5	The earth lies polluted
ISA.24.5	under its inhabitants;
ISA.24.5	for they have transgressed the laws,
ISA.24.5	violated the statutes,
ISA.24.5	broken the everlasting covenant.
ISA.24.6	Therefore a curse devours the earth,
ISA.24.6	and its inhabitants suffer for their guilt;
ISA.24.6	therefore the inhabitants of the earth are scorched,
ISA.24.6	and few men are left.
ISA.24.7	The wine mourns,
ISA.24.7	the vine languishes,
ISA.24.7	all the merry-hearted sigh.
ISA.24.8	the noise of the jubilant has ceased,
ISA.24.8	the mirth of the lyre is stilled.
ISA.24.9	No more do they drink wine with singing;
ISA.24.9	strong drink is bitter to those who drink it.
ISA.24.10	The city of chaos is broken down,
ISA.24.10	every house is shut up so that none can enter.
ISA.24.11	There is an outcry in the streets for lack of wine;
ISA.24.11	all joy has reached its eventide;
ISA.24.11	the gladness of the earth is banished.
ISA.24.12	Desolation is left in the city,
ISA.24.12	the gates are battered into ruins.
ISA.24.13	For thus it shall be in the midst of the earth
ISA.24.13	among the nations,
ISA.24.13	as when an olive tree is beaten,
ISA.24.13	as at the gleaning when the vintage is done.
ISA.24.14	They lift up their voices, they sing for joy;
ISA.24.14	over the majesty of the 
ISA.24.15	Therefore in the east give glory to the 
ISA.24.15	in the coastlands of the sea, to the name of the 
ISA.24.16	From the ends of the earth we hear songs of praise,
ISA.24.16	of glory to the Righteous One.
ISA.24.16	But I say, “I pine away,
ISA.24.16	I pine away. Woe is me!
ISA.24.16	For the treacherous deal treacherously,
ISA.24.16	the treacherous deal very treacherously.”
ISA.24.17	Terror, and the pit, and the snare
ISA.24.17	are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth!
ISA.24.18	He who flees at the sound of the terror
ISA.24.18	shall fall into the pit;
ISA.24.18	and he who climbs out of the pit
ISA.24.18	shall be caught in the snare.
ISA.24.18	For the windows of heaven are opened,
ISA.24.18	and the foundations of the earth tremble.
ISA.24.19	The earth is utterly broken,
ISA.24.19	the earth is rent asunder,
ISA.24.19	the earth is violently shaken.
ISA.24.20	The earth staggers like a drunken man,
ISA.24.20	it sways like a hut;
ISA.24.20	its transgression lies heavy upon it,
ISA.24.20	and it falls, and will not rise again.
ISA.24.21	On that day the 
ISA.24.21	the host of heaven, in heaven,
ISA.24.21	and the kings of the earth, on the earth.
ISA.24.22	They will be gathered together
ISA.24.22	as prisoners in a pit;
ISA.24.22	they will be shut up in a prison,
ISA.24.22	and after many days they will be punished.
ISA.24.23	Then the moon will be confounded,
ISA.24.23	and the sun ashamed;
ISA.24.23	for the 
ISA.24.23	on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem
ISA.24.23	and before his elders he will manifest his glory.
ISA.25.1	O 
ISA.25.1	I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name;
ISA.25.1	for thou hast done wonderful things,
ISA.25.1	plans formed of old, faithful and sure.
ISA.25.2	For thou hast made the city a heap,
ISA.25.2	the fortified city a ruin;
ISA.25.2	the palace of aliens is a city no more,
ISA.25.2	it will never be rebuilt.
ISA.25.3	Therefore strong peoples will glorify thee;
ISA.25.3	cities of ruthless nations will fear thee.
ISA.25.4	For thou hast been a stronghold to the poor,
ISA.25.4	a stronghold to the needy in his distress,
ISA.25.4	a shelter from the storm and a shade from the heat;
ISA.25.4	for the blast of the ruthless is like a storm against a wall,
ISA.25.5	like heat in a dry place.
ISA.25.5	Thou dost subdue the noise of the aliens;
ISA.25.5	as heat by the shade of a cloud,
ISA.25.5	so the song of the ruthless is stilled.
ISA.25.6	On this mountain the 
ISA.25.7	And he will destroy on this mountain the covering that is cast over all peoples, the veil that is spread over all nations. 
ISA.25.8	 He will swallow up death for ever, and the Lord 
ISA.25.9	It will be said on that day, “Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, that he might save us. This is the 
ISA.25.11	And he will spread out his hands in the midst of it as a swimmer spreads his hands out to swim; but the 
ISA.25.12	And the high fortifications of his walls he will bring down, lay low, and cast to the ground, even to the dust.
ISA.26.1	In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah:
ISA.26.1	“We have a strong city;
ISA.26.1	he sets up salvation
ISA.26.1	as walls and bulwarks.
ISA.26.2	Open the gates,
ISA.26.2	that the righteous nation which keeps faith
ISA.26.2	may enter in.
ISA.26.3	Thou dost keep him in perfect peace,
ISA.26.3	whose mind is stayed on thee,
ISA.26.3	because he trusts in thee.
ISA.26.4	Trust in the 
ISA.26.4	for the 
ISA.26.4	is an everlasting rock.
ISA.26.5	For he has brought low
ISA.26.5	the inhabitants of the height,
ISA.26.5	the lofty city.
ISA.26.5	He lays it low, lays it low to the ground,
ISA.26.5	casts it to the dust.
ISA.26.6	The foot tramples it,
ISA.26.6	the feet of the poor,
ISA.26.6	the steps of the needy.”
ISA.26.7	The way of the righteous is level;
ISA.26.7	thou
ISA.26.8	In the path of thy judgments,
ISA.26.8	O 
ISA.26.8	thy memorial name
ISA.26.8	is the desire of our soul.
ISA.26.9	My soul yearns for thee in the night,
ISA.26.9	my spirit within me earnestly seeks thee.
ISA.26.9	For when thy judgments are in the earth,
ISA.26.9	the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.
ISA.26.10	If favor is shown to the wicked,
ISA.26.10	he does not learn righteousness;
ISA.26.10	in the land of uprightness he deals perversely
ISA.26.10	and does not see the majesty of the 
ISA.26.11	O 
ISA.26.11	but they see it not.
ISA.26.11	Let them see thy zeal for thy people, and be ashamed.
ISA.26.11	Let the fire for thy adversaries consume them.
ISA.26.12	O 
ISA.26.12	thou hast wrought for us all our works.
ISA.26.13	O 
ISA.26.13	other lords besides thee have ruled over us,
ISA.26.13	but thy name alone we acknowledge.
ISA.26.14	They are dead, they will not live;
ISA.26.14	they are shades, they will not arise;
ISA.26.14	to that end thou hast visited them with destruction
ISA.26.14	and wiped out all remembrance of them.
ISA.26.15	But thou hast increased the nation, O 
ISA.26.15	thou hast increased the nation; thou art glorified;
ISA.26.15	thou hast enlarged all the borders of the land.
ISA.26.16	O 
ISA.26.16	they poured out a prayer
ISA.26.16	when thy chastening was upon them.
ISA.26.17	Like a woman with child,
ISA.26.17	who writhes and cries out in her pangs,
ISA.26.17	when she is near her time,
ISA.26.17	so were we because of thee, O 
ISA.26.18	we were with child, we writhed,
ISA.26.18	we have as it were brought forth wind.
ISA.26.18	We have wrought no deliverance in the earth,
ISA.26.18	and the inhabitants of the world have not fallen.
ISA.26.19	Thy dead shall live, their bodies
ISA.26.19	O dwellers in the dust, awake and sing for joy!
ISA.26.19	For thy dew is a dew of light,
ISA.26.19	and on the land of the shades thou wilt let it fall.
ISA.26.20	Come, my people, enter your chambers,
ISA.26.20	and shut your doors behind you;
ISA.26.20	hide yourselves for a little while
ISA.26.20	until the wrath is past.
ISA.26.21	For behold, the 
ISA.26.21	to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity,
ISA.26.21	and the earth will disclose the blood shed upon her,
ISA.26.21	and will no more cover her slain.
ISA.27.1	In that day the 
ISA.27.2	In that day:
ISA.27.2	“A pleasant vineyard, sing of it!
ISA.27.3	I, the 
ISA.27.3	every moment I water it.
ISA.27.3	Lest any one harm it,
ISA.27.3	I guard it night and day;
ISA.27.4	I have no wrath.
ISA.27.4	Would that I had thorns and briers to battle!
ISA.27.4	I would set out against them,
ISA.27.4	I would burn them up together.
ISA.27.5	Or let them lay hold of my protection,
ISA.27.5	let them make peace with me,
ISA.27.5	let them make peace with me.”
ISA.27.6	In days to come
ISA.27.6	Israel shall blossom and put forth shoots,
ISA.27.6	and fill the whole world with fruit.
ISA.27.7	Has he smitten them as he smote those who smote them?
ISA.27.7	Or have they been slain as their slayers were slain?
ISA.27.8	Measure by measure,
ISA.27.8	he removed them with his fierce blast in the day of the east wind.
ISA.27.9	Therefore by this the guilt of Jacob will be expiated,
ISA.27.9	and this will be the full fruit of the removal of his sin:
ISA.27.9	when he makes all the stones of the altars
ISA.27.9	like chalkstones crushed to pieces,
ISA.27.9	no Asherim or incense altars will remain standing.
ISA.27.10	For the fortified city is solitary,
ISA.27.10	a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness;
ISA.27.10	there the calf grazes,
ISA.27.10	there he lies down, and strips its branches.
ISA.27.11	When its boughs are dry, they are broken;
ISA.27.11	women come and make a fire of them.
ISA.27.11	For this is a people without discernment;
ISA.27.11	therefore he who made them will not have compassion on them,
ISA.27.11	he that formed them will show them no favor.
ISA.27.12	In that day from the river Euphrates to the Brook of Egypt the 
ISA.27.13	 And in that day a great trumpet will be blown, and those who were lost in the land of Assyria and those who were driven out to the land of Egypt will come and worship the 
ISA.28.1	Woe to the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim,
ISA.28.1	and to the fading flower of its glorious beauty,
ISA.28.1	which is on the head of the rich valley of those overcome with wine!
ISA.28.2	Behold, the Lord has one who is mighty and strong;
ISA.28.2	like a storm of hail, a destroying tempest,
ISA.28.2	like a storm of mighty, overflowing waters,
ISA.28.2	he will cast down to the earth with violence.
ISA.28.3	The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim
ISA.28.3	will be trodden under foot;
ISA.28.4	and the fading flower of its glorious beauty,
ISA.28.4	which is on the head of the rich valley,
ISA.28.4	will be like a first-ripe fig before the summer:
ISA.28.4	when a man sees it, he eats it up
ISA.28.4	as soon as it is in his hand.
ISA.28.5	In that day the 
ISA.28.5	and a diadem of beauty, to the remnant of his people;
ISA.28.6	and a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment,
ISA.28.6	and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.
ISA.28.7	These also reel with wine
ISA.28.7	and stagger with strong drink;
ISA.28.7	the priest and the prophet reel with strong drink,
ISA.28.7	they are confused with wine,
ISA.28.7	they stagger with strong drink;
ISA.28.7	they err in vision,
ISA.28.7	they stumble in giving judgment.
ISA.28.8	For all tables are full of vomit,
ISA.28.8	no place is without filthiness.
ISA.28.9	“Whom will he teach knowledge,
ISA.28.9	and to whom will he explain the message?
ISA.28.9	Those who are weaned from the milk,
ISA.28.9	those taken from the breast?
ISA.28.10	For it is precept upon precept, precept upon precept,
ISA.28.10	line upon line, line upon line,
ISA.28.10	here a little, there a little.”
ISA.28.11	and with an alien tongue
ISA.28.11	the 
ISA.28.12	“This is rest;
ISA.28.12	give rest to the weary;
ISA.28.12	and this is repose”;
ISA.28.12	yet they would not hear.
ISA.28.13	Therefore the word of the 
ISA.28.13	precept upon precept, precept upon precept,
ISA.28.13	line upon line, line upon line,
ISA.28.13	here a little, there a little;
ISA.28.13	that they may go, and fall backward,
ISA.28.13	and be broken, and snared, and taken.
ISA.28.14	Therefore hear the word of the 
ISA.28.14	who rule this people in Jerusalem!
ISA.28.15	Because you have said, “We have made a covenant with death,
ISA.28.15	and with Sheol we have an agreement;
ISA.28.15	when the overwhelming scourge passes through
ISA.28.15	it will not come to us;
ISA.28.15	for we have made lies our refuge,
ISA.28.15	and in falsehood we have taken shelter”;
ISA.28.16	“Behold, I am laying in Zion for a foundation
ISA.28.16	a stone, a tested stone,
ISA.28.16	a precious cornerstone, of a sure foundation:
ISA.28.16	‘He who believes will not be in haste.’
ISA.28.17	And I will make justice the line,
ISA.28.17	and righteousness the plummet;
ISA.28.17	and hail will sweep away the refuge of lies,
ISA.28.17	and waters will overwhelm the shelter.”
ISA.28.18	Then your covenant with death will be annulled,
ISA.28.18	and your agreement with Sheol will not stand;
ISA.28.18	when the overwhelming scourge passes through
ISA.28.18	you will be beaten down by it.
ISA.28.19	As often as it passes through it will take you;
ISA.28.19	for morning by morning it will pass through,
ISA.28.19	by day and by night;
ISA.28.19	and it will be sheer terror to understand the message.
ISA.28.20	For the bed is too short to stretch oneself on it,
ISA.28.20	and the covering too narrow to wrap oneself in it.
ISA.28.21	For the 
ISA.28.21	he will be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon;
ISA.28.21	to do his deed—strange is his deed!
ISA.28.21	and to work his work—alien is his work!
ISA.28.22	Now therefore do not scoff,
ISA.28.22	lest your bonds be made strong;
ISA.28.22	for I have heard a decree of destruction
ISA.28.22	from the Lord 
ISA.28.23	Give ear, and hear my voice;
ISA.28.23	hearken, and hear my speech.
ISA.28.24	Does he who plows for sowing plow continually?
ISA.28.24	does he continually open and harrow his ground?
ISA.28.25	When he has leveled its surface,
ISA.28.25	does he not scatter dill, sow cummin,
ISA.28.25	and put in wheat in rows
ISA.28.25	and barley in its proper place,
ISA.28.25	and spelt as the border?
ISA.28.26	For he is instructed aright;
ISA.28.26	his God teaches him.
ISA.28.27	Dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge,
ISA.28.27	nor is a cart wheel rolled over cummin;
ISA.28.27	but dill is beaten out with a stick,
ISA.28.27	and cummin with a rod.
ISA.28.28	Does one crush bread grain?
ISA.28.28	No, he does not thresh it for ever;
ISA.28.28	when he drives his cart wheel over it
ISA.28.28	with his horses, he does not crush it.
ISA.28.29	This also comes from the 
ISA.28.29	he is wonderful in counsel,
ISA.28.29	and excellent in wisdom.
ISA.29.1	Ho Ariel, Ariel,
ISA.29.1	the city where David encamped!
ISA.29.1	Add year to year;
ISA.29.1	let the feasts run their round.
ISA.29.2	Yet I will distress Ariel,
ISA.29.2	and there shall be moaning and lamentation,
ISA.29.2	and she shall be to me like an Ariel.
ISA.29.3	And I will encamp against you round about,
ISA.29.3	and will besiege you with towers
ISA.29.3	and I will raise siegeworks against you.
ISA.29.4	Then deep from the earth you shall speak,
ISA.29.4	from low in the dust your words shall come;
ISA.29.4	your voice shall come from the ground like the voice of a ghost,
ISA.29.4	and your speech shall whisper out of the dust.
ISA.29.5	But the multitude of your foes
ISA.29.5	and the multitude of the ruthless like passing chaff.
ISA.29.5	And in an instant, suddenly,
ISA.29.6	you will be visited by the 
ISA.29.6	with thunder and with earthquake and great noise,
ISA.29.6	with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.
ISA.29.7	And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel,
ISA.29.7	all that fight against her and her stronghold and distress her,
ISA.29.7	shall be like a dream, a vision of the night.
ISA.29.8	As when a hungry man dreams he is eating
ISA.29.8	and awakes with his hunger not satisfied,
ISA.29.8	or as when a thirsty man dreams he is drinking
ISA.29.8	and awakes faint, with his thirst not quenched,
ISA.29.8	so shall the multitude of all the nations be
ISA.29.8	that fight against Mount Zion.
ISA.29.9	Stupefy yourselves and be in a stupor,
ISA.29.9	blind yourselves and be blind!
ISA.29.9	Be drunk, but not with wine;
ISA.29.9	stagger, but not with strong drink!
ISA.29.10	For the 
ISA.29.10	a spirit of deep sleep,
ISA.29.10	and has closed your eyes, the prophets,
ISA.29.10	and covered your heads, the seers.
ISA.29.11	And the vision of all this has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed. When men give it to one who can read, saying, “Read this,” he says, “I cannot, for it is sealed.” 
ISA.29.12	And when they give the book to one who cannot read, saying, “Read this,” he says, “I cannot read.”
ISA.29.13	“Because this people draw near with their mouth
ISA.29.13	and honor me with their lips,
ISA.29.13	while their hearts are far from me,
ISA.29.13	and their fear of me is a commandment of men learned by rote;
ISA.29.14	do marvelous things with this people,
ISA.29.14	wonderful and marvelous;
ISA.29.14	and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish,
ISA.29.14	and the discernment of their discerning men shall be hid.”
ISA.29.15	Woe to those who hide deep from the 
ISA.29.15	whose deeds are in the dark,
ISA.29.15	and who say, “Who sees us? Who knows us?”
ISA.29.16	Shall the potter be regarded as the clay;
ISA.29.16	that the thing made should say of its maker,
ISA.29.16	“He did not make me”;
ISA.29.16	or the thing formed say of him who formed it,
ISA.29.16	“He has no understanding”?
ISA.29.17	Is it not yet a very little while
ISA.29.17	until Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field,
ISA.29.17	and the fruitful field shall be regarded as a forest?
ISA.29.18	the words of a book,
ISA.29.18	and out of their gloom and darkness
ISA.29.18	the eyes of the blind shall see.
ISA.29.19	The meek shall obtain fresh joy in the 
ISA.29.19	and the poor among men shall exult in the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.29.20	For the ruthless shall come to naught and the scoffer cease,
ISA.29.20	and all who watch to do evil shall be cut off,
ISA.29.21	who by a word make a man out to be an offender,
ISA.29.21	and lay a snare for him who reproves in the gate,
ISA.29.21	and with an empty plea turn aside him who is in the right.
ISA.29.22	Therefore thus says the 
ISA.29.22	“Jacob shall no more be ashamed,
ISA.29.22	no more shall his face grow pale.
ISA.29.23	For when he sees his children,
ISA.29.23	the work of my hands, in his midst,
ISA.29.23	they will sanctify my name;
ISA.29.23	they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob,
ISA.29.23	and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.
ISA.29.24	And those who err in spirit will come to understanding,
ISA.29.24	and those who murmur will accept instruction.”
ISA.30.1	“Woe to the rebellious children,” says the 
ISA.30.1	“who carry out a plan, but not mine;
ISA.30.1	and who make a league, but not of my spirit,
ISA.30.1	that they may add sin to sin;
ISA.30.2	who set out to go down to Egypt,
ISA.30.2	without asking for my counsel,
ISA.30.2	to take refuge in the protection of Pharaoh,
ISA.30.2	and to seek shelter in the shadow of Egypt!
ISA.30.3	Therefore shall the protection of Pharaoh turn to your shame,
ISA.30.3	and the shelter in the shadow of Egypt to your humiliation.
ISA.30.4	For though his officials are at Zoan
ISA.30.4	and his envoys reach Hanes,
ISA.30.5	every one comes to shame
ISA.30.5	through a people that cannot profit them,
ISA.30.5	that brings neither help nor profit,
ISA.30.5	but shame and disgrace.”
ISA.30.6	An oracle on the beasts of the Negeb.
ISA.30.6	Through a land of trouble and anguish,
ISA.30.6	from where come the lioness and the lion,
ISA.30.6	the viper and the flying serpent,
ISA.30.6	they carry their riches on the backs of asses,
ISA.30.6	and their treasures on the humps of camels,
ISA.30.6	to a people that cannot profit them.
ISA.30.7	For Egypt's help is worthless and empty,
ISA.30.7	therefore I have called her
ISA.30.7	“Rahab who sits still.”
ISA.30.8	And now, go, write it before them on a tablet,
ISA.30.8	and inscribe it in a book,
ISA.30.8	that it may be for the time to come
ISA.30.8	as a witness for ever.
ISA.30.9	For they are a rebellious people,
ISA.30.9	lying sons,
ISA.30.9	sons who will not hear
ISA.30.9	the instruction of the 
ISA.30.10	who say to the seers, “See not”;
ISA.30.10	and to the prophets, “Prophesy not to us what is right;
ISA.30.10	speak to us smooth things,
ISA.30.10	prophesy illusions,
ISA.30.11	leave the way, turn aside from the path,
ISA.30.11	let us hear no more of the Holy One of Israel.”
ISA.30.12	Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel,
ISA.30.12	“Because you despise this word,
ISA.30.12	and trust in oppression and perverseness,
ISA.30.12	and rely on them;
ISA.30.13	therefore this iniquity shall be to you
ISA.30.13	like a break in a high wall, bulging out, and about to collapse,
ISA.30.13	whose crash comes suddenly, in an instant;
ISA.30.14	and its breaking is like that of a potter's vessel
ISA.30.14	which is smashed so ruthlessly
ISA.30.14	that among its fragments not a sherd is found
ISA.30.14	with which to take fire from the hearth,
ISA.30.14	or to dip up water out of the cistern.”
ISA.30.15	For thus said the Lord 
ISA.30.15	“In returning and rest you shall be saved;
ISA.30.15	in quietness and in trust shall be your strength.”
ISA.30.15	And you would not,
ISA.30.16	but you said,
ISA.30.16	“No! We will speed upon horses,”
ISA.30.16	therefore you shall speed away;
ISA.30.16	and, “We will ride upon swift steeds,”
ISA.30.16	therefore your pursuers shall be swift.
ISA.30.17	A thousand shall flee at the threat of one,
ISA.30.17	at the threat of five you shall flee,
ISA.30.17	till you are left
ISA.30.17	like a flagstaff on the top of a mountain,
ISA.30.17	like a signal on a hill.
ISA.30.18	Therefore the 
ISA.30.18	therefore he exalts himself to show mercy to you.
ISA.30.18	For the 
ISA.30.18	blessed are all those who wait for him.
ISA.30.19	Yea, O people in Zion who dwell at Jerusalem; you shall weep no more. He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry; when he hears it, he will answer you. 
ISA.30.20	And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your Teacher will not hide himself any more, but your eyes shall see your Teacher. 
ISA.30.21	And your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, “This is the way, walk in it,” when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left. 
ISA.30.22	Then you will defile your silver-covered graven images and your gold-plated molten images. You will scatter them as unclean things; you will say to them, “Begone!”
ISA.30.23	And he will give rain for the seed with which you sow the ground, and grain, the produce of the ground, which will be rich and plenteous. In that day your cattle will graze in large pastures; 
ISA.30.24	and the oxen and the asses that till the ground will eat salted provender, which has been winnowed with shovel and fork. 
ISA.30.25	And upon every lofty mountain and every high hill there will be brooks running with water, in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall. 
ISA.30.26	Moreover the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day when the 
ISA.30.27	Behold, the name of the 
ISA.30.27	burning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke;
ISA.30.27	his lips are full of indignation,
ISA.30.27	and his tongue is like a devouring fire;
ISA.30.28	his breath is like an overflowing stream
ISA.30.28	that reaches up to the neck;
ISA.30.28	to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction,
ISA.30.28	and to place on the jaws of the peoples a bridle that leads astray.
ISA.30.29	You shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one sets out to the sound of the flute to go to the mountain of the 
ISA.30.30	And the 
ISA.30.31	The Assyrians will be terror-stricken at the voice of the 
ISA.30.32	And every stroke of the staff of punishment which the 
ISA.30.33	For a burning place
ISA.31.1	Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help
ISA.31.1	and rely on horses,
ISA.31.1	who trust in chariots because they are many
ISA.31.1	and in horsemen because they are very strong,
ISA.31.1	but do not look to the Holy One of Israel
ISA.31.1	or consult the 
ISA.31.2	And yet he is wise and brings disaster,
ISA.31.2	he does not call back his words,
ISA.31.2	but will arise against the house of the evildoers,
ISA.31.2	and against the helpers of those who work iniquity.
ISA.31.3	The Egyptians are men, and not God;
ISA.31.3	and their horses are flesh, and not spirit.
ISA.31.3	When the 
ISA.31.3	the helper will stumble, and he who is helped will fall,
ISA.31.3	and they will all perish together.
ISA.31.4	For thus the 
ISA.31.4	As a lion or a young lion growls over his prey,
ISA.31.4	and when a band of shepherds is called forth against him
ISA.31.4	is not terrified by their shouting
ISA.31.4	or daunted at their noise,
ISA.31.4	so the 
ISA.31.4	to fight upon Mount Zion and upon its hill.
ISA.31.5	Like birds hovering, so the 
ISA.31.5	will protect Jerusalem;
ISA.31.5	he will protect and deliver it,
ISA.31.5	he will spare and rescue it.
ISA.31.6	Turn to him from whom you
ISA.31.7	For in that day every one shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which your hands have sinfully made for you.
ISA.31.8	“And the Assyrian shall fall by a sword, not of man;
ISA.31.8	and a sword, not of man, shall devour him;
ISA.31.8	and he shall flee from the sword,
ISA.31.8	and his young men shall be put to forced labor.
ISA.31.9	His rock shall pass away in terror,
ISA.31.9	and his officers desert the standard in panic,”
ISA.31.9	says the 
ISA.31.9	and whose furnace is in Jerusalem.
ISA.32.1	Behold, a king will reign in righteousness,
ISA.32.1	and princes will rule in justice.
ISA.32.2	Each will be like a hiding place from the wind,
ISA.32.2	a covert from the tempest,
ISA.32.2	like streams of water in a dry place,
ISA.32.2	like the shade of a great rock in a weary land.
ISA.32.3	Then the eyes of those who see will not be closed,
ISA.32.3	and the ears of those who hear will hearken.
ISA.32.4	The mind of the rash will have good judgment,
ISA.32.4	and the tongue of the stammerers will speak readily and distinctly.
ISA.32.5	The fool will no more be called noble,
ISA.32.5	nor the knave said to be honorable.
ISA.32.6	For the fool speaks folly,
ISA.32.6	and his mind plots iniquity:
ISA.32.6	to practice ungodliness,
ISA.32.6	to utter error concerning the 
ISA.32.6	to leave the craving of the hungry unsatisfied,
ISA.32.6	and to deprive the thirsty of drink.
ISA.32.7	The knaveries of the knave are evil;
ISA.32.7	he devises wicked devices
ISA.32.7	to ruin the poor with lying words,
ISA.32.7	even when the plea of the needy is right.
ISA.32.8	But he who is noble devises noble things,
ISA.32.8	and by noble things he stands.
ISA.32.9	Rise up, you women who are at ease, hear my voice;
ISA.32.9	you complacent daughters, give ear to my speech.
ISA.32.10	In little more than a year
ISA.32.10	you will shudder, you complacent women;
ISA.32.10	for the vintage will fail,
ISA.32.10	the fruit harvest will not come.
ISA.32.11	Tremble, you women who are at ease,
ISA.32.11	shudder, you complacent ones;
ISA.32.11	strip, and make yourselves bare,
ISA.32.11	and gird sackcloth upon your loins.
ISA.32.12	Beat upon your breasts for the pleasant fields,
ISA.32.12	for the fruitful vine,
ISA.32.13	for the soil of my people
ISA.32.13	growing up in thorns and briers;
ISA.32.13	yea, for all the joyous houses
ISA.32.13	in the joyful city.
ISA.32.14	For the palace will be forsaken,
ISA.32.14	the populous city deserted;
ISA.32.14	the hill and the watchtower
ISA.32.14	will become dens for ever,
ISA.32.14	a joy of wild asses,
ISA.32.14	a pasture of flocks;
ISA.32.15	until the Spirit is poured upon us from on high,
ISA.32.15	and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field,
ISA.32.15	and the fruitful field is deemed a forest.
ISA.32.16	Then justice will dwell in the wilderness,
ISA.32.16	and righteousness abide in the fruitful field.
ISA.32.17	And the effect of righteousness will be peace,
ISA.32.17	and the result of righteousness, quietness and trust for ever.
ISA.32.18	My people will abide in a peaceful habitation,
ISA.32.18	in secure dwellings, and in quiet resting places.
ISA.32.19	And the forest will utterly go down,
ISA.32.19	and the city will be utterly laid low.
ISA.32.20	Happy are you who sow beside all waters,
ISA.32.20	who let the feet of the ox and the ass range free.
ISA.33.1	Woe to you, destroyer,
ISA.33.1	who yourself have not been destroyed;
ISA.33.1	you treacherous one,
ISA.33.1	with whom none has dealt treacherously!
ISA.33.1	When you have ceased to destroy,
ISA.33.1	you will be destroyed;
ISA.33.1	and when you have made an end of dealing treacherously,
ISA.33.1	you will be dealt with treacherously.
ISA.33.2	O 
ISA.33.2	Be our arm every morning,
ISA.33.2	our salvation in the time of trouble.
ISA.33.3	At the thunderous noise peoples flee,
ISA.33.3	at the lifting up of thyself nations are scattered;
ISA.33.4	and spoil is gathered as the caterpillar gathers;
ISA.33.4	as locusts leap, men leap upon it.
ISA.33.5	The 
ISA.33.5	he will fill Zion with justice and righteousness;
ISA.33.6	and he will be the stability of your times,
ISA.33.6	abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge;
ISA.33.6	the fear of the 
ISA.33.7	Behold, the valiant ones
ISA.33.7	the envoys of peace weep bitterly.
ISA.33.8	The highways lie waste,
ISA.33.8	the wayfaring man ceases.
ISA.33.8	Covenants are broken,
ISA.33.8	witnesses
ISA.33.8	there is no regard for man.
ISA.33.9	The land mourns and languishes;
ISA.33.9	Lebanon is confounded and withers away;
ISA.33.9	Sharon is like a desert;
ISA.33.9	and Bashan and Carmel shake off their leaves.
ISA.33.10	“Now I will arise,” says the 
ISA.33.10	“now I will lift myself up;
ISA.33.10	now I will be exalted.
ISA.33.11	You conceive chaff, you bring forth stubble;
ISA.33.11	your breath is a fire that will consume you.
ISA.33.12	And the peoples will be as if burned to lime,
ISA.33.12	like thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire.”
ISA.33.13	Hear, you who are far off, what I have done;
ISA.33.13	and you who are near, acknowledge my might.
ISA.33.14	The sinners in Zion are afraid;
ISA.33.14	trembling has seized the godless:
ISA.33.14	“Who among us can dwell with the devouring fire?
ISA.33.14	Who among us can dwell with everlasting burnings?”
ISA.33.15	He who walks righteously and speaks uprightly,
ISA.33.15	who despises the gain of oppressions,
ISA.33.15	who shakes his hands, lest they hold a bribe,
ISA.33.15	who stops his ears from hearing of bloodshed
ISA.33.15	and shuts his eyes from looking upon evil,
ISA.33.16	he will dwell on the heights;
ISA.33.16	his place of defense will be the fortresses of rocks;
ISA.33.16	his bread will be given him, his water will be sure.
ISA.33.17	Your eyes will see the king in his beauty;
ISA.33.17	they will behold a land that stretches afar.
ISA.33.18	Your mind will muse on the terror:
ISA.33.18	“Where is he who counted, where is he who weighed the tribute?
ISA.33.18	Where is he who counted the towers?”
ISA.33.19	You will see no more the insolent people,
ISA.33.19	the people of an obscure speech which you cannot comprehend,
ISA.33.19	stammering in a tongue which you cannot understand.
ISA.33.20	Look upon Zion, the city of our appointed feasts!
ISA.33.20	Your eyes will see Jerusalem,
ISA.33.20	a quiet habitation, an immovable tent,
ISA.33.20	whose stakes will never be plucked up,
ISA.33.20	nor will any of its cords be broken.
ISA.33.21	But there the 
ISA.33.21	a place of broad rivers and streams,
ISA.33.21	where no galley with oars can go,
ISA.33.21	nor stately ship can pass.
ISA.33.22	For the 
ISA.33.22	the 
ISA.33.23	Your tackle hangs loose;
ISA.33.23	it cannot hold the mast firm in its place,
ISA.33.23	or keep the sail spread out.
ISA.33.23	Then prey and spoil in abundance will be divided;
ISA.33.23	even the lame will take the prey.
ISA.33.24	And no inhabitant will say, “I am sick”;
ISA.33.24	the people who dwell there will be forgiven their iniquity.
ISA.34.1	and hearken, O peoples!
ISA.34.1	Let the earth listen, and all that fills it;
ISA.34.1	the world, and all that comes from it.
ISA.34.2	For the 
ISA.34.2	and furious against all their host,
ISA.34.2	he has doomed them, has given them over for slaughter.
ISA.34.3	Their slain shall be cast out,
ISA.34.3	and the stench of their corpses shall rise;
ISA.34.3	the mountains shall flow with their blood.
ISA.34.4	and the skies roll up like a scroll.
ISA.34.4	All their host shall fall,
ISA.34.4	as leaves fall from the vine,
ISA.34.4	like leaves falling from the fig tree.
ISA.34.5	For my sword has drunk its fill in the heavens;
ISA.34.5	behold, it descends for judgment upon Edom,
ISA.34.5	upon the people I have doomed.
ISA.34.6	The 
ISA.34.6	it is gorged with fat,
ISA.34.6	with the blood of lambs and goats,
ISA.34.6	with the fat of the kidneys of rams.
ISA.34.6	For the 
ISA.34.6	a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
ISA.34.7	Wild oxen shall fall with them,
ISA.34.7	and young steers with the mighty bulls.
ISA.34.7	Their land shall be soaked with blood,
ISA.34.7	and their soil made rich with fat.
ISA.34.8	For the 
ISA.34.8	a year of recompense for the cause of Zion.
ISA.34.9	and her soil into brimstone;
ISA.34.9	her land shall become burning pitch.
ISA.34.10	Night and day it shall not be quenched;
ISA.34.10	its smoke shall go up for ever.
ISA.34.10	From generation to generation it shall lie waste;
ISA.34.10	none shall pass through it for ever and ever.
ISA.34.11	But the hawk and the porcupine shall possess it,
ISA.34.11	the owl and the raven shall dwell in it.
ISA.34.11	He shall stretch the line of confusion over it,
ISA.34.11	and the plummet of chaos over
ISA.34.12	They shall name it No Kingdom There,
ISA.34.12	and all its princes shall be nothing.
ISA.34.13	Thorns shall grow over its strongholds,
ISA.34.13	nettles and thistles in its fortresses.
ISA.34.13	It shall be the haunt of jackals,
ISA.34.13	an abode for ostriches.
ISA.34.14	And wild beasts shall meet with hyenas,
ISA.34.14	the satyr shall cry to his fellow;
ISA.34.14	yea, there shall the night hag alight,
ISA.34.14	and find for herself a resting place.
ISA.34.15	There shall the owl nest and lay
ISA.34.15	and hatch and gather her young in her shadow;
ISA.34.15	yea, there shall the kites be gathered,
ISA.34.15	each one with her mate.
ISA.34.16	Seek and read from the book of the 
ISA.34.16	Not one of these shall be missing;
ISA.34.16	none shall be without her mate.
ISA.34.16	For the mouth of the 
ISA.34.16	and his Spirit has gathered them.
ISA.34.17	He has cast the lot for them,
ISA.34.17	his hand has portioned it out to them with the line;
ISA.34.17	they shall possess it for ever,
ISA.34.17	from generation to generation they shall dwell in it.
ISA.35.1	The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad,
ISA.35.1	the desert shall rejoice and blossom;
ISA.35.1	like the crocus
ISA.35.2	it shall blossom abundantly,
ISA.35.2	and rejoice with joy and singing.
ISA.35.2	The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it,
ISA.35.2	the majesty of Carmel and Sharon.
ISA.35.2	They shall see the glory of the 
ISA.35.2	the majesty of our God.
ISA.35.3	and make firm the feeble knees.
ISA.35.4	Say to those who are of a fearful heart,
ISA.35.4	“Be strong, fear not!
ISA.35.4	Behold, your God
ISA.35.4	will come with vengeance,
ISA.35.4	with the recompense of God.
ISA.35.4	He will come and save you.”
ISA.35.5	and the ears of the deaf unstopped;
ISA.35.6	then shall the lame man leap like a hart,
ISA.35.6	and the tongue of the dumb sing for joy.
ISA.35.6	For waters shall break forth in the wilderness,
ISA.35.6	and streams in the desert;
ISA.35.7	the burning sand shall become a pool,
ISA.35.7	and the thirsty ground springs of water;
ISA.35.7	the haunt of jackals shall become a swamp,
ISA.35.7	the grass shall become reeds and rushes.
ISA.35.8	And a highway shall be there,
ISA.35.8	and it shall be called the Holy Way;
ISA.35.8	the unclean shall not pass over it,
ISA.35.8	and fools shall not err therein.
ISA.35.9	No lion shall be there,
ISA.35.9	nor shall any ravenous beast come up on it;
ISA.35.9	they shall not be found there,
ISA.35.9	but the redeemed shall walk there.
ISA.35.10	And the ransomed of the 
ISA.35.10	and come to Zion with singing;
ISA.35.10	everlasting joy shall be upon their heads;
ISA.35.10	they shall obtain joy and gladness,
ISA.35.10	and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
ISA.36.2	And the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem, with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Fuller's Field. 
ISA.36.3	And there came out to him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder.
ISA.36.4	And the Rabshakeh said to them, “Say to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: On what do you rest this confidence of yours? 
ISA.36.5	Do you think that mere words are strategy and power for war? On whom do you now rely, that you have rebelled against me? 
ISA.36.6	Behold, you are relying on Egypt, that broken reed of a staff, which will pierce the hand of any man who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who rely on him. 
ISA.36.7	But if you say to me, “We rely on the 
ISA.36.8	Come now, make a wager with my master the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders upon them. 
ISA.36.9	How then can you repulse a single captain among the least of my master's servants, when you rely on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? 
ISA.36.10	Moreover, is it without the 
ISA.36.11	Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, “Pray, speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it; do not speak to us in the language of Judah within the hearing of the people who are on the wall.” 
ISA.36.12	But the Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me to speak these words to your master and to you, and not to the men sitting on the wall, who are doomed with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?”
ISA.36.13	Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the language of Judah: “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria! 
ISA.36.14	Thus says the king: ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you. 
ISA.36.15	Do not let Hezekiah make you rely on the 
ISA.36.16	Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria: Make your peace with me and come out to me; then every one of you will eat of his own vine, and every one of his own fig tree, and every one of you will drink the water of his own cistern; 
ISA.36.17	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. 
ISA.36.18	Beware lest Hezekiah mislead you by saying, “The 
ISA.36.19	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? 
ISA.36.20	Who among all the gods of these countries have delivered their countries out of my hand, that the 
ISA.36.21	But they were silent and answered him not a word, for the king's command was, “Do not answer him.” 
ISA.36.22	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of the Rabshakeh.
ISA.37.1	When King Hezekiah heard it, he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the 
ISA.37.2	And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and the senior priests, clothed with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz. 
ISA.37.3	They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, ‘This day is a day of distress, of rebuke, and of disgrace; children have come to the birth, and there is no strength to bring them forth. 
ISA.37.4	It may be that the 
ISA.37.5	When the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah, 
ISA.37.6	Isaiah said to them, “Say to your master, ‘Thus says the 
ISA.37.7	Behold, I will put a spirit in him, so that he shall hear a rumor, and return to his own land; and I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.’ ”
ISA.37.8	The Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah; for he had heard that the king had left Lachish. 
ISA.37.9	Now the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “He has set out to fight against you.” And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, 
ISA.37.10	“Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah: ‘Do not let your God on whom you rely deceive you by promising that Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. 
ISA.37.11	Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, destroying them utterly. And shall you be delivered? 
ISA.37.12	Have the gods of the nations delivered them, the nations which my fathers destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar? 
ISA.37.13	Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, the king of Hena, or the king of Ivvah?’ ”
ISA.37.14	Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the 
ISA.37.15	And Hezekiah prayed to the 
ISA.37.16	“O 
ISA.37.17	Incline thy ear, O 
ISA.37.18	Of a truth, O 
ISA.37.19	and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore they were destroyed. 
ISA.37.20	So now, O 
ISA.37.21	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says the 
ISA.37.22	this is the word that the 
ISA.37.22	“ ‘She despises you, she scorns you—
ISA.37.22	the virgin daughter of Zion;
ISA.37.22	she wags her head behind you—
ISA.37.22	the daughter of Jerusalem.
ISA.37.23	“ ‘Whom have you mocked and reviled?
ISA.37.23	Against whom have you raised your voice
ISA.37.23	and haughtily lifted your eyes?
ISA.37.23	Against the Holy One of Israel!
ISA.37.24	By your servants you have mocked the Lord,
ISA.37.24	and you have said, With my many chariots
ISA.37.24	I have gone up the heights of the mountains,
ISA.37.24	to the far recesses of Lebanon;
ISA.37.24	I felled its tallest cedars,
ISA.37.24	its choicest cypresses;
ISA.37.24	I came to its remotest height,
ISA.37.24	its densest forest.
ISA.37.25	I dug wells
ISA.37.25	and drank waters,
ISA.37.25	and I dried up with the sole of my foot
ISA.37.25	all the streams of Egypt.
ISA.37.26	“ ‘Have you not heard
ISA.37.26	that I determined it long ago?
ISA.37.26	I planned from days of old
ISA.37.26	what now I bring to pass,
ISA.37.26	that you should make fortified cities
ISA.37.26	crash into heaps of ruins,
ISA.37.27	while their inhabitants, shorn of strength,
ISA.37.27	are dismayed and confounded,
ISA.37.27	and have become like plants of the field
ISA.37.27	and like tender grass,
ISA.37.27	like grass on the housetops,
ISA.37.27	blighted
ISA.37.28	“ ‘I know your sitting down
ISA.37.28	and your going out and coming in,
ISA.37.28	and your raging against me.
ISA.37.29	Because you have raged against me
ISA.37.29	and your arrogance has come to my ears,
ISA.37.29	I will put my hook in your nose
ISA.37.29	and my bit in your mouth,
ISA.37.29	and I will turn you back on the way
ISA.37.29	by which you came.’
ISA.37.30	“And this shall be the sign for you: this year eat what grows of itself, and in the second year what springs of the same; then in the third year sow and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. 
ISA.37.31	And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward; 
ISA.37.32	for out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the 
ISA.37.33	“Therefore thus says the 
ISA.37.34	By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and he shall not come into this city, says the 
ISA.37.35	For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David.”
ISA.37.36	And the angel of the 
ISA.37.37	Then Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went home and dwelt at Nineveh. 
ISA.37.38	And as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, slew him with the sword, and escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.
ISA.38.1	In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, “Thus says the 
ISA.38.2	Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the 
ISA.38.3	and said, “Remember now, O 
ISA.38.4	Then the word of the 
ISA.38.5	“Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus says the 
ISA.38.6	I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and defend this city.
ISA.38.7	“This is the sign to you from the 
ISA.38.8	Behold, I will make the shadow cast by the declining sun on the dial of Ahaz turn back ten steps.” So the sun turned back on the dial the ten steps by which it had declined.
ISA.38.9	A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, after he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:
ISA.38.10	I said, In the noontide of my days
ISA.38.10	I must depart;
ISA.38.10	I am consigned to the gates of Sheol
ISA.38.10	for the rest of my years.
ISA.38.11	I said, I shall not see the 
ISA.38.11	in the land of the living;
ISA.38.11	I shall look upon man no more
ISA.38.11	among the inhabitants of the world.
ISA.38.12	My dwelling is plucked up and removed from me
ISA.38.12	like a shepherd's tent;
ISA.38.12	like a weaver I have rolled up my life;
ISA.38.12	he cuts me off from the loom;
ISA.38.12	from day to night thou dost bring me to an end;
ISA.38.13	I cry for help
ISA.38.13	like a lion he breaks all my bones;
ISA.38.13	from day to night thou dost bring me to an end.
ISA.38.14	Like a swallow or a crane
ISA.38.14	I moan like a dove.
ISA.38.14	My eyes are weary with looking upward.
ISA.38.14	O Lord, I am oppressed; be thou my security!
ISA.38.15	But what can I say? For he has spoken to me,
ISA.38.15	and he himself has done it.
ISA.38.15	All my sleep has fled
ISA.38.15	because of the bitterness of my soul.
ISA.38.16	O Lord, by these things men live,
ISA.38.16	and in all these is the life of my spirit.
ISA.38.16	Oh, restore me to health and make me live!
ISA.38.17	Lo, it was for my welfare
ISA.38.17	that I had great bitterness;
ISA.38.17	but thou hast held back
ISA.38.17	from the pit of destruction,
ISA.38.17	for thou hast cast all my sins
ISA.38.17	behind thy back.
ISA.38.18	For Sheol cannot thank thee,
ISA.38.18	death cannot praise thee;
ISA.38.18	those who go down to the pit cannot hope
ISA.38.18	for thy faithfulness.
ISA.38.19	The living, the living, he thanks thee,
ISA.38.19	as I do this day;
ISA.38.19	the father makes known to the children
ISA.38.19	thy faithfulness.
ISA.38.20	The 
ISA.38.20	and we will sing to stringed instruments
ISA.38.20	all the days of our life,
ISA.38.20	at the house of the 
ISA.38.21	Now Isaiah had said, “Let them take a cake of figs, and apply it to the boil, that he may recover.” 
ISA.38.22	Hezekiah also had said, “What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the 
ISA.39.2	And Hezekiah welcomed them; and he showed them his treasure house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, his whole armory, all that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them. 
ISA.39.3	Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, “What did these men say? And whence did they come to you?” Hezekiah said, “They have come to me from a far country, from Babylon.” 
ISA.39.4	He said, “What have they seen in your house?” Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing in my storehouses that I did not show them.”
ISA.39.5	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the 
ISA.39.6	Behold, the days are coming, when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have stored up till this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, says the 
ISA.39.7	And some of your own sons, who are born to you, shall be taken away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.” 
ISA.39.8	Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, “The word of the 
ISA.40.1	Comfort, comfort my people,
ISA.40.1	says your God.
ISA.40.2	Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,
ISA.40.2	and cry to her
ISA.40.2	that her warfare
ISA.40.2	that her iniquity is pardoned,
ISA.40.2	that she has received from the 
ISA.40.2	double for all her sins.
ISA.40.3	“In the wilderness prepare the way of the 
ISA.40.3	make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
ISA.40.4	and every mountain and hill be made low;
ISA.40.4	the uneven ground shall become level,
ISA.40.4	and the rough places a plain.
ISA.40.5	And the glory of the 
ISA.40.5	and all flesh shall see it together,
ISA.40.5	for the mouth of the 
ISA.40.6	And I said, “What shall I cry?”
ISA.40.6	All flesh is grass,
ISA.40.6	and all its beauty is like the flower of the field.
ISA.40.7	The grass withers, the flower fades,
ISA.40.7	when the breath of the 
ISA.40.7	surely the people is grass.
ISA.40.8	The grass withers, the flower fades;
ISA.40.8	but the word of our God will stand for ever.
ISA.40.9	O Zion, herald of good tidings;
ISA.40.9	lift up your voice with strength,
ISA.40.9	O Jerusalem, herald of good tidings,
ISA.40.9	lift it up, fear not;
ISA.40.9	say to the cities of Judah,
ISA.40.9	“Behold your God!”
ISA.40.10	and his arm rules for him;
ISA.40.10	behold, his reward is with him,
ISA.40.10	and his recompense before him.
ISA.40.11	He will feed his flock like a shepherd,
ISA.40.11	he will gather the lambs in his arms,
ISA.40.11	he will carry them in his bosom,
ISA.40.11	and gently lead those that are with young.
ISA.40.12	Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand
ISA.40.12	and marked off the heavens with a span,
ISA.40.12	enclosed the dust of the earth in a measure
ISA.40.12	and weighed the mountains in scales
ISA.40.12	and the hills in a balance?
ISA.40.13	or as his counselor has instructed him?
ISA.40.14	Whom did he consult for his enlightenment,
ISA.40.14	and who taught him the path of justice,
ISA.40.14	and taught him knowledge,
ISA.40.14	and showed him the way of understanding?
ISA.40.15	Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket,
ISA.40.15	and are accounted as the dust on the scales;
ISA.40.15	behold, he takes up the isles like fine dust.
ISA.40.16	Lebanon would not suffice for fuel,
ISA.40.16	nor are its beasts enough for a burnt offering.
ISA.40.17	All the nations are as nothing before him,
ISA.40.17	they are accounted by him as less than nothing and emptiness.
ISA.40.18	To whom then will you liken God,
ISA.40.18	or what likeness compare with him?
ISA.40.19	The idol! a workman casts it,
ISA.40.19	and a goldsmith overlays it with gold,
ISA.40.19	and casts for it silver chains.
ISA.40.20	He who is impoverished
ISA.40.20	wood that will not rot;
ISA.40.20	he seeks out a skilful craftsman
ISA.40.20	to set up an image that will not move.
ISA.40.21	Have you not known? Have you not heard?
ISA.40.21	Has it not been told you from the beginning?
ISA.40.21	Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?
ISA.40.22	It is he who sits above the circle of the earth,
ISA.40.22	and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers;
ISA.40.22	who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,
ISA.40.22	and spreads them like a tent to dwell in;
ISA.40.23	who brings princes to naught,
ISA.40.23	and makes the rulers of the earth as nothing.
ISA.40.24	Scarcely are they planted, scarcely sown,
ISA.40.24	scarcely has their stem taken root in the earth,
ISA.40.24	when he blows upon them, and they wither,
ISA.40.24	and the tempest carries them off like stubble.
ISA.40.25	To whom then will you compare me,
ISA.40.25	that I should be like him? says the Holy One.
ISA.40.26	Lift up your eyes on high and see:
ISA.40.26	who created these?
ISA.40.26	He who brings out their host by number,
ISA.40.26	calling them all by name;
ISA.40.26	by the greatness of his might,
ISA.40.26	and because he is strong in power
ISA.40.26	not one is missing.
ISA.40.27	Why do you say, O Jacob,
ISA.40.27	and speak, O Israel,
ISA.40.27	“My way is hid from the 
ISA.40.27	and my right is disregarded by my God”?
ISA.40.28	Have you not known? Have you not heard?
ISA.40.28	The 
ISA.40.28	the Creator of the ends of the earth.
ISA.40.28	He does not faint or grow weary,
ISA.40.28	his understanding is unsearchable.
ISA.40.29	He gives power to the faint,
ISA.40.29	and to him who has no might he increases strength.
ISA.40.30	Even youths shall faint and be weary,
ISA.40.30	and young men shall fall exhausted;
ISA.40.31	but they who wait for the 
ISA.40.31	they shall mount up with wings like eagles,
ISA.40.31	they shall run and not be weary,
ISA.40.31	they shall walk and not faint.
ISA.41.1	Listen to me in silence, O coastlands;
ISA.41.1	let the peoples renew their strength;
ISA.41.1	let them approach, then let them speak;
ISA.41.1	let us together draw near for judgment.
ISA.41.2	Who stirred up one from the east
ISA.41.2	whom victory meets at every step?
ISA.41.2	He gives up nations before him,
ISA.41.2	so that he tramples kings under foot;
ISA.41.2	he makes them like dust with his sword,
ISA.41.2	like driven stubble with his bow.
ISA.41.3	He pursues them and passes on safely,
ISA.41.3	by paths his feet have not trod.
ISA.41.4	Who has performed and done this,
ISA.41.4	calling the generations from the beginning?
ISA.41.4	I, the 
ISA.41.4	and with the last; I am He.
ISA.41.5	The coastlands have seen and are afraid,
ISA.41.5	the ends of the earth tremble;
ISA.41.5	they have drawn near and come.
ISA.41.6	Every one helps his neighbor,
ISA.41.6	and says to his brother, “Take courage!”
ISA.41.7	The craftsman encourages the goldsmith,
ISA.41.7	and he who smooths with the hammer him who strikes the anvil,
ISA.41.7	saying of the soldering, “It is good”;
ISA.41.7	and they fasten it with nails so that it cannot be moved.
ISA.41.8	Jacob, whom I have chosen,
ISA.41.8	the offspring of Abraham, my friend;
ISA.41.9	you whom I took from the ends of the earth,
ISA.41.9	and called from its farthest corners,
ISA.41.9	saying to you, “You are my servant,
ISA.41.9	I have chosen you and not cast you off”;
ISA.41.10	be not dismayed, for I am your God;
ISA.41.10	I will strengthen you, I will help you,
ISA.41.10	I will uphold you with my victorious right hand.
ISA.41.11	Behold, all who are incensed against you
ISA.41.11	shall be put to shame and confounded;
ISA.41.11	those who strive against you
ISA.41.11	shall be as nothing and shall perish.
ISA.41.12	You shall seek those who contend with you,
ISA.41.12	but you shall not find them;
ISA.41.12	those who war against you
ISA.41.12	shall be as nothing at all.
ISA.41.13	For I, the 
ISA.41.13	hold your right hand;
ISA.41.13	it is I who say to you, “Fear not,
ISA.41.13	I will help you.”
ISA.41.14	Fear not, you worm Jacob,
ISA.41.14	you men of Israel!
ISA.41.14	I will help you, says the 
ISA.41.14	your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.41.15	Behold, I will make of you a threshing sledge,
ISA.41.15	new, sharp, and having teeth;
ISA.41.15	you shall thresh the mountains and crush them,
ISA.41.15	and you shall make the hills like chaff;
ISA.41.16	you shall winnow them and the wind shall carry them away,
ISA.41.16	and the tempest shall scatter them.
ISA.41.16	And you shall rejoice in the 
ISA.41.16	in the Holy One of Israel you shall glory.
ISA.41.17	When the poor and needy seek water,
ISA.41.17	and there is none,
ISA.41.17	and their tongue is parched with thirst,
ISA.41.17	I the 
ISA.41.17	I the God of Israel will not forsake them.
ISA.41.18	I will open rivers on the bare heights,
ISA.41.18	and fountains in the midst of the valleys;
ISA.41.18	I will make the wilderness a pool of water,
ISA.41.18	and the dry land springs of water.
ISA.41.19	I will put in the wilderness the cedar,
ISA.41.19	the acacia, the myrtle, and the olive;
ISA.41.19	I will set in the desert the cypress,
ISA.41.19	the plane and the pine together;
ISA.41.20	that men may see and know,
ISA.41.20	may consider and understand together,
ISA.41.20	that the hand of the 
ISA.41.20	the Holy One of Israel has created it.
ISA.41.21	Set forth your case, says the 
ISA.41.21	bring your proofs, says the King of Jacob.
ISA.41.22	Let them bring them, and tell us what is to happen.
ISA.41.22	Tell us the former things, what they are,
ISA.41.22	that we may consider them,
ISA.41.22	that we may know their outcome;
ISA.41.22	or declare to us the things to come.
ISA.41.23	Tell us what is to come hereafter,
ISA.41.23	that we may know that you are gods;
ISA.41.23	do good, or do harm,
ISA.41.23	that we may be dismayed and terrified.
ISA.41.24	Behold, you are nothing,
ISA.41.24	and your work is naught;
ISA.41.24	an abomination is he who chooses you.
ISA.41.25	I stirred up one from the north, and he has come,
ISA.41.25	from the rising of the sun, and he shall call on my name;
ISA.41.25	he shall trample
ISA.41.25	as the potter treads clay.
ISA.41.26	Who declared it from the beginning, that we might know,
ISA.41.26	and beforetime, that we might say, “He is right”?
ISA.41.26	There was none who declared it, none who proclaimed,
ISA.41.26	none who heard your words.
ISA.41.27	I first have declared it to Zion,
ISA.41.27	and I give to Jerusalem a herald of good tidings.
ISA.41.28	But when I look there is no one;
ISA.41.28	among these there is no counselor
ISA.41.28	who, when I ask, gives an answer.
ISA.41.29	Behold, they are all a delusion;
ISA.41.29	their works are nothing;
ISA.41.29	their molten images are empty wind.
ISA.42.1	my chosen, in whom my soul delights;
ISA.42.1	I have put my Spirit upon him,
ISA.42.1	he will bring forth justice to the nations.
ISA.42.2	He will not cry or lift up his voice,
ISA.42.2	or make it heard in the street;
ISA.42.3	a bruised reed he will not break,
ISA.42.3	and a dimly burning wick he will not quench;
ISA.42.3	he will faithfully bring forth justice.
ISA.42.4	He will not fail
ISA.42.4	till he has established justice in the earth;
ISA.42.4	and the coastlands wait for his law.
ISA.42.5	who created the heavens and stretched them out,
ISA.42.5	who spread forth the earth and what comes from it,
ISA.42.5	who gives breath to the people upon it
ISA.42.5	and spirit to those who walk in it:
ISA.42.6	I have taken you by the hand and kept you;
ISA.42.6	I have given you as a covenant to the people,
ISA.42.6	a light to the nations,
ISA.42.7	to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon,
ISA.42.7	from the prison those who sit in darkness.
ISA.42.8	I am the 
ISA.42.8	my glory I give to no other,
ISA.42.8	nor my praise to graven images.
ISA.42.9	Behold, the former things have come to pass,
ISA.42.9	and new things I now declare;
ISA.42.9	before they spring forth
ISA.42.9	I tell you of them.”
ISA.42.10	Sing to the 
ISA.42.10	his praise from the end of the earth!
ISA.42.10	Let the sea roar
ISA.42.10	the coastlands and their inhabitants.
ISA.42.11	Let the desert and its cities lift up their voice,
ISA.42.11	the villages that Kedar inhabits;
ISA.42.11	let the inhabitants of Sela sing for joy,
ISA.42.11	let them shout from the top of the mountains.
ISA.42.12	Let them give glory to the 
ISA.42.12	and declare his praise in the coastlands.
ISA.42.13	The 
ISA.42.13	like a man of war he stirs up his fury;
ISA.42.13	he cries out, he shouts aloud,
ISA.42.13	he shows himself mighty against his foes.
ISA.42.14	For a long time I have held my peace,
ISA.42.14	I have kept still and restrained myself;
ISA.42.14	now I will cry out like a woman in travail,
ISA.42.14	I will gasp and pant.
ISA.42.15	I will lay waste mountains and hills,
ISA.42.15	and dry up all their herbage;
ISA.42.15	I will turn the rivers into islands,
ISA.42.15	and dry up the pools.
ISA.42.16	And I will lead the blind
ISA.42.16	in a way that they know not,
ISA.42.16	in paths that they have not known
ISA.42.16	I will guide them.
ISA.42.16	I will turn the darkness before them into light,
ISA.42.16	the rough places into level ground.
ISA.42.16	These are the things I will do,
ISA.42.16	and I will not forsake them.
ISA.42.17	They shall be turned back and utterly put to shame,
ISA.42.17	who trust in graven images,
ISA.42.17	who say to molten images,
ISA.42.17	“You are our gods.”
ISA.42.18	Hear, you deaf;
ISA.42.18	and look, you blind, that you may see!
ISA.42.19	Who is blind but my servant,
ISA.42.19	or deaf as my messenger whom I send?
ISA.42.19	Who is blind as my dedicated one,
ISA.42.19	or blind as the servant of the 
ISA.42.20	He sees
ISA.42.20	his ears are open, but he does not hear.
ISA.42.21	The 
ISA.42.21	to magnify his law and make it glorious.
ISA.42.22	But this is a people robbed and plundered,
ISA.42.22	they are all of them trapped in holes
ISA.42.22	and hidden in prisons;
ISA.42.22	they have become a prey with none to rescue,
ISA.42.22	a spoil with none to say, “Restore!”
ISA.42.23	Who among you will give ear to this,
ISA.42.23	will attend and listen for the time to come?
ISA.42.24	Who gave up Jacob to the spoiler,
ISA.42.24	and Israel to the robbers?
ISA.42.24	Was it not the 
ISA.42.24	in whose ways they would not walk,
ISA.42.24	and whose law they would not obey?
ISA.42.25	So he poured upon him the heat of his anger
ISA.42.25	and the might of battle;
ISA.42.25	it set him on fire round about, but he did not understand;
ISA.42.25	it burned him, but he did not take it to heart.
ISA.43.1	But now thus says the 
ISA.43.1	he who created you, O Jacob,
ISA.43.1	he who formed you, O Israel:
ISA.43.1	“Fear not, for I have redeemed you;
ISA.43.1	I have called you by name, you are mine.
ISA.43.2	When you pass through the waters I will be with you;
ISA.43.2	and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you;
ISA.43.2	when you walk through fire you shall not be burned,
ISA.43.2	and the flame shall not consume you.
ISA.43.3	For I am the 
ISA.43.3	the Holy One of Israel, your Savior.
ISA.43.3	I give Egypt as your ransom,
ISA.43.3	Ethiopia and Seba in exchange for you.
ISA.43.4	Because you are precious in my eyes,
ISA.43.4	and honored, and I love you,
ISA.43.4	I give men in return for you,
ISA.43.4	peoples in exchange for your life.
ISA.43.5	I will bring your offspring from the east,
ISA.43.5	and from the west I will gather you;
ISA.43.6	I will say to the north, Give up,
ISA.43.6	and to the south, Do not withhold;
ISA.43.6	bring my sons from afar
ISA.43.6	and my daughters from the end of the earth,
ISA.43.7	every one who is called by my name,
ISA.43.7	whom I created for my glory,
ISA.43.7	whom I formed and made.”
ISA.43.8	Bring forth the people who are blind, yet have eyes,
ISA.43.8	who are deaf, yet have ears!
ISA.43.9	Let all the nations gather together,
ISA.43.9	and let the peoples assemble.
ISA.43.9	Who among them can declare this,
ISA.43.9	and show us the former things?
ISA.43.9	Let them bring their witnesses to justify them,
ISA.43.9	and let them hear and say, It is true.
ISA.43.10	“You are my witnesses,” says the 
ISA.43.10	“and my servant whom I have chosen,
ISA.43.10	that you may know and believe me
ISA.43.10	and understand that I am He.
ISA.43.10	Before me no god was formed,
ISA.43.10	nor shall there be any after me.
ISA.43.11	I, I am the 
ISA.43.11	and besides me there is no savior.
ISA.43.12	I declared and saved and proclaimed,
ISA.43.12	when there was no strange god among you;
ISA.43.12	and you are my witnesses,” says the 
ISA.43.13	“I am God, and also henceforth I am He;
ISA.43.13	there is none who can deliver from my hand;
ISA.43.13	I work and who can hinder it?”
ISA.43.14	Thus says the 
ISA.43.14	your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:
ISA.43.14	“For your sake I will send to Babylon
ISA.43.14	and break down all the bars,
ISA.43.14	and the shouting of the Chaldeans will be turned to lamentations.
ISA.43.15	I am the 
ISA.43.15	the Creator of Israel, your King.”
ISA.43.16	Thus says the 
ISA.43.16	who makes a way in the sea,
ISA.43.16	a path in the mighty waters,
ISA.43.17	who brings forth chariot and horse,
ISA.43.17	army and warrior;
ISA.43.17	they lie down, they cannot rise,
ISA.43.17	they are extinguished, quenched like a wick:
ISA.43.18	“Remember not the former things,
ISA.43.18	nor consider the things of old.
ISA.43.19	Behold, I am doing a new thing;
ISA.43.19	now it springs forth, do you not perceive it?
ISA.43.19	I will make a way in the wilderness
ISA.43.19	and rivers in the desert.
ISA.43.20	The wild beasts will honor me,
ISA.43.20	the jackals and the ostriches;
ISA.43.20	for I give water in the wilderness,
ISA.43.20	rivers in the desert,
ISA.43.20	to give drink to my chosen people,
ISA.43.21	the people whom I formed for myself
ISA.43.21	that they might declare my praise.
ISA.43.22	“Yet you did not call upon me, O Jacob;
ISA.43.22	but you have been weary of me, O Israel!
ISA.43.23	You have not brought me your sheep for burnt offerings,
ISA.43.23	or honored me with your sacrifices.
ISA.43.23	I have not burdened you with offerings,
ISA.43.23	or wearied you with frankincense.
ISA.43.24	You have not bought me sweet cane with money,
ISA.43.24	or satisfied me with the fat of your sacrifices.
ISA.43.24	But you have burdened me with your sins,
ISA.43.24	you have wearied me with your iniquities.
ISA.43.25	“I, I am He
ISA.43.25	who blots out your transgressions for my own sake,
ISA.43.25	and I will not remember your sins.
ISA.43.26	Put me in remembrance, let us argue together;
ISA.43.26	set forth your case, that you may be proved right.
ISA.43.27	Your first father sinned,
ISA.43.27	and your mediators transgressed against me.
ISA.43.28	Therefore I profaned the princes of the sanctuary,
ISA.43.28	I delivered Jacob to utter destruction
ISA.43.28	and Israel to reviling.
ISA.44.1	“But now hear, O Jacob my servant,
ISA.44.1	Israel whom I have chosen!
ISA.44.2	Thus says the 
ISA.44.2	who formed you from the womb and will help you:
ISA.44.2	Fear not, O Jacob my servant,
ISA.44.2	Jeshurun whom I have chosen.
ISA.44.3	For I will pour water on the thirsty land,
ISA.44.3	and streams on the dry ground;
ISA.44.3	I will pour my Spirit upon your descendants,
ISA.44.3	and my blessing on your offspring.
ISA.44.4	They shall spring up like grass amid waters,
ISA.44.4	like willows by flowing streams.
ISA.44.5	This one will say, ‘I am the 
ISA.44.5	another will call himself by the name of Jacob,
ISA.44.5	and another will write on his hand, ‘The 
ISA.44.5	and surname himself by the name of Israel.”
ISA.44.6	and his Redeemer, the 
ISA.44.6	“I am the first and I am the last;
ISA.44.6	besides me there is no god.
ISA.44.7	Who is like me? Let him proclaim it,
ISA.44.7	let him declare and set it forth before me.
ISA.44.7	Who has announced from of old the things to come?
ISA.44.7	Let them tell us
ISA.44.8	Fear not, nor be afraid;
ISA.44.8	have I not told you from of old and declared it?
ISA.44.8	And you are my witnesses!
ISA.44.8	Is there a God besides me?
ISA.44.8	There is no Rock; I know not any.”
ISA.44.9	All who make idols are nothing, and the things they delight in do not profit; their witnesses neither see nor know, that they may be put to shame. 
ISA.44.10	Who fashions a god or casts an image, that is profitable for nothing? 
ISA.44.11	Behold, all his fellows shall be put to shame, and the craftsmen are but men; let them all assemble, let them stand forth, they shall be terrified, they shall be put to shame together.
ISA.44.12	The ironsmith fashions it
ISA.44.13	The carpenter stretches a line, he marks it out with a pencil; he fashions it with planes, and marks it with a compass; he shapes it into the figure of a man, with the beauty of a man, to dwell in a house. 
ISA.44.14	He cuts down cedars; or he chooses a holm tree or an oak and lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest; he plants a cedar and the rain nourishes it. 
ISA.44.15	Then it becomes fuel for a man; he takes a part of it and warms himself, he kindles a fire and bakes bread; also he makes a god and worships it, he makes it a graven image and falls down before it. 
ISA.44.16	Half of it he burns in the fire; over the half he eats flesh, he roasts meat and is satisfied; also he warms himself and says, “Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire!” 
ISA.44.17	And the rest of it he makes into a god, his idol; and falls down to it and worships it; he prays to it and says, “Deliver me, for thou art my god!”
ISA.44.18	They know not, nor do they discern; for he has shut their eyes, so that they cannot see, and their minds, so that they cannot understand. 
ISA.44.19	No one considers, nor is there knowledge or discernment to say, “Half of it I burned in the fire, I also baked bread on its coals, I roasted flesh and have eaten; and shall I make the residue of it an abomination? Shall I fall down before a block of wood?” 
ISA.44.20	He feeds on ashes; a deluded mind has led him astray, and he cannot deliver himself or say, “Is there not a lie in my right hand?”
ISA.44.21	Remember these things, O Jacob,
ISA.44.21	and Israel, for you are my servant;
ISA.44.21	I formed you, you are my servant;
ISA.44.21	O Israel, you will not be forgotten by me.
ISA.44.22	I have swept away your transgressions like a cloud,
ISA.44.22	and your sins like mist;
ISA.44.22	return to me, for I have redeemed you.
ISA.44.23	shout, O depths of the earth;
ISA.44.23	break forth into singing, O mountains,
ISA.44.23	O forest, and every tree in it!
ISA.44.23	For the 
ISA.44.23	and will be glorified in Israel.
ISA.44.24	Thus says the 
ISA.44.24	who formed you from the womb:
ISA.44.24	“I am the 
ISA.44.24	who stretched out the heavens alone,
ISA.44.24	who spread out the earth—Who was with me?
ISA.44.25	and makes fools of diviners;
ISA.44.25	who turns wise men back,
ISA.44.25	and makes their knowledge foolish;
ISA.44.26	who confirms the word of his servant,
ISA.44.26	and performs the counsel of his messengers;
ISA.44.26	who says of Jerusalem, ‘She shall be inhabited,’
ISA.44.26	and of the cities of Judah, ‘They shall be built,
ISA.44.26	and I will raise up their ruins’;
ISA.44.27	who says to the deep, ‘Be dry,
ISA.44.27	I will dry up your rivers’;
ISA.44.28	who says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd,
ISA.44.28	and he shall fulfil all my purpose’;
ISA.44.28	saying of Jerusalem, ‘She shall be built,’
ISA.44.28	and of the temple, ‘Your foundation shall be laid.’ ”
ISA.45.1	Thus says the 
ISA.45.1	whose right hand I have grasped,
ISA.45.1	to subdue nations before him
ISA.45.1	and ungird the loins of kings,
ISA.45.1	to open doors before him
ISA.45.1	that gates may not be closed:
ISA.45.2	“I will go before you
ISA.45.2	and level the mountains,
ISA.45.2	I will break in pieces the doors of bronze
ISA.45.2	and cut asunder the bars of iron,
ISA.45.3	I will give you the treasures of darkness
ISA.45.3	and the hoards in secret places,
ISA.45.3	that you may know that it is I, the 
ISA.45.3	the God of Israel, who call you by your name.
ISA.45.4	For the sake of my servant Jacob,
ISA.45.4	and Israel my chosen,
ISA.45.4	I call you by your name,
ISA.45.4	I surname you, though you do not know me.
ISA.45.5	I am the 
ISA.45.5	besides me there is no God;
ISA.45.5	I gird you, though you do not know me,
ISA.45.6	that men may know, from the rising of the sun
ISA.45.6	and from the west, that there is none besides me;
ISA.45.6	I am the 
ISA.45.7	I form light and create darkness,
ISA.45.7	I make weal and create woe,
ISA.45.7	I am the 
ISA.45.8	“Shower, O heavens, from above,
ISA.45.8	and let the skies rain down righteousness;
ISA.45.8	let the earth open, that salvation may sprout forth,
ISA.45.8	and let it cause righteousness to spring up also;
ISA.45.8	I the 
ISA.45.9	an earthen vessel with the potter!
ISA.45.9	Does the clay say to him who fashions it, ‘What are you making?’
ISA.45.9	or ‘Your work has no handles’?
ISA.45.10	Woe to him who says to a father, ‘What are you begetting?’
ISA.45.10	or to a woman, ‘With what are you in travail?’ ”
ISA.45.11	Thus says the 
ISA.45.11	the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker:
ISA.45.11	“Will you question me
ISA.45.11	or command me concerning the work of my hands?
ISA.45.12	I made the earth,
ISA.45.12	and created man upon it;
ISA.45.12	it was my hands that stretched out the heavens,
ISA.45.12	and I commanded all their host.
ISA.45.13	I have aroused him in righteousness,
ISA.45.13	and I will make straight all his ways;
ISA.45.13	he shall build my city
ISA.45.13	and set my exiles free,
ISA.45.13	not for price or reward,”
ISA.45.13	says the 
ISA.45.14	“The wealth of Egypt and the merchandise of Ethiopia,
ISA.45.14	and the Sabeans, men of stature,
ISA.45.14	shall come over to you and be yours,
ISA.45.14	they shall follow you;
ISA.45.14	they shall come over in chains and bow down to you.
ISA.45.14	They will make supplication to you, saying:
ISA.45.14	‘God is with you only, and there is no other,
ISA.45.14	no god besides him.’ ”
ISA.45.15	Truly, thou art a God who hidest thyself,
ISA.45.15	O God of Israel, the Savior.
ISA.45.16	All of them are put to shame and confounded,
ISA.45.16	the makers of idols go in confusion together.
ISA.45.17	with everlasting salvation;
ISA.45.17	you shall not be put to shame or confounded
ISA.45.17	to all eternity.
ISA.45.18	For thus says the 
ISA.45.18	who created the heavens
ISA.45.18	(he is God!),
ISA.45.18	who formed the earth and made it
ISA.45.18	(he established it;
ISA.45.18	he did not create it a chaos,
ISA.45.18	he formed it to be inhabited!):
ISA.45.18	“I am the 
ISA.45.19	I did not speak in secret,
ISA.45.19	in a land of darkness;
ISA.45.19	I did not say to the offspring of Jacob,
ISA.45.19	‘Seek me in chaos.’
ISA.45.19	I the 
ISA.45.19	I declare what is right.
ISA.45.20	“Assemble yourselves and come,
ISA.45.20	draw near together,
ISA.45.20	you survivors of the nations!
ISA.45.20	They have no knowledge
ISA.45.20	who carry about their wooden idols,
ISA.45.20	and keep on praying to a god
ISA.45.20	that cannot save.
ISA.45.21	let them take counsel together!
ISA.45.21	Who told this long ago?
ISA.45.21	Who declared it of old?
ISA.45.21	Was it not I, the 
ISA.45.21	And there is no other god besides me,
ISA.45.21	a righteous God and a Savior;
ISA.45.21	there is none besides me.
ISA.45.22	“Turn to me and be saved,
ISA.45.22	all the ends of the earth!
ISA.45.22	For I am God, and there is no other.
ISA.45.23	from my mouth has gone forth in righteousness
ISA.45.23	a word that shall not return:
ISA.45.23	‘To me every knee shall bow,
ISA.45.23	every tongue shall swear.’
ISA.45.24	“Only in the 
ISA.45.24	are righteousness and strength;
ISA.45.24	to him shall come and be ashamed,
ISA.45.24	all who were incensed against him.
ISA.45.25	In the 
ISA.45.25	shall triumph and glory.”
ISA.46.1	Bel bows down, Nebo stoops,
ISA.46.1	their idols are on beasts and cattle;
ISA.46.1	these things you carry are loaded
ISA.46.1	as burdens on weary beasts.
ISA.46.2	They stoop, they bow down together,
ISA.46.2	they cannot save the burden,
ISA.46.2	but themselves go into captivity.
ISA.46.3	“Hearken to me, O house of Jacob,
ISA.46.3	all the remnant of the house of Israel,
ISA.46.3	who have been borne by me from your birth,
ISA.46.3	carried from the womb;
ISA.46.4	even to your old age I am He,
ISA.46.4	and to gray hairs I will carry you.
ISA.46.4	I have made, and I will bear;
ISA.46.4	I will carry and will save.
ISA.46.5	“To whom will you liken me and make me equal,
ISA.46.5	and compare me, that we may be alike?
ISA.46.6	Those who lavish gold from the purse,
ISA.46.6	and weigh out silver in the scales,
ISA.46.6	hire a goldsmith, and he makes it into a god;
ISA.46.6	then they fall down and worship!
ISA.46.7	They lift it upon their shoulders, they carry it,
ISA.46.7	they set it in its place, and it stands there;
ISA.46.7	it cannot move from its place.
ISA.46.7	If one cries to it, it does not answer
ISA.46.7	or save him from his trouble.
ISA.46.8	“Remember this and consider,
ISA.46.8	recall it to mind, you transgressors,
ISA.46.9	remember the former things of old;
ISA.46.9	for I am God, and there is no other;
ISA.46.9	I am God, and there is none like me,
ISA.46.10	declaring the end from the beginning
ISA.46.10	and from ancient times things not yet done,
ISA.46.10	saying, ‘My counsel shall stand,
ISA.46.10	and I will accomplish all my purpose,’
ISA.46.11	calling a bird of prey from the east,
ISA.46.11	the man of my counsel from a far country.
ISA.46.11	I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass;
ISA.46.11	I have purposed, and I will do it.
ISA.46.12	“Hearken to me, you stubborn of heart,
ISA.46.12	you who are far from deliverance:
ISA.46.13	I bring near my deliverance, it is not far off,
ISA.46.13	and my salvation will not tarry;
ISA.46.13	I will put salvation in Zion,
ISA.46.13	for Israel my glory.”
ISA.47.1	O virgin daughter of Babylon;
ISA.47.1	sit on the ground without a throne,
ISA.47.1	O daughter of the Chaldeans!
ISA.47.1	For you shall no more be called
ISA.47.1	tender and delicate.
ISA.47.2	Take the millstones and grind meal,
ISA.47.2	put off your veil,
ISA.47.2	strip off your robe, uncover your legs,
ISA.47.2	pass through the rivers.
ISA.47.3	Your nakedness shall be uncovered,
ISA.47.3	and your shame shall be seen.
ISA.47.3	I will take vengeance,
ISA.47.3	and I will spare no man.
ISA.47.4	Our Redeemer—the 
ISA.47.4	is the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.47.5	Sit in silence, and go into darkness,
ISA.47.5	O daughter of the Chaldeans;
ISA.47.5	for you shall no more be called
ISA.47.5	the mistress of kingdoms.
ISA.47.6	I was angry with my people,
ISA.47.6	I profaned my heritage;
ISA.47.6	I gave them into your hand,
ISA.47.6	you showed them no mercy;
ISA.47.6	on the aged you made your yoke
ISA.47.6	exceedingly heavy.
ISA.47.7	You said, “I shall be mistress for ever,”
ISA.47.7	so that you did not lay these things to heart
ISA.47.7	or remember their end.
ISA.47.8	who sit securely,
ISA.47.8	who say in your heart,
ISA.47.8	“I am, and there is no one besides me;
ISA.47.8	I shall not sit as a widow
ISA.47.8	or know the loss of children”:
ISA.47.9	in a moment, in one day;
ISA.47.9	the loss of children and widowhood
ISA.47.9	shall come upon you in full measure,
ISA.47.9	in spite of your many sorceries
ISA.47.9	and the great power of your enchantments.
ISA.47.10	You felt secure in your wickedness,
ISA.47.10	you said, “No one sees me”;
ISA.47.10	your wisdom and your knowledge
ISA.47.10	led you astray,
ISA.47.10	and you said in your heart,
ISA.47.10	“I am, and there is no one besides me.”
ISA.47.11	But evil shall come upon you,
ISA.47.11	for which you cannot atone;
ISA.47.11	disaster shall fall upon you,
ISA.47.11	which you will not be able to expiate;
ISA.47.11	and ruin shall come on you suddenly,
ISA.47.11	of which you know nothing.
ISA.47.12	Stand fast in your enchantments
ISA.47.12	and your many sorceries,
ISA.47.12	with which you have labored from your youth;
ISA.47.12	perhaps you may be able to succeed,
ISA.47.12	perhaps you may inspire terror.
ISA.47.13	You are wearied with your many counsels;
ISA.47.13	let them stand forth and save you,
ISA.47.13	those who divide the heavens,
ISA.47.13	who gaze at the stars,
ISA.47.13	who at the new moons predict
ISA.47.13	what
ISA.47.14	Behold, they are like stubble,
ISA.47.14	the fire consumes them;
ISA.47.14	they cannot deliver themselves
ISA.47.14	from the power of the flame.
ISA.47.14	No coal for warming oneself is this,
ISA.47.14	no fire to sit before!
ISA.47.15	Such to you are those with whom you have labored,
ISA.47.15	who have trafficked with you from your youth;
ISA.47.15	they wander about each in his own direction;
ISA.47.15	there is no one to save you.
ISA.48.1	Hear this, O house of Jacob,
ISA.48.1	who are called by the name of Israel,
ISA.48.1	and who came forth from the loins
ISA.48.1	who swear by the name of the 
ISA.48.1	and confess the God of Israel,
ISA.48.1	but not in truth or right.
ISA.48.2	For they call themselves after the holy city,
ISA.48.2	and stay themselves on the God of Israel;
ISA.48.2	the 
ISA.48.3	“The former things I declared of old,
ISA.48.3	they went forth from my mouth and I made them known;
ISA.48.3	then suddenly I did them and they came to pass.
ISA.48.4	Because I know that you are obstinate,
ISA.48.4	and your neck is an iron sinew
ISA.48.4	and your forehead brass,
ISA.48.5	I declared them to you from of old,
ISA.48.5	before they came to pass I announced them to you,
ISA.48.5	lest you should say, ‘My idol did them,
ISA.48.5	my graven image and my molten image commanded them.’
ISA.48.6	“You have heard; now see all this;
ISA.48.6	and will you not declare it?
ISA.48.6	From this time forth I make you hear new things,
ISA.48.6	hidden things which you have not known.
ISA.48.7	They are created now, not long ago;
ISA.48.7	before today you have never heard of them,
ISA.48.7	lest you should say, ‘Behold, I knew them.’
ISA.48.8	You have never heard, you have never known,
ISA.48.8	from of old your ear has not been opened.
ISA.48.8	For I knew that you would deal very treacherously,
ISA.48.8	and that from birth you were called a rebel.
ISA.48.9	“For my name's sake I defer my anger,
ISA.48.9	for the sake of my praise I restrain it for you,
ISA.48.9	that I may not cut you off.
ISA.48.10	Behold, I have refined you, but not like
ISA.48.10	I have tried you in the furnace of affliction.
ISA.48.11	For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it,
ISA.48.11	for how should my name
ISA.48.11	My glory I will not give to another.
ISA.48.12	and Israel, whom I called!
ISA.48.12	I am He, I am the first,
ISA.48.12	and I am the last.
ISA.48.13	My hand laid the foundation of the earth,
ISA.48.13	and my right hand spread out the heavens;
ISA.48.13	when I call to them,
ISA.48.13	they stand forth together.
ISA.48.14	“Assemble, all of you, and hear!
ISA.48.14	Who among them has declared these things?
ISA.48.14	The 
ISA.48.14	he shall perform his purpose on Babylon,
ISA.48.14	and his arm shall be against the Chaldeans.
ISA.48.15	I, even I, have spoken and called him,
ISA.48.15	I have brought him, and he will prosper in his way.
ISA.48.16	Draw near to me, hear this:
ISA.48.16	from the beginning I have not spoken in secret,
ISA.48.16	from the time it came to be I have been there.”
ISA.48.16	And now the Lord 
ISA.48.17	Thus says the 
ISA.48.17	your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:
ISA.48.17	“I am the 
ISA.48.17	who teaches you to profit,
ISA.48.17	who leads you in the way you should go.
ISA.48.18	O that you had hearkened to my commandments!
ISA.48.18	Then your peace would have been like a river,
ISA.48.18	and your righteousness like the waves of the sea;
ISA.48.19	your offspring would have been like the sand,
ISA.48.19	and your descendants like its grains;
ISA.48.19	their name would never be cut off
ISA.48.19	or destroyed from before me.”
ISA.48.20	Go forth from Babylon, flee from Chaldea,
ISA.48.20	declare this with a shout of joy, proclaim it,
ISA.48.20	send it forth to the end of the earth;
ISA.48.20	say, “The 
ISA.48.21	They thirsted not when he led them through the deserts;
ISA.48.21	he made water flow for them from the rock;
ISA.48.21	he cleft the rock and the water gushed out.
ISA.48.22	“There is no peace,” says the 
ISA.49.1	and hearken, you peoples from afar.
ISA.49.1	The 
ISA.49.1	from the body of my mother he named my name.
ISA.49.2	He made my mouth like a sharp sword,
ISA.49.2	in the shadow of his hand he hid me;
ISA.49.2	he made me a polished arrow,
ISA.49.2	in his quiver he hid me away.
ISA.49.3	And he said to me, “You are my servant,
ISA.49.3	Israel, in whom I will be glorified.”
ISA.49.4	I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;
ISA.49.4	yet surely my right is with the 
ISA.49.4	and my recompense with my God.”
ISA.49.5	And now the 
ISA.49.5	who formed me from the womb to be his servant,
ISA.49.5	to bring Jacob back to him,
ISA.49.5	and that Israel might be gathered to him,
ISA.49.5	for I am honored in the eyes of the 
ISA.49.5	and my God has become my strength—
ISA.49.6	“It is too light a thing that you should be my servant
ISA.49.6	to raise up the tribes of Jacob
ISA.49.6	and to restore the preserved of Israel;
ISA.49.6	I will give you as a light to the nations,
ISA.49.6	that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.”
ISA.49.7	Thus says the 
ISA.49.7	the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One,
ISA.49.7	to one deeply despised, abhorred by the nations,
ISA.49.7	the servant of rulers:
ISA.49.7	“Kings shall see and arise;
ISA.49.7	princes, and they shall prostrate themselves;
ISA.49.7	because of the 
ISA.49.7	the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”
ISA.49.8	“In a time of favor I have answered you,
ISA.49.8	in a day of salvation I have helped you;
ISA.49.8	I have kept you and given you
ISA.49.8	as a covenant to the people,
ISA.49.8	to establish the land,
ISA.49.8	to apportion the desolate heritages;
ISA.49.9	saying to the prisoners, ‘Come forth,’
ISA.49.9	to those who are in darkness, ‘Appear.’
ISA.49.9	They shall feed along the ways,
ISA.49.9	on all bare heights shall be their pasture;
ISA.49.10	neither scorching wind nor sun shall smite them,
ISA.49.10	for he who has pity on them will lead them,
ISA.49.10	and by springs of water will guide them.
ISA.49.11	And I will make all my mountains a way,
ISA.49.11	and my highways shall be raised up.
ISA.49.12	Lo, these shall come from afar,
ISA.49.12	and lo, these from the north and from the west,
ISA.49.12	and these from the land of Syene.”
ISA.49.13	break forth, O mountains, into singing!
ISA.49.13	For the 
ISA.49.13	and will have compassion on his afflicted.
ISA.49.14	But Zion said, “The 
ISA.49.14	my Lord has forgotten me.”
ISA.49.15	“Can a woman forget her sucking child,
ISA.49.15	that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb?
ISA.49.15	Even these may forget,
ISA.49.15	yet I will not forget you.
ISA.49.16	Behold, I have graven you on the palms of my hands;
ISA.49.16	your walls are continually before me.
ISA.49.17	Your builders outstrip your destroyers,
ISA.49.17	and those who laid you waste go forth from you.
ISA.49.18	Lift up your eyes round about and see;
ISA.49.18	they all gather, they come to you.
ISA.49.18	As I live, says the 
ISA.49.18	you shall put them all on as an ornament,
ISA.49.18	you shall bind them on as a bride does.
ISA.49.19	“Surely your waste and your desolate places
ISA.49.19	and your devastated land—
ISA.49.19	surely now you will be too narrow for your inhabitants,
ISA.49.19	and those who swallowed you up will be far away.
ISA.49.20	The children born in the time of your bereavement
ISA.49.20	will yet say in your ears:
ISA.49.20	‘The place is too narrow for me;
ISA.49.20	make room for me to dwell in.’
ISA.49.21	Then you will say in your heart:
ISA.49.21	‘Who has borne me these?
ISA.49.21	I was bereaved and barren,
ISA.49.21	exiled and put away,
ISA.49.21	but who has brought up these?
ISA.49.21	Behold, I was left alone;
ISA.49.21	whence then have these come?’ ”
ISA.49.22	Thus says the Lord 
ISA.49.22	“Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations,
ISA.49.22	and raise my signal to the peoples;
ISA.49.22	and they shall bring your sons in their bosom,
ISA.49.22	and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.
ISA.49.23	Kings shall be your foster fathers,
ISA.49.23	and their queens your nursing mothers.
ISA.49.23	With their faces to the ground they shall bow down to you,
ISA.49.23	and lick the dust of your feet.
ISA.49.23	Then you will know that I am the 
ISA.49.23	those who wait for me shall not be put to shame.”
ISA.49.24	Can the prey be taken from the mighty,
ISA.49.24	or the captives of a tyrant
ISA.49.25	Surely, thus says the 
ISA.49.25	“Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken,
ISA.49.25	and the prey of the tyrant be rescued,
ISA.49.25	for I will contend with those who contend with you,
ISA.49.25	and I will save your children.
ISA.49.26	I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh,
ISA.49.26	and they shall be drunk with their own blood as with wine.
ISA.49.26	Then all flesh shall know
ISA.49.26	that I am the 
ISA.49.26	and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”
ISA.50.1	Thus says the 
ISA.50.1	“Where is your mother's bill of divorce,
ISA.50.1	with which I put her away?
ISA.50.1	Or which of my creditors is it
ISA.50.1	to whom I have sold you?
ISA.50.1	Behold, for your iniquities you were sold,
ISA.50.1	and for your transgressions your mother was put away.
ISA.50.2	Why, when I came, was there no man?
ISA.50.2	When I called, was there no one to answer?
ISA.50.2	Is my hand shortened, that it cannot redeem?
ISA.50.2	Or have I no power to deliver?
ISA.50.2	Behold, by my rebuke I dry up the sea,
ISA.50.2	I make the rivers a desert;
ISA.50.2	their fish stink for lack of water,
ISA.50.2	and die of thirst.
ISA.50.3	I clothe the heavens with blackness,
ISA.50.3	and make sackcloth their covering.”
ISA.50.4	The Lord 
ISA.50.4	the tongue of those who are taught,
ISA.50.4	that I may know how to sustain with a word
ISA.50.4	him that is weary.
ISA.50.4	Morning by morning he wakens,
ISA.50.4	he wakens my ear
ISA.50.4	to hear as those who are taught.
ISA.50.5	The Lord 
ISA.50.5	and I was not rebellious,
ISA.50.5	I turned not backward.
ISA.50.6	I gave my back to the smiters,
ISA.50.6	and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard;
ISA.50.6	I hid not my face
ISA.50.6	from shame and spitting.
ISA.50.7	For the Lord 
ISA.50.7	therefore I have not been confounded;
ISA.50.7	therefore I have set my face like a flint,
ISA.50.7	and I know that I shall not be put to shame;
ISA.50.8	Who will contend with me?
ISA.50.8	Let us stand up together.
ISA.50.8	Who is my adversary?
ISA.50.8	Let him come near to me.
ISA.50.9	Behold, the Lord 
ISA.50.9	who will declare me guilty?
ISA.50.9	Behold, all of them will wear out like a garment;
ISA.50.9	the moth will eat them up.
ISA.50.10	Who among you fears the 
ISA.50.10	and obeys the voice of his servant,
ISA.50.10	who walks in darkness
ISA.50.10	and has no light,
ISA.50.10	yet trusts in the name of the 
ISA.50.10	and relies upon his God?
ISA.50.11	Behold, all you who kindle a fire,
ISA.50.11	who set brands alight!
ISA.50.11	Walk by the light of your fire,
ISA.50.11	and by the brands which you have kindled!
ISA.50.11	This shall you have from my hand:
ISA.50.11	you shall lie down in torment.
ISA.51.1	“Hearken to me, you who pursue deliverance,
ISA.51.1	you who seek the 
ISA.51.1	look to the rock from which you were hewn,
ISA.51.1	and to the quarry from which you were digged.
ISA.51.2	Look to Abraham your father
ISA.51.2	and to Sarah who bore you;
ISA.51.2	for when he was but one I called him,
ISA.51.2	and I blessed him and made him many.
ISA.51.3	For the 
ISA.51.3	he will comfort all her waste places,
ISA.51.3	and will make her wilderness like Eden,
ISA.51.3	her desert like the garden of the 
ISA.51.3	joy and gladness will be found in her,
ISA.51.3	thanksgiving and the voice of song.
ISA.51.4	“Listen to me, my people,
ISA.51.4	and give ear to me, my nation;
ISA.51.4	for a law will go forth from me,
ISA.51.4	and my justice for a light to the peoples.
ISA.51.5	My deliverance draws near speedily,
ISA.51.5	my salvation has gone forth,
ISA.51.5	and my arms will rule the peoples;
ISA.51.5	the coastlands wait for me,
ISA.51.5	and for my arm they hope.
ISA.51.6	and look at the earth beneath;
ISA.51.6	for the heavens will vanish like smoke,
ISA.51.6	the earth will wear out like a garment,
ISA.51.6	and they who dwell in it will die like gnats;
ISA.51.6	but my salvation will be for ever,
ISA.51.6	and my deliverance will never be ended.
ISA.51.7	“Hearken to me, you who know righteousness,
ISA.51.7	the people in whose heart is my law;
ISA.51.7	fear not the reproach of men,
ISA.51.7	and be not dismayed at their revilings.
ISA.51.8	For the moth will eat them up like a garment,
ISA.51.8	and the worm will eat them like wool;
ISA.51.8	but my deliverance will be for ever,
ISA.51.8	and my salvation to all generations.”
ISA.51.9	Awake, awake, put on strength,
ISA.51.9	O arm of the 
ISA.51.9	awake, as in days of old,
ISA.51.9	the generations of long ago.
ISA.51.9	Was it not thou that didst cut Rahab in pieces,
ISA.51.9	that didst pierce the dragon?
ISA.51.10	Was it not thou that didst dry up the sea,
ISA.51.10	the waters of the great deep;
ISA.51.10	that didst make the depths of the sea a way
ISA.51.10	for the redeemed to pass over?
ISA.51.11	And the ransomed of the 
ISA.51.11	and come to Zion with singing;
ISA.51.11	everlasting joy shall be upon their heads;
ISA.51.11	they shall obtain joy and gladness,
ISA.51.11	and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
ISA.51.12	“I, I am he that comforts you;
ISA.51.12	who are you that you are afraid of man who dies,
ISA.51.12	of the son of man who is made like grass,
ISA.51.13	and have forgotten the 
ISA.51.13	who stretched out the heavens
ISA.51.13	and laid the foundations of the earth,
ISA.51.13	and fear continually all the day
ISA.51.13	because of the fury of the oppressor,
ISA.51.13	when he sets himself to destroy?
ISA.51.13	And where is the fury of the oppressor?
ISA.51.14	He who is bowed down shall speedily be released;
ISA.51.14	he shall not die and go down to the Pit,
ISA.51.14	neither shall his bread fail.
ISA.51.15	For I am the 
ISA.51.15	who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar—
ISA.51.15	the 
ISA.51.16	And I have put my words in your mouth,
ISA.51.16	and hid you in the shadow of my hand,
ISA.51.16	stretching out
ISA.51.16	and laying the foundations of the earth,
ISA.51.16	and saying to Zion, ‘You are my people.’ ”
ISA.51.17	Rouse yourself, rouse yourself,
ISA.51.17	stand up, O Jerusalem,
ISA.51.17	you who have drunk at the hand of the 
ISA.51.17	the cup of his wrath,
ISA.51.17	who have drunk to the dregs
ISA.51.17	the bowl of staggering.
ISA.51.18	There is none to guide her
ISA.51.18	among all the sons she has borne;
ISA.51.18	there is none to take her by the hand
ISA.51.18	among all the sons she has brought up.
ISA.51.19	These two things have befallen you—
ISA.51.19	who will condole with you?—
ISA.51.19	devastation and destruction, famine and sword;
ISA.51.19	who will comfort you?
ISA.51.20	Your sons have fainted,
ISA.51.20	they lie at the head of every street
ISA.51.20	like an antelope in a net;
ISA.51.20	they are full of the wrath of the 
ISA.51.20	the rebuke of your God.
ISA.51.21	Therefore hear this, you who are afflicted,
ISA.51.21	who are drunk, but not with wine:
ISA.51.22	Thus says your Lord, the 
ISA.51.22	your God who pleads the cause of his people:
ISA.51.22	“Behold, I have taken from your hand
ISA.51.22	the cup of staggering;
ISA.51.22	the bowl of my wrath
ISA.51.22	you shall drink no more;
ISA.51.23	and I will put it into the hand of your tormentors,
ISA.51.23	who have said to you,
ISA.51.23	‘Bow down, that we may pass over’;
ISA.51.23	and you have made your back like the ground
ISA.51.23	and like the street for them to pass over.”
ISA.52.1	put on your strength, O Zion;
ISA.52.1	put on your beautiful garments,
ISA.52.1	O Jerusalem, the holy city;
ISA.52.1	for there shall no more come into you
ISA.52.1	the uncircumcised and the unclean.
ISA.52.2	Shake yourself from the dust, arise,
ISA.52.2	O captive
ISA.52.2	loose the bonds from your neck,
ISA.52.2	O captive daughter of Zion.
ISA.52.3	For thus says the 
ISA.52.4	For thus says the Lord 
ISA.52.5	 Now therefore what have I here, says the 
ISA.52.6	Therefore my people shall know my name; therefore in that day they shall know that it is I who speak; here am I.”
ISA.52.7	are the feet of him who brings good tidings,
ISA.52.7	who publishes peace, who brings good tidings of good,
ISA.52.7	who publishes salvation,
ISA.52.7	who says to Zion, “Your God reigns.”
ISA.52.8	Hark, your watchmen lift up their voice,
ISA.52.8	together they sing for joy;
ISA.52.8	for eye to eye they see
ISA.52.8	the return of the 
ISA.52.9	Break forth together into singing,
ISA.52.9	you waste places of Jerusalem;
ISA.52.9	for the 
ISA.52.9	he has redeemed Jerusalem.
ISA.52.10	before the eyes of all the nations;
ISA.52.10	and all the ends of the earth shall see
ISA.52.10	the salvation of our God.
ISA.52.11	touch no unclean thing;
ISA.52.11	go out from the midst of her, purify yourselves,
ISA.52.11	you who bear the vessels of the 
ISA.52.12	For you shall not go out in haste,
ISA.52.12	and you shall not go in flight,
ISA.52.12	for the 
ISA.52.12	and the God of Israel will be your rear guard.
ISA.52.13	Behold, my servant shall prosper,
ISA.52.13	he shall be exalted and lifted up,
ISA.52.13	and shall be very high.
ISA.52.14	As many were astonished at him
ISA.52.14	his appearance was so marred, beyond human semblance,
ISA.52.14	and his form beyond that of the sons of men—
ISA.52.15	kings shall shut their mouths because of him;
ISA.52.15	for that which has not been told them they shall see,
ISA.52.15	and that which they have not heard they shall understand.
ISA.53.1	And to whom has the arm of the 
ISA.53.2	For he grew up before him like a young plant,
ISA.53.2	and like a root out of dry ground;
ISA.53.2	he had no form or comeliness that we should look at him,
ISA.53.2	and no beauty that we should desire him.
ISA.53.3	He was despised and rejected
ISA.53.3	a man of sorrows,
ISA.53.3	and as one from whom men hide their faces
ISA.53.3	he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
ISA.53.4	and carried our sorrows;
ISA.53.4	yet we esteemed him stricken,
ISA.53.4	smitten by God, and afflicted.
ISA.53.5	he was bruised for our iniquities;
ISA.53.5	upon him was the chastisement that made us whole,
ISA.53.5	and with his stripes we are healed.
ISA.53.6	All we like sheep have gone astray;
ISA.53.6	we have turned every one to his own way;
ISA.53.6	and the 
ISA.53.6	the iniquity of us all.
ISA.53.7	yet he opened not his mouth;
ISA.53.7	like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,
ISA.53.7	and like a sheep that before its shearers is dumb,
ISA.53.7	so he opened not his mouth.
ISA.53.8	By oppression and judgment he was taken away;
ISA.53.8	and as for his generation, who considered
ISA.53.8	that he was cut off out of the land of the living,
ISA.53.8	stricken for the transgression of my people?
ISA.53.9	and with a rich man in his death,
ISA.53.9	although he had done no violence,
ISA.53.9	and there was no deceit in his mouth.
ISA.53.10	Yet it was the will of the 
ISA.53.10	he has put him to grief;
ISA.53.10	when he makes himself
ISA.53.10	he shall see his offspring, he shall prolong his days;
ISA.53.10	the will of the 
ISA.53.11	he shall see the fruit of the travail of his soul and be satisfied;
ISA.53.11	by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant,
ISA.53.11	make many to be accounted righteous;
ISA.53.11	and he shall bear their iniquities.
ISA.53.12	and he shall divide the spoil with the strong;
ISA.53.12	because he poured out his soul to death,
ISA.53.12	and was numbered with the transgressors;
ISA.53.12	yet he bore the sin of many,
ISA.53.12	and made intercession for the transgressors.
ISA.54.1	break forth into singing and cry aloud,
ISA.54.1	you who have not been in travail!
ISA.54.1	For the children of the desolate one will be more
ISA.54.1	than the children of her that is married, says the 
ISA.54.2	Enlarge the place of your tent,
ISA.54.2	and let the curtains of your habitations be stretched out;
ISA.54.2	hold not back, lengthen your cords
ISA.54.2	and strengthen your stakes.
ISA.54.3	For you will spread abroad to the right and to the left,
ISA.54.3	and your descendants will possess the nations
ISA.54.3	and will people the desolate cities.
ISA.54.4	“Fear not, for you will not be ashamed;
ISA.54.4	be not confounded, for you will not be put to shame;
ISA.54.4	for you will forget the shame of your youth,
ISA.54.4	and the reproach of your widowhood you will remember no more.
ISA.54.5	For your Maker is your husband,
ISA.54.5	the 
ISA.54.5	and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer,
ISA.54.5	the God of the whole earth he is called.
ISA.54.6	For the 
ISA.54.6	like a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit,
ISA.54.6	like a wife of youth when she is cast off,
ISA.54.6	says your God.
ISA.54.7	For a brief moment I forsook you,
ISA.54.7	but with great compassion I will gather you.
ISA.54.8	In overflowing wrath for a moment
ISA.54.8	I hid my face from you,
ISA.54.8	but with everlasting love I will have compassion on you,
ISA.54.8	says the 
ISA.54.9	“For this is like the days of Noah to me:
ISA.54.9	as I swore that the waters of Noah
ISA.54.9	should no more go over the earth,
ISA.54.9	so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you
ISA.54.9	and will not rebuke you.
ISA.54.10	For the mountains may depart
ISA.54.10	and the hills be removed,
ISA.54.10	but my steadfast love shall not depart from you,
ISA.54.10	and my covenant of peace shall not be removed,
ISA.54.10	says the 
ISA.54.11	behold, I will set your stones in antimony,
ISA.54.11	and lay your foundations with sapphires.
ISA.54.12	I will make your pinnacles of agate,
ISA.54.12	your gates of carbuncles,
ISA.54.12	and all your wall of precious stones.
ISA.54.13	and great shall be the prosperity of your sons.
ISA.54.14	In righteousness you shall be established;
ISA.54.14	you shall be far from oppression, for you shall not fear;
ISA.54.14	and from terror, for it shall not come near you.
ISA.54.15	If any one stirs up strife,
ISA.54.15	it is not from me;
ISA.54.15	whoever stirs up strife with you
ISA.54.15	shall fall because of you.
ISA.54.16	Behold, I have created the smith
ISA.54.16	who blows the fire of coals,
ISA.54.16	and produces a weapon for its purpose.
ISA.54.16	I have also created the ravager to destroy;
ISA.54.17	no weapon that is fashioned against you shall prosper,
ISA.54.17	and you shall confute every tongue that rises against you in judgment.
ISA.54.17	This is the heritage of the servants of the 
ISA.54.17	and their vindication from me, says the 
ISA.55.1	come to the waters;
ISA.55.1	and he who has no money,
ISA.55.1	come, buy and eat!
ISA.55.1	Come, buy wine and milk
ISA.55.1	without money and without price.
ISA.55.2	Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread,
ISA.55.2	and your labor for that which does not satisfy?
ISA.55.2	Hearken diligently to me, and eat what is good,
ISA.55.2	and delight yourselves in fatness.
ISA.55.3	hear, that your soul may live;
ISA.55.3	and I will make with you an everlasting covenant,
ISA.55.3	my steadfast, sure love for David.
ISA.55.4	Behold, I made him a witness to the peoples,
ISA.55.4	a leader and commander for the peoples.
ISA.55.5	Behold, you shall call nations that you know not,
ISA.55.5	and nations that knew you not shall run to you,
ISA.55.5	because of the 
ISA.55.5	for he has glorified you.
ISA.55.6	“Seek the 
ISA.55.6	call upon him while he is near;
ISA.55.7	let the wicked forsake his way,
ISA.55.7	and the unrighteous man his thoughts;
ISA.55.7	let him return to the 
ISA.55.7	and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
ISA.55.8	For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
ISA.55.8	neither are your ways my ways, says the 
ISA.55.9	For as the heavens are higher than the earth,
ISA.55.9	so are my ways higher than your ways
ISA.55.9	and my thoughts than your thoughts.
ISA.55.10	and return not thither but water the earth,
ISA.55.10	making it bring forth and sprout,
ISA.55.10	giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater,
ISA.55.11	so shall my word be that goes forth from my mouth;
ISA.55.11	it shall not return to me empty,
ISA.55.11	but it shall accomplish that which I purpose,
ISA.55.11	and prosper in the thing for which I sent it.
ISA.55.12	“For you shall go out in joy,
ISA.55.12	and be led forth in peace;
ISA.55.12	the mountains and the hills before you
ISA.55.12	shall break forth into singing,
ISA.55.12	and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.
ISA.55.13	Instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress;
ISA.55.13	instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle;
ISA.55.13	and it shall be to the 
ISA.55.13	for an everlasting sign which shall not be cut off.”
ISA.56.1	Thus says the 
ISA.56.1	“Keep justice, and do righteousness,
ISA.56.1	for soon my salvation will come,
ISA.56.1	and my deliverance be revealed.
ISA.56.2	Blessed is the man who does this,
ISA.56.2	and the son of man who holds it fast,
ISA.56.2	who keeps the sabbath, not profaning it,
ISA.56.2	and keeps his hand from doing any evil.”
ISA.56.3	Let not the foreigner who has joined himself to the 
ISA.56.3	“The 
ISA.56.3	and let not the eunuch say,
ISA.56.3	“Behold, I am a dry tree.”
ISA.56.4	For thus says the 
ISA.56.4	“To the eunuchs who keep my sabbaths,
ISA.56.4	who choose the things that please me
ISA.56.4	and hold fast my covenant,
ISA.56.5	I will give in my house and within my walls
ISA.56.5	a monument and a name
ISA.56.5	better than sons and daughters;
ISA.56.5	I will give them an everlasting name
ISA.56.5	which shall not be cut off.
ISA.56.6	“And the foreigners who join themselves to the 
ISA.56.6	to minister to him, to love the name of the 
ISA.56.6	and to be his servants,
ISA.56.6	every one who keeps the sabbath, and does not profane it,
ISA.56.6	and holds fast my covenant—
ISA.56.7	and make them joyful in my house of prayer;
ISA.56.7	their burnt offerings and their sacrifices
ISA.56.7	will be accepted on my altar;
ISA.56.7	for my house shall be called a house of prayer
ISA.56.7	for all peoples.
ISA.56.8	Thus says the Lord 
ISA.56.8	who gathers the outcasts of Israel,
ISA.56.8	I will gather yet others to him
ISA.56.8	besides those already gathered.”
ISA.56.9	All you beasts of the field, come to devour—
ISA.56.9	all you beasts in the forest.
ISA.56.10	His watchmen are blind,
ISA.56.10	they are all without knowledge;
ISA.56.10	they are all dumb dogs,
ISA.56.10	they cannot bark;
ISA.56.10	dreaming, lying down,
ISA.56.10	loving to slumber.
ISA.56.11	The dogs have a mighty appetite;
ISA.56.11	they never have enough.
ISA.56.11	The shepherds also have no understanding;
ISA.56.11	they have all turned to their own way,
ISA.56.11	each to his own gain, one and all.
ISA.56.12	“Come,” they say, “let us
ISA.56.12	let us fill ourselves with strong drink;
ISA.56.12	and tomorrow will be like this day,
ISA.56.12	great beyond measure.”
ISA.57.1	The righteous man perishes,
ISA.57.1	and no one lays it to heart;
ISA.57.1	devout men are taken away,
ISA.57.1	while no one understands.
ISA.57.1	For the righteous man is taken away from calamity,
ISA.57.2	he enters into peace;
ISA.57.2	they rest in their beds
ISA.57.2	who walk in their uprightness.
ISA.57.3	But you, draw near hither,
ISA.57.3	sons of the sorceress,
ISA.57.3	offspring of the adulterer and the harlot.
ISA.57.4	Of whom are you making sport?
ISA.57.4	Against whom do you open your mouth wide
ISA.57.4	and put out your tongue?
ISA.57.4	Are you not children of transgression,
ISA.57.4	the offspring of deceit,
ISA.57.5	you who burn with lust among the oaks,
ISA.57.5	under every green tree;
ISA.57.5	who slay your children in the valleys,
ISA.57.5	under the clefts of the rocks?
ISA.57.6	Among the smooth stones of the valley is your portion;
ISA.57.6	they, they, are your lot;
ISA.57.6	to them you have poured out a drink offering,
ISA.57.6	you have brought a cereal offering.
ISA.57.6	Shall I be appeased for these things?
ISA.57.7	Upon a high and lofty mountain
ISA.57.7	you have set your bed,
ISA.57.7	and thither you went up to offer sacrifice.
ISA.57.8	Behind the door and the doorpost
ISA.57.8	you have set up your symbol;
ISA.57.8	for, deserting me, you have uncovered your bed,
ISA.57.8	you have gone up to it,
ISA.57.8	you have made it wide;
ISA.57.8	and you have made a bargain for yourself with them,
ISA.57.8	you have loved their bed,
ISA.57.8	you have looked on nakedness.
ISA.57.9	You journeyed to Molech
ISA.57.9	and multiplied your perfumes;
ISA.57.9	you sent your envoys far off,
ISA.57.9	and sent down even to Sheol.
ISA.57.10	You were wearied with the length of your way,
ISA.57.10	but you did not say, “It is hopeless”;
ISA.57.10	you found new life for your strength,
ISA.57.10	and so you were not faint.
ISA.57.11	Whom did you dread and fear,
ISA.57.11	so that you lied,
ISA.57.11	and did not remember me,
ISA.57.11	did not give me a thought?
ISA.57.11	Have I not held my peace, even for a long time,
ISA.57.11	and so you do not fear me?
ISA.57.12	I will tell of your righteousness and your doings,
ISA.57.12	but they will not help you.
ISA.57.13	When you cry out, let your collection of idols deliver you!
ISA.57.13	The wind will carry them off,
ISA.57.13	a breath will take them away.
ISA.57.13	But he who takes refuge in me shall possess the land,
ISA.57.13	and shall inherit my holy mountain.
ISA.57.14	And it shall be said,
ISA.57.14	“Build up, build up, prepare the way,
ISA.57.14	remove every obstruction from my people's way.”
ISA.57.15	who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy:
ISA.57.15	“I dwell in the high and holy place,
ISA.57.15	and also with him who is of a contrite and humble spirit,
ISA.57.15	to revive the spirit of the humble,
ISA.57.15	and to revive the heart of the contrite.
ISA.57.16	For I will not contend for ever,
ISA.57.16	nor will I always be angry;
ISA.57.16	for from me proceeds the spirit,
ISA.57.16	and I have made the breath of life.
ISA.57.17	Because of the iniquity of his covetousness I was angry,
ISA.57.17	I smote him, I hid my face and was angry;
ISA.57.17	but he went on backsliding in the way of his own heart.
ISA.57.18	I have seen his ways, but I will heal him;
ISA.57.18	I will lead him and requite him with comfort,
ISA.57.18	creating for his mourners the fruit of the lips.
ISA.57.19	and I will heal him.
ISA.57.20	But the wicked are like the tossing sea;
ISA.57.20	for it cannot rest,
ISA.57.20	and its waters toss up mire and dirt.
ISA.57.21	There is no peace, says my God, for the wicked.”
ISA.58.1	“Cry aloud, spare not,
ISA.58.1	lift up your voice like a trumpet;
ISA.58.1	declare to my people their transgression,
ISA.58.1	to the house of Jacob their sins.
ISA.58.2	Yet they seek me daily,
ISA.58.2	and delight to know my ways,
ISA.58.2	as if they were a nation that did righteousness
ISA.58.2	and did not forsake the ordinance of their God;
ISA.58.2	they ask of me righteous judgments,
ISA.58.2	they delight to draw near to God.
ISA.58.3	‘Why have we fasted, and thou seest it not?
ISA.58.3	Why have we humbled ourselves, and thou takest no knowledge of it?’
ISA.58.3	Behold, in the day of your fast you seek your own pleasure,
ISA.58.3	and oppress all your workers.
ISA.58.4	Behold, you fast only to quarrel and to fight
ISA.58.4	and to hit with wicked fist.
ISA.58.4	Fasting like yours this day
ISA.58.4	will not make your voice to be heard on high.
ISA.58.5	Is such the fast that I choose,
ISA.58.5	a day for a man to humble himself?
ISA.58.5	Is it to bow down his head like a rush,
ISA.58.5	and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him?
ISA.58.5	Will you call this a fast,
ISA.58.5	and a day acceptable to the 
ISA.58.6	to loose the bonds of wickedness,
ISA.58.6	to undo the thongs of the yoke,
ISA.58.6	to let the oppressed go free,
ISA.58.6	and to break every yoke?
ISA.58.7	Is it not to share your bread with the hungry,
ISA.58.7	and bring the homeless poor into your house;
ISA.58.7	when you see the naked, to cover him,
ISA.58.7	and not to hide yourself from your own flesh?
ISA.58.8	Then shall your light break forth like the dawn,
ISA.58.8	and your healing shall spring up speedily;
ISA.58.8	your righteousness shall go before you,
ISA.58.8	the glory of the 
ISA.58.9	Then you shall call, and the 
ISA.58.9	you shall cry, and he will say, Here I am.
ISA.58.9	“If you take away from the midst of you the yoke,
ISA.58.9	the pointing of the finger, and speaking wickedness,
ISA.58.10	if you pour yourself out for the hungry
ISA.58.10	and satisfy the desire of the afflicted,
ISA.58.10	then shall your light rise in the darkness
ISA.58.10	and your gloom be as the noonday.
ISA.58.11	And the 
ISA.58.11	and satisfy your desire with good things,
ISA.58.11	and make your bones strong;
ISA.58.11	and you shall be like a watered garden,
ISA.58.11	like a spring of water,
ISA.58.11	whose waters fail not.
ISA.58.12	And your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt;
ISA.58.12	you shall raise up the foundations of many generations;
ISA.58.12	you shall be called the repairer of the breach,
ISA.58.12	the restorer of streets to dwell in.
ISA.58.13	“If you turn back your foot from the sabbath,
ISA.58.13	from doing your pleasure
ISA.58.13	and call the sabbath a delight
ISA.58.13	and the holy day of the 
ISA.58.13	if you honor it, not going your own ways,
ISA.58.13	or seeking your own pleasure,
ISA.58.14	then you shall take delight in the 
ISA.58.14	and I will make you ride upon the heights of the earth;
ISA.58.14	I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father,
ISA.58.14	for the mouth of the 
ISA.59.1	Behold, the 
ISA.59.1	or his ear dull, that it cannot hear;
ISA.59.2	but your iniquities have made a separation
ISA.59.2	between you and your God,
ISA.59.2	and your sins have hid his face from you
ISA.59.2	so that he does not hear.
ISA.59.3	For your hands are defiled with blood
ISA.59.3	and your fingers with iniquity;
ISA.59.3	your lips have spoken lies,
ISA.59.3	your tongue mutters wickedness.
ISA.59.4	No one enters suit justly,
ISA.59.4	no one goes to law honestly;
ISA.59.4	they rely on empty pleas, they speak lies,
ISA.59.4	they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity.
ISA.59.5	They hatch adders' eggs,
ISA.59.5	they weave the spider's web;
ISA.59.5	he who eats their eggs dies,
ISA.59.5	and from one which is crushed a viper is hatched.
ISA.59.6	Their webs will not serve as clothing;
ISA.59.6	men will not cover themselves with what they make.
ISA.59.6	Their works are works of iniquity,
ISA.59.6	and deeds of violence are in their hands.
ISA.59.7	and they make haste to shed innocent blood;
ISA.59.7	their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity,
ISA.59.7	desolation and destruction are in their highways.
ISA.59.8	The way of peace they know not,
ISA.59.8	and there is no justice in their paths;
ISA.59.8	they have made their roads crooked,
ISA.59.8	no one who goes in them knows peace.
ISA.59.9	Therefore justice is far from us,
ISA.59.9	and righteousness does not overtake us;
ISA.59.9	we look for light, and behold, darkness,
ISA.59.9	and for brightness, but we walk in gloom.
ISA.59.10	We grope for the wall like the blind,
ISA.59.10	we grope like those who have no eyes;
ISA.59.10	we stumble at noon as in the twilight,
ISA.59.10	among those in full vigor we are like dead men.
ISA.59.11	We all growl like bears,
ISA.59.11	we moan and moan like doves;
ISA.59.11	we look for justice, but there is none;
ISA.59.11	for salvation, but it is far from us.
ISA.59.12	For our transgressions are multiplied before thee,
ISA.59.12	and our sins testify against us;
ISA.59.12	for our transgressions are with us,
ISA.59.12	and we know our iniquities:
ISA.59.13	transgressing, and denying the 
ISA.59.13	and turning away from following our God,
ISA.59.13	speaking oppression and revolt,
ISA.59.13	conceiving and uttering from the heart lying words.
ISA.59.14	Justice is turned back,
ISA.59.14	and righteousness stands afar off;
ISA.59.14	for truth has fallen in the public squares,
ISA.59.14	and uprightness cannot enter.
ISA.59.15	Truth is lacking,
ISA.59.15	and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey.
ISA.59.15	The 
ISA.59.15	that there was no justice.
ISA.59.16	He saw that there was no man,
ISA.59.16	and wondered that there was no one to intervene;
ISA.59.16	then his own arm brought him victory,
ISA.59.16	and his righteousness upheld him.
ISA.59.17	and a helmet of salvation upon his head;
ISA.59.17	he put on garments of vengeance for clothing,
ISA.59.17	and wrapped himself in fury as a mantle.
ISA.59.18	According to their deeds, so will he repay,
ISA.59.18	wrath to his adversaries, requital to his enemies;
ISA.59.18	to the coastlands he will render requital.
ISA.59.19	and his glory from the rising of the sun;
ISA.59.19	for he will come like a rushing stream,
ISA.59.19	which the wind of the 
ISA.59.20	to those in Jacob who turn from transgression, says the 
ISA.59.21	“And as for me, this is my covenant with them, say the 
ISA.60.1	Arise, shine; for your light has come,
ISA.60.1	and the glory of the 
ISA.60.2	For behold, darkness shall cover the earth,
ISA.60.2	and thick darkness the peoples;
ISA.60.2	but the 
ISA.60.2	and his glory will be seen upon you.
ISA.60.3	And nations shall come to your light,
ISA.60.3	and kings to the brightness of your rising.
ISA.60.4	Lift up your eyes round about, and see;
ISA.60.4	they all gather together, they come to you;
ISA.60.4	your sons shall come from far,
ISA.60.4	and your daughters shall be carried in the arms.
ISA.60.5	Then you shall see and be radiant,
ISA.60.5	your heart shall thrill and rejoice;
ISA.60.5	because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you,
ISA.60.5	the wealth of the nations shall come to you.
ISA.60.6	the young camels of Midian and Ephah;
ISA.60.6	all those from Sheba shall come.
ISA.60.6	They shall bring gold and frankincense,
ISA.60.6	and shall proclaim the praise of the 
ISA.60.7	All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered to you,
ISA.60.7	the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you;
ISA.60.7	they shall come up with acceptance on my altar,
ISA.60.7	and I will glorify my glorious house.
ISA.60.8	Who are these that fly like a cloud,
ISA.60.8	and like doves to their windows?
ISA.60.9	For the coastlands shall wait for me,
ISA.60.9	the ships of Tarshish first,
ISA.60.9	to bring your sons from far,
ISA.60.9	their silver and gold with them,
ISA.60.9	for the name of the 
ISA.60.9	and for the Holy One of Israel,
ISA.60.9	because he has glorified you.
ISA.60.10	Foreigners shall build up your walls,
ISA.60.10	and their kings shall minister to you;
ISA.60.10	for in my wrath I smote you,
ISA.60.10	but in my favor I have had mercy on you.
ISA.60.11	day and night they shall not be shut;
ISA.60.11	that men may bring to you the wealth of the nations,
ISA.60.11	with their kings led in procession.
ISA.60.12	For the nation and kingdom
ISA.60.12	that will not serve you shall perish;
ISA.60.12	those nations shall be utterly laid waste.
ISA.60.13	The glory of Lebanon shall come to you,
ISA.60.13	the cypress, the plane, and the pine,
ISA.60.13	to beautify the place of my sanctuary;
ISA.60.13	and I will make the place of my feet glorious.
ISA.60.14	shall come bending low to you;
ISA.60.14	and all who despised you
ISA.60.14	shall bow down at your feet;
ISA.60.14	they shall call you the City of the 
ISA.60.14	the Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.60.15	Whereas you have been forsaken and hated,
ISA.60.15	with no one passing through,
ISA.60.15	I will make you majestic for ever,
ISA.60.15	a joy from age to age.
ISA.60.16	You shall suck the milk of nations,
ISA.60.16	you shall suck the breast of kings;
ISA.60.16	and you shall know that I, the 
ISA.60.16	and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
ISA.60.17	Instead of bronze I will bring gold,
ISA.60.17	and instead of iron I will bring silver;
ISA.60.17	instead of wood, bronze,
ISA.60.17	instead of stones, iron.
ISA.60.17	I will make your overseers peace
ISA.60.17	and your taskmasters righteousness.
ISA.60.18	Violence shall no more be heard in your land,
ISA.60.18	devastation or destruction within your borders;
ISA.60.18	you shall call your walls Salvation,
ISA.60.18	and your gates Praise.
ISA.60.19	your light by day,
ISA.60.19	nor for brightness shall the moon
ISA.60.19	give light to you by night;
ISA.60.19	but the 
ISA.60.19	and your God will be your glory.
ISA.60.20	Your sun shall no more go down,
ISA.60.20	nor your moon withdraw itself;
ISA.60.20	for the 
ISA.60.20	and your days of mourning shall be ended.
ISA.60.21	Your people shall all be righteous;
ISA.60.21	they shall possess the land for ever,
ISA.60.21	the shoot of my planting, the work of my hands,
ISA.60.21	that I might be glorified.
ISA.60.22	The least one shall become a clan,
ISA.60.22	and the smallest one a mighty nation;
ISA.60.22	I am the 
ISA.60.22	in its time I will hasten it.
ISA.61.1	because the 
ISA.61.1	to bring good tidings to the afflicted;
ISA.61.1	he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,
ISA.61.1	to proclaim liberty to the captives,
ISA.61.1	and the opening of the prison
ISA.61.2	to proclaim the year of the 
ISA.61.2	and the day of vengeance of our God;
ISA.61.2	to comfort all who mourn;
ISA.61.3	to grant to those who mourn in Zion—
ISA.61.3	to give them a garland instead of ashes,
ISA.61.3	the oil of gladness instead of mourning,
ISA.61.3	the mantle of praise instead of a faint spirit;
ISA.61.3	that they may be called oaks of righteousness,
ISA.61.3	the planting of the 
ISA.61.4	They shall build up the ancient ruins,
ISA.61.4	they shall raise up the former devastations;
ISA.61.4	they shall repair the ruined cities,
ISA.61.4	the devastations of many generations.
ISA.61.5	Aliens shall stand and feed your flocks,
ISA.61.5	foreigners shall be your plowmen and vinedressers;
ISA.61.6	men shall speak of you as the ministers of our God;
ISA.61.6	you shall eat the wealth of the nations,
ISA.61.6	and in their riches you shall glory.
ISA.61.7	Instead of your shame you shall have a double portion,
ISA.61.7	instead of dishonor you
ISA.61.7	therefore in your
ISA.61.7	yours
ISA.61.8	For I the 
ISA.61.8	I hate robbery and wrong;
ISA.61.8	I will faithfully give them their recompense,
ISA.61.8	and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
ISA.61.9	Their descendants shall be known among the nations,
ISA.61.9	and their offspring in the midst of the peoples;
ISA.61.9	all who see them shall acknowledge them,
ISA.61.9	that they are a people whom the 
ISA.61.10	I will greatly rejoice in the 
ISA.61.10	my soul shall exult in my God;
ISA.61.10	for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation,
ISA.61.10	he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,
ISA.61.10	as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland,
ISA.61.10	and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
ISA.61.11	For as the earth brings forth its shoots,
ISA.61.11	and as a garden causes what is sown in it to spring up,
ISA.61.11	so the Lord 
ISA.61.11	to spring forth before all the nations.
ISA.62.1	For Zion's sake I will not keep silent,
ISA.62.1	and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest,
ISA.62.1	until her vindication goes forth as brightness,
ISA.62.1	and her salvation as a burning torch.
ISA.62.2	and all the kings your glory;
ISA.62.2	and you shall be called by a new name
ISA.62.2	which the mouth of the 
ISA.62.3	You shall be a crown of beauty in the hand of the 
ISA.62.3	and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
ISA.62.4	You shall no more be termed Forsaken,
ISA.62.4	and your land shall no more be termed Desolate;
ISA.62.4	but you shall be called My delight is in her,
ISA.62.4	and your land Married;
ISA.62.4	for the 
ISA.62.4	and your land shall be married.
ISA.62.5	For as a young man marries a virgin,
ISA.62.5	so shall your sons marry you,
ISA.62.5	and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride,
ISA.62.5	so shall your God rejoice over you.
ISA.62.6	Upon your walls, O Jerusalem,
ISA.62.6	I have set watchmen;
ISA.62.6	all the day and all the night
ISA.62.6	they shall never be silent.
ISA.62.6	You who put the 
ISA.62.6	take no rest,
ISA.62.7	and give him no rest
ISA.62.7	until he establishes Jerusalem
ISA.62.7	and makes it a praise in the earth.
ISA.62.8	The 
ISA.62.8	and by his mighty arm:
ISA.62.8	“I will not again give your grain
ISA.62.8	to be food for your enemies,
ISA.62.8	and foreigners shall not drink your wine
ISA.62.8	for which you have labored;
ISA.62.9	but those who garner it shall eat it
ISA.62.9	and praise the 
ISA.62.9	and those who gather it shall drink it
ISA.62.9	in the courts of my sanctuary.”
ISA.62.10	Go through, go through the gates,
ISA.62.10	prepare the way for the people;
ISA.62.10	build up, build up the highway,
ISA.62.10	clear it of stones,
ISA.62.10	lift up an ensign over the peoples.
ISA.62.11	Behold, the 
ISA.62.11	to the end of the earth:
ISA.62.11	Say to the daughter of Zion,
ISA.62.11	“Behold, your salvation comes;
ISA.62.11	behold, his reward is with him,
ISA.62.11	and his recompense before him.”
ISA.62.12	And they shall be called The holy people,
ISA.62.12	The redeemed of the 
ISA.62.12	and you shall be called Sought out,
ISA.62.12	a city not forsaken.
ISA.63.1	in crimsoned garments from Bozrah,
ISA.63.1	he that is glorious in his apparel,
ISA.63.1	marching in the greatness of his strength?
ISA.63.1	“It is I, announcing vindication,
ISA.63.1	mighty to save.”
ISA.63.2	Why is thy apparel red,
ISA.63.2	and thy garments like his that treads in the wine press?
ISA.63.3	and from the peoples no one was with me;
ISA.63.3	I trod them in my anger
ISA.63.3	and trampled them in my wrath;
ISA.63.3	their lifeblood is sprinkled upon my garments,
ISA.63.3	and I have stained all my raiment.
ISA.63.4	For the day of vengeance was in my heart,
ISA.63.4	and my year of redemption
ISA.63.5	I looked, but there was no one to help;
ISA.63.5	I was appalled, but there was no one to uphold;
ISA.63.5	so my own arm brought me victory,
ISA.63.5	and my wrath upheld me.
ISA.63.6	I trod down the peoples in my anger,
ISA.63.6	I made them drunk in my wrath,
ISA.63.6	and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.”
ISA.63.7	I will recount the steadfast love of the 
ISA.63.7	the praises of the 
ISA.63.7	according to all that the 
ISA.63.7	and the great goodness to the house of Israel
ISA.63.7	which he has granted them according to his mercy,
ISA.63.7	according to the abundance of his steadfast love.
ISA.63.8	For he said, Surely they are my people,
ISA.63.8	sons who will not deal falsely;
ISA.63.8	and he became their Savior.
ISA.63.9	In all their affliction he was afflicted,
ISA.63.9	and the angel of his presence saved them;
ISA.63.9	in his love and in his pity he redeemed them;
ISA.63.9	he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old.
ISA.63.10	But they rebelled
ISA.63.10	and grieved his holy Spirit;
ISA.63.10	therefore he turned to be their enemy,
ISA.63.10	and himself fought against them.
ISA.63.11	of Moses his servant.
ISA.63.11	Where is he who brought up out of the sea
ISA.63.11	the shepherds of his flock?
ISA.63.11	Where is he who put in the midst of them
ISA.63.11	his holy Spirit,
ISA.63.12	who caused his glorious arm
ISA.63.12	to go at the right hand of Moses,
ISA.63.12	who divided the waters before them
ISA.63.12	to make for himself an everlasting name,
ISA.63.13	who led them through the depths?
ISA.63.13	Like a horse in the desert,
ISA.63.13	they did not stumble.
ISA.63.14	Like cattle that go down into the valley,
ISA.63.14	the Spirit of the 
ISA.63.14	So thou didst lead thy people,
ISA.63.14	to make for thyself a glorious name.
ISA.63.15	Look down from heaven and see,
ISA.63.15	from thy holy and glorious habitation.
ISA.63.15	Where are thy zeal and thy might?
ISA.63.15	The yearning of thy heart and thy compassion
ISA.63.15	are withheld from me.
ISA.63.16	For thou art our Father,
ISA.63.16	though Abraham does not know us
ISA.63.16	and Israel does not acknowledge us;
ISA.63.16	thou, O 
ISA.63.16	our Redeemer from of old is thy name.
ISA.63.17	O 
ISA.63.17	and harden our heart, so that we fear thee not?
ISA.63.17	Return for the sake of thy servants,
ISA.63.17	the tribes of thy heritage.
ISA.63.18	Thy holy people possessed thy sanctuary a little while;
ISA.63.18	our adversaries have trodden it down.
ISA.63.19	We have become like those over whom thou hast never ruled,
ISA.63.19	like those who are not called by thy name.
ISA.64.1	O that thou wouldst rend the heavens and come down,
ISA.64.1	that the mountains might quake at thy presence—
ISA.64.2	and the fire causes water to boil—
ISA.64.2	to make thy name known to thy adversaries,
ISA.64.2	and that the nations might tremble at thy presence!
ISA.64.3	When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for,
ISA.64.3	thou camest down, the mountains quaked at thy presence.
ISA.64.4	or perceived by the ear,
ISA.64.4	no eye has seen a God besides thee,
ISA.64.4	who works for those who wait for him.
ISA.64.5	Thou meetest him that joyfully works righteousness,
ISA.64.5	those that remember thee in thy ways.
ISA.64.5	Behold, thou wast angry, and we sinned;
ISA.64.5	in our sins we have been a long time, and shall we be saved?
ISA.64.6	We have all become like one who is unclean,
ISA.64.6	and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment.
ISA.64.6	We all fade like a leaf,
ISA.64.6	and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
ISA.64.7	There is no one that calls upon thy name,
ISA.64.7	that bestirs himself to take hold of thee;
ISA.64.7	for thou hast hid thy face from us,
ISA.64.7	and hast delivered
ISA.64.8	Yet, O 
ISA.64.8	we are the clay, and thou art our potter;
ISA.64.8	we are all the work of thy hand.
ISA.64.9	Be not exceedingly angry, O 
ISA.64.9	and remember not iniquity for ever.
ISA.64.9	Behold, consider, we are all thy people.
ISA.64.10	Thy holy cities have become a wilderness,
ISA.64.10	Zion has become a wilderness,
ISA.64.10	Jerusalem a desolation.
ISA.64.11	Our holy and beautiful house,
ISA.64.11	where our fathers praised thee,
ISA.64.11	has been burned by fire,
ISA.64.11	and all our pleasant places have become ruins.
ISA.64.12	Wilt thou restrain thyself at these things, O 
ISA.64.12	Wilt thou keep silent, and afflict us sorely?
ISA.65.1	I was ready to be found by those who did not seek me.
ISA.65.1	I said, “Here am I, here am I,”
ISA.65.1	to a nation that did not call on my name.
ISA.65.2	I spread out my hands all the day
ISA.65.2	to a rebellious people,
ISA.65.2	who walk in a way that is not good,
ISA.65.2	following their own devices;
ISA.65.3	a people who provoke me
ISA.65.3	to my face continually,
ISA.65.3	sacrificing in gardens
ISA.65.3	and burning incense upon bricks;
ISA.65.4	who sit in tombs,
ISA.65.4	and spend the night in secret places;
ISA.65.4	who eat swine's flesh,
ISA.65.4	and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;
ISA.65.5	who say, “Keep to yourself,
ISA.65.5	do not come near me, for I am set apart from you.”
ISA.65.5	These are a smoke in my nostrils,
ISA.65.5	a fire that burns all the day.
ISA.65.6	Behold, it is written before me:
ISA.65.6	“I will not keep silent, but I will repay,
ISA.65.6	yea, I will repay into their bosom
ISA.65.7	their
ISA.65.7	says the 
ISA.65.7	because they burned incense upon the mountains
ISA.65.7	and reviled me upon the hills,
ISA.65.7	I will measure into their bosom
ISA.65.7	payment for their former doings.”
ISA.65.8	Thus says the 
ISA.65.8	“As the wine is found in the cluster,
ISA.65.8	and they say, ‘Do not destroy it,
ISA.65.8	for there is a blessing in it,’
ISA.65.8	so I will do for my servants' sake,
ISA.65.8	and not destroy them all.
ISA.65.9	I will bring forth descendants from Jacob,
ISA.65.9	and from Judah inheritors of my mountains;
ISA.65.9	my chosen shall inherit it,
ISA.65.9	and my servants shall dwell there.
ISA.65.10	Sharon shall become a pasture for flocks,
ISA.65.10	and the Valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down,
ISA.65.10	for my people who have sought me.
ISA.65.11	But you who forsake the 
ISA.65.11	who forget my holy mountain,
ISA.65.11	who set a table for Fortune
ISA.65.11	and fill cups of mixed wine for Destiny;
ISA.65.12	I will destine you to the sword,
ISA.65.12	and all of you shall bow down to the slaughter;
ISA.65.12	because, when I called, you did not answer,
ISA.65.12	when I spoke, you did not listen,
ISA.65.12	but you did what was evil in my eyes,
ISA.65.12	and chose what I did not delight in.”
ISA.65.13	Therefore thus says the Lord 
ISA.65.13	“Behold, my servants shall eat,
ISA.65.13	but you shall be hungry;
ISA.65.13	behold, my servants shall drink,
ISA.65.13	but you shall be thirsty;
ISA.65.13	behold, my servants shall rejoice,
ISA.65.13	but you shall be put to shame;
ISA.65.14	behold, my servants shall sing for gladness of heart,
ISA.65.14	but you shall cry out for pain of heart,
ISA.65.14	and shall wail for anguish of spirit.
ISA.65.15	You shall leave your name to my chosen for a curse,
ISA.65.15	and the Lord 
ISA.65.15	but his servants he will call by a different name.
ISA.65.16	So that he who blesses himself in the land
ISA.65.16	shall bless himself by the God of truth,
ISA.65.16	and he who takes an oath in the land
ISA.65.16	shall swear by the God of truth;
ISA.65.16	because the former troubles are forgotten
ISA.65.16	and are hid from my eyes.
ISA.65.17	and a new earth;
ISA.65.17	and the former things shall not be remembered
ISA.65.17	or come into mind.
ISA.65.18	But be glad and rejoice for ever
ISA.65.18	in that which I create;
ISA.65.18	for behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing,
ISA.65.18	and her people a joy.
ISA.65.19	I will rejoice in Jerusalem,
ISA.65.19	and be glad in my people;
ISA.65.19	no more shall be heard in it the sound of weeping
ISA.65.19	and the cry of distress.
ISA.65.20	No more shall there be in it
ISA.65.20	an infant that lives but a few days,
ISA.65.20	or an old man who does not fill out his days,
ISA.65.20	for the child shall die a hundred years old,
ISA.65.20	and the sinner a hundred years old shall be accursed.
ISA.65.21	They shall build houses and inhabit them;
ISA.65.21	they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
ISA.65.22	They shall not build and another inhabit;
ISA.65.22	they shall not plant and another eat;
ISA.65.22	for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be,
ISA.65.22	and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
ISA.65.23	They shall not labor in vain,
ISA.65.23	or bear children for calamity;
ISA.65.23	for they shall be the offspring of the blessed of the 
ISA.65.23	and their children with them.
ISA.65.24	Before they call I will answer,
ISA.65.24	while they are yet speaking I will hear.
ISA.65.25	the lion shall eat straw like the ox;
ISA.65.25	and dust shall be the serpent's food.
ISA.65.25	They shall not hurt or destroy
ISA.65.25	in all my holy mountain,
ISA.65.25	says the 
ISA.66.1	“Heaven is my throne
ISA.66.1	and the earth is my footstool;
ISA.66.1	what is the house which you would build for me,
ISA.66.1	and what is the place of my rest?
ISA.66.2	All these things my hand has made,
ISA.66.2	and so all these things are mine,
ISA.66.2	says the 
ISA.66.2	But this is the man to whom I will look,
ISA.66.2	he that is humble and contrite in spirit,
ISA.66.2	and trembles at my word.
ISA.66.3	“He who slaughters an ox is like him who kills a man;
ISA.66.3	he who sacrifices a lamb, like him who breaks a dog's neck;
ISA.66.3	he who presents a cereal offering, like him who offers swine's blood;
ISA.66.3	he who makes a memorial offering of frankincense, like him who blesses an idol.
ISA.66.3	These have chosen their own ways,
ISA.66.3	and their soul delights in their abominations;
ISA.66.4	I also will choose affliction for them,
ISA.66.4	and bring their fears upon them;
ISA.66.4	because, when I called, no one answered,
ISA.66.4	when I spoke they did not listen;
ISA.66.4	but they did what was evil in my eyes,
ISA.66.4	and chose that in which I did not delight.”
ISA.66.5	Hear the word of the 
ISA.66.5	you who tremble at his word:
ISA.66.5	“Your brethren who hate you
ISA.66.5	and cast you out for my name's sake
ISA.66.5	have said, ‘Let the 
ISA.66.5	that we may see your joy’;
ISA.66.5	but it is they who shall be put to shame.
ISA.66.6	A voice from the temple!
ISA.66.6	The voice of the 
ISA.66.6	rendering recompense to his enemies!
ISA.66.7	she gave birth;
ISA.66.7	before her pain came upon her
ISA.66.7	she was delivered of a son.
ISA.66.8	Who has heard such a thing?
ISA.66.8	Who has seen such things?
ISA.66.8	Shall a land be born in one day?
ISA.66.8	Shall a nation be brought forth in one moment?
ISA.66.8	For as soon as Zion was in labor
ISA.66.8	she brought forth her sons.
ISA.66.9	Shall I bring to the birth and not cause to bring forth?
ISA.66.9	says the 
ISA.66.9	shall I, who cause to bring forth, shut the womb?
ISA.66.9	says your God.
ISA.66.10	“Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her,
ISA.66.10	all you who love her;
ISA.66.10	rejoice with her in joy,
ISA.66.10	all you who mourn over her;
ISA.66.11	that you may suck and be satisfied
ISA.66.11	with her consoling breasts;
ISA.66.11	that you may drink deeply with delight
ISA.66.11	from the abundance of her glory.”
ISA.66.12	For thus says the 
ISA.66.12	“Behold, I will extend prosperity to her like a river,
ISA.66.12	and the wealth of the nations like an overflowing stream;

JER.1.1	The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, 
JER.1.2	to whom the word of the 
JER.1.3	It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, and until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the captivity of Jerusalem in the fifth month.
JER.1.4	Now the word of the 
JER.1.5	and before you were born I consecrated you;
JER.1.5	I appointed you a prophet to the nations.”
JER.1.6	Then I said, “Ah, Lord 
JER.1.7	But the 
JER.1.7	“Do not say, ‘I am only a youth’;
JER.1.7	for to all to whom I send you shall go,
JER.1.7	and whatever I command you shall speak.
JER.1.8	for I am with you to deliver you,
JER.1.8	says the 
JER.1.9	Then the 
JER.1.9	“Behold, I have put my words in your mouth.
JER.1.10	to pluck up and to break down,
JER.1.10	to destroy and to overthrow,
JER.1.10	to build and to plant.”
JER.1.11	And the word of the 
JER.1.12	Then the 
JER.1.13	The word of the 
JER.1.14	Then the 
JER.1.15	For lo, I am calling all the tribes of the kingdoms of the north, says the 
JER.1.16	And I will utter my judgments against them, for all their wickedness in forsaking me; they have burned incense to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands. 
JER.1.17	But you, gird up your loins; arise, and say to them everything that I command you. Do not be dismayed by them, lest I dismay you before them. 
JER.1.18	And I, behold, I make you this day a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, its princes, its priests, and the people of the land. 
JER.1.19	They will fight against you; but they shall not prevail against you, for I am with you, says the 
JER.2.1	The word of the 
JER.2.2	“Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem, Thus says the 
JER.2.2	I remember the devotion of your youth,
JER.2.2	your love as a bride,
JER.2.2	how you followed me in the wilderness,
JER.2.2	in a land not sown.
JER.2.3	Israel was holy to the 
JER.2.3	the first fruits of his harvest.
JER.2.3	All who ate of it became guilty;
JER.2.3	evil came upon them,
JER.2.3	says the 
JER.2.4	Hear the word of the 
JER.2.5	Thus says the 
JER.2.5	“What wrong did your fathers find in me
JER.2.5	that they went far from me,
JER.2.5	and went after worthlessness, and became worthless?
JER.2.6	They did not say, ‘Where is the 
JER.2.6	who brought us up from the land of Egypt,
JER.2.6	who led us in the wilderness,
JER.2.6	in a land of deserts and pits,
JER.2.6	in a land of drought and deep darkness,
JER.2.6	in a land that none passes through,
JER.2.6	where no man dwells?’
JER.2.7	And I brought you into a plentiful land
JER.2.7	to enjoy its fruits and its good things.
JER.2.7	But when you came in you defiled my land,
JER.2.7	and made my heritage an abomination.
JER.2.8	The priests did not say, ‘Where is the 
JER.2.8	Those who handle the law did not know me;
JER.2.8	the rulers
JER.2.8	the prophets prophesied by Baal,
JER.2.8	and went after things that do not profit.
JER.2.9	“Therefore I still contend with you,
JER.2.9	says the 
JER.2.9	and with your children's children I will contend.
JER.2.10	For cross to the coasts of Cyprus and see,
JER.2.10	or send to Kedar and examine with care;
JER.2.10	see if there has been such a thing.
JER.2.11	Has a nation changed its gods,
JER.2.11	even though they are no gods?
JER.2.11	But my people have changed their glory
JER.2.11	for that which does not profit.
JER.2.12	Be appalled, O heavens, at this,
JER.2.12	be shocked, be utterly desolate,
JER.2.12	says the 
JER.2.13	for my people have committed two evils:
JER.2.13	they have forsaken me,
JER.2.13	the fountain of living waters,
JER.2.13	and hewed out cisterns for themselves,
JER.2.13	broken cisterns,
JER.2.13	that can hold no water.
JER.2.14	“Is Israel a slave? Is he a homeborn servant?
JER.2.14	Why then has he become a prey?
JER.2.15	The lions have roared against him,
JER.2.15	they have roared loudly.
JER.2.15	They have made his land a waste;
JER.2.15	his cities are in ruins, without inhabitant.
JER.2.16	Moreover, the men of Memphis and Tahpanhes
JER.2.16	have broken the crown of your head.
JER.2.17	Have you not brought this upon yourself
JER.2.17	by forsaking the 
JER.2.17	when he led you in the way?
JER.2.18	And now what do you gain by going to Egypt,
JER.2.18	to drink the waters of the Nile?
JER.2.18	Or what do you gain by going to Assyria,
JER.2.18	to drink the waters of the Euphrates?
JER.2.19	Your wickedness will chasten you,
JER.2.19	and your apostasy will reprove you.
JER.2.19	Know and see that it is evil and bitter
JER.2.19	for you to forsake the 
JER.2.19	the fear of me is not in you,
JER.2.19	says the Lord 
JER.2.20	“For long ago you broke your yoke
JER.2.20	and burst your bonds;
JER.2.20	and you said, ‘I will not serve.’
JER.2.20	Yea, upon every high hill
JER.2.20	and under every green tree
JER.2.20	you bowed down as a harlot.
JER.2.21	Yet I planted you a choice vine,
JER.2.21	wholly of pure seed.
JER.2.21	How then have you turned degenerate
JER.2.21	and become a wild vine?
JER.2.22	Though you wash yourself with lye
JER.2.22	and use much soap,
JER.2.22	the stain of your guilt is still before me,
JER.2.22	says the Lord 
JER.2.23	How can you say, ‘I am not defiled,
JER.2.23	I have not gone after the Baals’?
JER.2.23	Look at your way in the valley;
JER.2.23	know what you have done—
JER.2.23	a restive young camel interlacing her tracks,
JER.2.24	a wild ass used to the wilderness,
JER.2.24	in her heat sniffing the wind!
JER.2.24	Who can restrain her lust?
JER.2.24	None who seek her need weary themselves;
JER.2.24	in her month they will find her.
JER.2.25	Keep your feet from going unshod
JER.2.25	and your throat from thirst.
JER.2.25	But you said, ‘It is hopeless,
JER.2.25	for I have loved strangers,
JER.2.25	and after them I will go.’
JER.2.26	“As a thief is shamed when caught,
JER.2.26	so the house of Israel shall be shamed:
JER.2.26	they, their kings, their princes,
JER.2.26	their priests, and their prophets,
JER.2.27	who say to a tree, ‘You are my father,’
JER.2.27	and to a stone, ‘You gave me birth.’
JER.2.27	For they have turned their back to me,
JER.2.27	and not their face.
JER.2.27	But in the time of their trouble they say,
JER.2.27	‘Arise and save us!’
JER.2.28	But where are your gods
JER.2.28	that you made for yourself?
JER.2.28	Let them arise, if they can save you,
JER.2.28	in your time of trouble;
JER.2.28	for as many as your cities
JER.2.28	are your gods, O Judah.
JER.2.29	“Why do you complain against me?
JER.2.29	You have all rebelled against me,
JER.2.29	says the 
JER.2.30	In vain have I smitten your children,
JER.2.30	they took no correction;
JER.2.30	your own sword devoured your prophets
JER.2.30	like a ravening lion.
JER.2.31	And you, O generation, heed the word of the 
JER.2.31	Have I been a wilderness to Israel,
JER.2.31	or a land of thick darkness?
JER.2.31	Why then do my people say, ‘We are free,
JER.2.31	we will come no more to thee’?
JER.2.32	Can a maiden forget her ornaments,
JER.2.32	or a bride her attire?
JER.2.32	Yet my people have forgotten me
JER.2.32	days without number.
JER.2.33	“How well you direct your course
JER.2.33	to seek lovers!
JER.2.33	So that even to wicked women
JER.2.33	you have taught your ways.
JER.2.34	Also on your skirts is found
JER.2.34	the lifeblood of guiltless poor;
JER.2.34	you did not find them breaking in.
JER.2.34	Yet in spite of all these things
JER.2.35	you say, ‘I am innocent;
JER.2.35	surely his anger has turned from me.’
JER.2.35	Behold, I will bring you to judgment
JER.2.35	for saying, ‘I have not sinned.’
JER.2.36	How lightly you gad about,
JER.2.36	changing your way!
JER.2.36	You shall be put to shame by Egypt
JER.2.36	as you were put to shame by Assyria.
JER.2.37	From it too you will come away
JER.2.37	with your hands upon your head,
JER.2.37	for the 
JER.2.37	and you will not prosper by them.
JER.3.1	“If
JER.3.1	and she goes from him
JER.3.1	and becomes another man's wife,
JER.3.1	will he return to her?
JER.3.1	Would not that land be greatly polluted?
JER.3.1	You have played the harlot with many lovers;
JER.3.1	and would you return to me?
JER.3.1	says the 
JER.3.2	Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see!
JER.3.2	Where have you not been lain with?
JER.3.2	By the waysides you have sat awaiting lovers
JER.3.2	like an Arab in the wilderness.
JER.3.2	You have polluted the land
JER.3.2	with your vile harlotry.
JER.3.3	Therefore the showers have been withheld,
JER.3.3	and the spring rain has not come;
JER.3.3	yet you have a harlot's brow,
JER.3.3	you refuse to be ashamed.
JER.3.4	Have you not just now called to me,
JER.3.4	‘My father, thou art the friend of my youth—
JER.3.5	will he be angry for ever,
JER.3.5	will he be indignant to the end?’
JER.3.5	Behold, you have spoken,
JER.3.5	but you have done all the evil that you could.”
JER.3.6	The 
JER.3.7	And I thought, ‘After she has done all this she will return to me’; but she did not return, and her false sister Judah saw it. 
JER.3.8	She saw that for all the adulteries of that faithless one, Israel, I had sent her away with a decree of divorce; yet her false sister Judah did not fear, but she too went and played the harlot. 
JER.3.9	Because harlotry was so light to her, she polluted the land, committing adultery with stone and tree. 
JER.3.10	Yet for all this her false sister Judah did not return to me with her whole heart, but in pretense, says the 
JER.3.11	And the 
JER.3.12	Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say,
JER.3.12	‘Return, faithless Israel,
JER.3.12	says the 
JER.3.12	I will not look on you in anger,
JER.3.12	for I am merciful,
JER.3.12	says the 
JER.3.12	I will not be angry for ever.
JER.3.13	Only acknowledge your guilt,
JER.3.13	that you rebelled against the 
JER.3.13	and scattered your favors among strangers under every green tree,
JER.3.13	and that you have not obeyed my voice,
JER.3.13	says the 
JER.3.14	Return, O faithless children,
JER.3.14	says the 
JER.3.14	for I am your master;
JER.3.14	I will take you, one from a city and two from a family,
JER.3.14	and I will bring you to Zion.
JER.3.15	“ ‘And I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding. 
JER.3.16	And when you have multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, says the 
JER.3.17	At that time Jerusalem shall be called the throne of the 
JER.3.18	In those days the house of Judah shall join the house of Israel, and together they shall come from the land of the north to the land that I gave your fathers for a heritage.
JER.3.19	“ ‘I thought
JER.3.19	how I would set you among my sons,
JER.3.19	and give you a pleasant land,
JER.3.19	a heritage most beauteous of all nations.
JER.3.19	And I thought you would call me, My Father,
JER.3.19	and would not turn from following me.
JER.3.20	Surely, as a faithless wife leaves her husband,
JER.3.20	so have you been faithless to me, O house of Israel,
JER.3.20	says the 
JER.3.21	A voice on the bare heights is heard,
JER.3.21	the weeping and pleading of Israel's sons
JER.3.21	because they have perverted their way,
JER.3.21	they have forgotten the 
JER.3.22	“Return, O faithless sons,
JER.3.22	I will heal your faithlessness.”
JER.3.22	“Behold, we come to thee;
JER.3.22	for thou art the 
JER.3.23	Truly the hills are a delusion,
JER.3.23	the orgies on the mountains.
JER.3.23	Truly in the 
JER.3.23	is the salvation of Israel.
JER.3.24	“But from our youth the shameful thing has devoured all for which our fathers labored, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. 
JER.3.25	Let us lie down in our shame, and let our dishonor cover us; for we have sinned against the 
JER.4.1	“If you return, O Israel,
JER.4.1	says the 
JER.4.1	to me you should return.
JER.4.1	If you remove your abominations from my presence,
JER.4.1	and do not waver,
JER.4.2	and if you swear, ‘As the 
JER.4.2	in truth, in justice, and in uprightness,
JER.4.2	then nations shall bless themselves in him,
JER.4.2	and in him shall they glory.”
JER.4.3	For thus says the 
JER.4.3	“Break up your fallow ground,
JER.4.3	and sow not among thorns.
JER.4.4	Circumcise yourselves to the 
JER.4.4	remove the foreskin of your hearts,
JER.4.4	O men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem;
JER.4.4	lest my wrath go forth like fire,
JER.4.4	and burn with none to quench it,
JER.4.4	because of the evil of your doings.”
JER.4.5	Declare in Judah, and proclaim in Jerusalem, and say,
JER.4.5	“Blow the trumpet through the land;
JER.4.5	cry aloud and say,
JER.4.5	‘Assemble, and let us go
JER.4.5	into the fortified cities!’
JER.4.6	Raise a standard toward Zion,
JER.4.6	flee for safety, stay not,
JER.4.6	for I bring evil from the north,
JER.4.6	and great destruction.
JER.4.7	A lion has gone up from his thicket,
JER.4.7	a destroyer of nations has set out;
JER.4.7	he has gone forth from his place
JER.4.7	to make your land a waste;
JER.4.7	your cities will be ruins
JER.4.7	without inhabitant.
JER.4.8	For this gird you with sackcloth,
JER.4.8	lament and wail;
JER.4.8	for the fierce anger of the 
JER.4.8	has not turned back from us.”
JER.4.9	“In that day, says the 
JER.4.10	Then I said, “Ah, Lord 
JER.4.11	At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, “A hot wind from the bare heights in the desert toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow or cleanse, 
JER.4.12	a wind too full for this comes for me. Now it is I who speak in judgment upon them.”
JER.4.13	Behold, he comes up like clouds,
JER.4.13	his chariots like the whirlwind;
JER.4.13	his horses are swifter than eagles—
JER.4.13	woe to us, for we are ruined!
JER.4.14	O Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness,
JER.4.14	that you may be saved.
JER.4.14	How long shall your evil thoughts
JER.4.14	lodge within you?
JER.4.15	For a voice declares from Dan
JER.4.15	and proclaims evil from Mount Ephraim.
JER.4.16	Warn the nations that he is coming;
JER.4.16	announce to Jerusalem,
JER.4.16	“Besiegers come from a distant land;
JER.4.16	they shout against the cities of Judah.
JER.4.17	Like keepers of a field are they against her round about,
JER.4.17	because she has rebelled against me,
JER.4.17	says the 
JER.4.18	Your ways and your doings
JER.4.18	have brought this upon you.
JER.4.18	This is your doom, and it is bitter;
JER.4.18	it has reached your very heart.”
JER.4.19	My anguish, my anguish! I writhe in pain!
JER.4.19	Oh, the walls of my heart!
JER.4.19	My heart is beating wildly;
JER.4.19	I cannot keep silent;
JER.4.19	for I hear the sound of the trumpet,
JER.4.19	the alarm of war.
JER.4.20	Disaster follows hard on disaster,
JER.4.20	the whole land is laid waste.
JER.4.20	Suddenly my tents are destroyed,
JER.4.20	my curtains in a moment.
JER.4.21	How long must I see the standard,
JER.4.21	and hear the sound of the trumpet?
JER.4.22	“For my people are foolish,
JER.4.22	they know me not;
JER.4.22	they are stupid children,
JER.4.22	they have no understanding.
JER.4.22	They are skilled in doing evil,
JER.4.22	but how to do good they know not.”
JER.4.23	I looked on the earth, and lo, it was waste and void;
JER.4.23	and to the heavens, and they had no light.
JER.4.24	I looked on the mountains, and lo, they were quaking,
JER.4.24	and all the hills moved to and fro.
JER.4.25	I looked, and lo, there was no man,
JER.4.25	and all the birds of the air had fled.
JER.4.26	I looked, and lo, the fruitful land was a desert,
JER.4.26	and all its cities were laid in ruins
JER.4.26	before the 
JER.4.27	For thus says the 
JER.4.28	For this the earth shall mourn,
JER.4.28	and the heavens above be black;
JER.4.28	for I have spoken, I have purposed;
JER.4.28	I have not relented nor will I turn back.”
JER.4.29	At the noise of horseman and archer
JER.4.29	every city takes to flight;
JER.4.29	they enter thickets; they climb among rocks;
JER.4.29	all the cities are forsaken,
JER.4.29	and no man dwells in them.
JER.4.30	And you, O desolate one,
JER.4.30	what do you mean that you dress in scarlet,
JER.4.30	that you deck yourself with ornaments of gold,
JER.4.30	that you enlarge your eyes with paint?
JER.4.30	In vain you beautify yourself.
JER.4.30	Your lovers despise you;
JER.4.30	they seek your life.
JER.4.31	For I heard a cry as of a woman in travail,
JER.4.31	anguish as of one bringing forth her first child,
JER.4.31	the cry of the daughter of Zion gasping for breath,
JER.4.31	stretching out her hands,
JER.4.31	“Woe is me! I am fainting before murderers.”
JER.5.1	Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem,
JER.5.1	look and take note!
JER.5.1	Search her squares to see
JER.5.1	if you can find a man,
JER.5.1	one who does justice
JER.5.1	and seeks truth;
JER.5.1	that I may pardon her.
JER.5.2	Though they say, “As the 
JER.5.2	yet they swear falsely.
JER.5.3	O 
JER.5.3	Thou hast smitten them,
JER.5.3	but they felt no anguish;
JER.5.3	thou hast consumed them,
JER.5.3	but they refused to take correction.
JER.5.3	They have made their faces harder than rock;
JER.5.3	they have refused to repent.
JER.5.4	Then I said, “These are only the poor,
JER.5.4	they have no sense;
JER.5.4	for they do not know the way of the 
JER.5.4	the law of their God.
JER.5.5	I will go to the great,
JER.5.5	and will speak to them;
JER.5.5	for they know the way of the 
JER.5.5	the law of their God.”
JER.5.5	But they all alike had broken the yoke,
JER.5.5	they had burst the bonds.
JER.5.6	Therefore a lion from the forest shall slay them,
JER.5.6	a wolf from the desert shall destroy them.
JER.5.6	A leopard is watching against their cities,
JER.5.6	every one who goes out of them shall be torn in pieces;
JER.5.6	because their transgressions are many,
JER.5.6	their apostasies are great.
JER.5.7	“How can I pardon you?
JER.5.7	Your children have forsaken me,
JER.5.7	and have sworn by those who are no gods.
JER.5.7	When I fed them to the full,
JER.5.7	they committed adultery
JER.5.7	and trooped to the houses of harlots.
JER.5.8	They were well-fed lusty stallions,
JER.5.8	each neighing for his neighbor's wife.
JER.5.9	Shall I not punish them for these things?
JER.5.9	says the 
JER.5.9	and shall I not avenge myself
JER.5.9	on a nation such as this?
JER.5.10	“Go up through her vine-rows and destroy,
JER.5.10	but make not a full end;
JER.5.10	strip away her branches,
JER.5.10	for they are not the 
JER.5.11	For the house of Israel and the house of Judah
JER.5.11	have been utterly faithless to me,
JER.5.11	says the 
JER.5.12	They have spoken falsely of the 
JER.5.12	and have said, ‘He will do nothing;
JER.5.12	no evil will come upon us,
JER.5.12	nor shall we see sword or famine.
JER.5.13	The prophets will become wind;
JER.5.13	the word is not in them.
JER.5.13	Thus shall it be done to them!’ ”
JER.5.14	Therefore thus says the 
JER.5.14	“Because they
JER.5.14	behold, I am making my words in your mouth a fire,
JER.5.14	and this people wood, and the fire shall devour them.
JER.5.15	Behold, I am bringing upon you
JER.5.15	a nation from afar, O house of Israel,
JER.5.15	says the 
JER.5.15	It is an enduring nation,
JER.5.15	it is an ancient nation,
JER.5.15	a nation whose language you do not know,
JER.5.15	nor can you understand what they say.
JER.5.16	Their quiver is like an open tomb,
JER.5.16	they are all mighty men.
JER.5.17	They shall eat up your harvest and your food;
JER.5.17	they shall eat up your sons and your daughters;
JER.5.17	they shall eat up your flocks and your herds;
JER.5.17	they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees;
JER.5.17	your fortified cities in which you trust
JER.5.17	they shall destroy with the sword.”
JER.5.18	“But even in those days, says the 
JER.5.19	And when your people say, ‘Why has the 
JER.5.20	Declare this in the house of Jacob,
JER.5.20	proclaim it in Judah:
JER.5.21	who have eyes, but see not,
JER.5.21	who have ears, but hear not.
JER.5.22	Do you not fear me? says the 
JER.5.22	Do you not tremble before me?
JER.5.22	I placed the sand as the bound for the sea,
JER.5.22	a perpetual barrier which it cannot pass;
JER.5.22	though the waves toss, they cannot prevail,
JER.5.22	though they roar, they cannot pass over it.
JER.5.23	But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart;
JER.5.23	they have turned aside and gone away.
JER.5.24	They do not say in their hearts,
JER.5.24	‘Let us fear the 
JER.5.24	who gives the rain in its season,
JER.5.24	the autumn rain and the spring rain,
JER.5.24	and keeps for us
JER.5.24	the weeks appointed for the harvest.’
JER.5.25	Your iniquities have turned these away,
JER.5.25	and your sins have kept good from you.
JER.5.26	For wicked men are found among my people;
JER.5.26	they lurk like fowlers lying in wait.
JER.5.26	They set a trap;
JER.5.26	they catch men.
JER.5.27	Like a basket full of birds,
JER.5.27	their houses are full of treachery;
JER.5.27	therefore they have become great and rich,
JER.5.28	they have grown fat and sleek.
JER.5.28	They know no bounds in deeds of wickedness;
JER.5.28	they judge not with justice
JER.5.28	the cause of the fatherless, to make it prosper,
JER.5.28	and they do not defend the rights of the needy.
JER.5.29	Shall I not punish them for these things?
JER.5.29	says the 
JER.5.29	and shall I not avenge myself
JER.5.29	on a nation such as this?”
JER.5.30	An appalling and horrible thing
JER.5.30	has happened in the land:
JER.5.31	the prophets prophesy falsely,
JER.5.31	and the priests rule at their direction;
JER.5.31	my people love to have it so,
JER.5.31	but what will you do when the end comes?
JER.6.1	Flee for safety, O people of Benjamin,
JER.6.1	from the midst of Jerusalem!
JER.6.1	Blow the trumpet in Tekoa,
JER.6.1	and raise a signal on Beth-haccherem;
JER.6.1	for evil looms out of the north,
JER.6.1	and great destruction.
JER.6.2	The comely and delicately bred I will destroy,
JER.6.2	the daughter of Zion.
JER.6.3	Shepherds with their flocks shall come against her;
JER.6.3	they shall pitch their tents around her,
JER.6.3	they shall pasture, each in his place.
JER.6.4	“Prepare war against her;
JER.6.4	up, and let us attack at noon!”
JER.6.4	“Woe to us, for the day declines,
JER.6.4	for the shadows of evening lengthen!”
JER.6.5	“Up, and let us attack by night,
JER.6.5	and destroy her palaces!”
JER.6.6	For thus says the 
JER.6.6	“Hew down her trees;
JER.6.6	cast up a siege mound against Jerusalem.
JER.6.6	This is the city which must be punished;
JER.6.6	there is nothing but oppression within her.
JER.6.7	As a well keeps its water fresh,
JER.6.7	so she keeps fresh her wickedness;
JER.6.7	violence and destruction are heard within her;
JER.6.7	sickness and wounds are ever before me.
JER.6.8	Be warned, O Jerusalem,
JER.6.8	lest I be alienated from you;
JER.6.8	lest I make you a desolation,
JER.6.8	an uninhabited land.”
JER.6.9	Thus says the 
JER.6.9	“Glean
JER.6.9	the remnant of Israel;
JER.6.9	like a grape-gatherer pass your hand again
JER.6.9	over its branches.”
JER.6.10	To whom shall I speak and give warning,
JER.6.10	that they may hear?
JER.6.10	Behold, their ears are closed,
JER.6.10	they cannot listen;
JER.6.10	behold, the word of the 
JER.6.10	they take no pleasure in it.
JER.6.11	Therefore I am full of the wrath of the 
JER.6.11	I am weary of holding it in.
JER.6.11	“Pour it out upon the children in the street,
JER.6.11	and upon the gatherings of young men, also;
JER.6.11	both husband and wife shall be taken,
JER.6.11	the old folk and the very aged.
JER.6.12	Their houses shall be turned over to others,
JER.6.12	their fields and wives together;
JER.6.12	for I will stretch out my hand
JER.6.12	against the inhabitants of the land,”
JER.6.12	says the 
JER.6.13	“For from the least to the greatest of them,
JER.6.13	every one is greedy for unjust gain;
JER.6.13	and from prophet to priest,
JER.6.13	every one deals falsely.
JER.6.14	They have healed the wound of my people lightly,
JER.6.14	saying, ‘Peace, peace,’
JER.6.14	when there is no peace.
JER.6.15	Were they ashamed when they committed abomination?
JER.6.15	No, they were not at all ashamed;
JER.6.15	they did not know how to blush.
JER.6.15	Therefore they shall fall among those who fall;
JER.6.15	at the time that I punish them, they shall be overthrown,”
JER.6.15	says the 
JER.6.16	“Stand by the roads, and look,
JER.6.16	and ask for the ancient paths,
JER.6.16	where the good way is; and walk in it,
JER.6.16	and find rest for your souls.
JER.6.16	But they said, ‘We will not walk in it.’
JER.6.17	I set watchmen over you, saying,
JER.6.17	‘Give heed to the sound of the trumpet!’
JER.6.17	But they said, ‘We will not give heed.’
JER.6.18	Therefore hear, O nations,
JER.6.18	and know, O congregation, what will happen to them.
JER.6.19	Hear, O earth; behold, I am bringing evil upon this people,
JER.6.19	the fruit of their devices,
JER.6.19	because they have not given heed to my words;
JER.6.19	and as for my law, they have rejected it.
JER.6.20	To what purpose does frankincense come to me from Sheba,
JER.6.20	or sweet cane from a distant land?
JER.6.20	Your burnt offerings are not acceptable,
JER.6.20	nor your sacrifices pleasing to me.
JER.6.21	Therefore thus says the 
JER.6.21	‘Behold, I will lay before this people
JER.6.21	stumbling blocks against which they shall stumble;
JER.6.21	fathers and sons together,
JER.6.21	neighbor and friend shall perish.’ ”
JER.6.22	Thus says the 
JER.6.22	“Behold, a people is coming from the north country,
JER.6.22	a great nation is stirring from the farthest parts of the earth.
JER.6.23	They lay hold on bow and spear,
JER.6.23	they are cruel and have no mercy,
JER.6.23	the sound of them is like the roaring sea;
JER.6.23	they ride upon horses,
JER.6.23	set in array as a man for battle,
JER.6.23	against you, O daughter of Zion!”
JER.6.24	We have heard the report of it,
JER.6.24	our hands fall helpless;
JER.6.24	anguish has taken hold of us,
JER.6.24	pain as of a woman in travail.
JER.6.25	nor walk on the road;
JER.6.25	for the enemy has a sword,
JER.6.25	terror is on every side.
JER.6.26	O daughter of my people, gird on sackcloth,
JER.6.26	and roll in ashes;
JER.6.26	make mourning as for an only son,
JER.6.26	most bitter lamentation;
JER.6.26	for suddenly the destroyer
JER.6.26	will come upon us.
JER.6.27	“I have made you an assayer and tester among my people,
JER.6.27	that you may know and assay their ways.
JER.6.28	They are all stubbornly rebellious,
JER.6.28	going about with slanders;
JER.6.28	they are bronze and iron,
JER.6.28	all of them act corruptly.
JER.6.29	The bellows blow fiercely,
JER.6.29	the lead is consumed by the fire;
JER.6.29	in vain the refining goes on,
JER.6.29	for the wicked are not removed.
JER.6.30	Refuse silver they are called,
JER.6.30	for the 
JER.7.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.7.2	“Stand in the gate of the 
JER.7.3	Thus says the 
JER.7.4	Do not trust in these deceptive words: ‘This is the temple of the 
JER.7.5	“For if you truly amend your ways and your doings, if you truly execute justice one with another, 
JER.7.6	if you do not oppress the alien, the fatherless or the widow, or shed innocent blood in this place, and if you do not go after other gods to your own hurt, 
JER.7.7	then I will let you dwell in this place, in the land that I gave of old to your fathers for ever.
JER.7.8	“Behold, you trust in deceptive words to no avail. 
JER.7.9	Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, burn incense to Baal, and go after other gods that you have not known, 
JER.7.10	and then come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, ‘We are delivered!’—only to go on doing all these abominations? 
JER.7.11	 Has this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I myself have seen it, says the 
JER.7.12	Go now to my place that was in Shiloh, where I made my name dwell at first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel. 
JER.7.13	And now, because you have done all these things, says the 
JER.7.14	therefore I will do to the house which is called by my name, and in which you trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh. 
JER.7.15	And I will cast you out of my sight, as I cast out all your kinsmen, all the offspring of Ephraim.
JER.7.16	“As for you, do not pray for this people, or lift up cry or prayer for them, and do not intercede with me, for I do not hear you. 
JER.7.17	Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.7.18	The children gather wood, the fathers kindle fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes for the queen of heaven; and they pour out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger. 
JER.7.19	Is it I whom they provoke? says the 
JER.7.20	Therefore thus says the Lord 
JER.7.21	Thus says the 
JER.7.22	For in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak to your fathers or command them concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices. 
JER.7.23	But this command I gave them, ‘Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people; and walk in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.’ 
JER.7.24	But they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked in their own counsels and the stubbornness of their evil hearts, and went backward and not forward. 
JER.7.25	From the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt to this day, I have persistently sent all my servants the prophets to them, day after day; 
JER.7.26	yet they did not listen to me, or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck. They did worse than their fathers.
JER.7.27	“So you shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you. You shall call to them, but they will not answer you. 
JER.7.28	And you shall say to them, ‘This is the nation that did not obey the voice of the 
JER.7.29	Cut off your hair and cast it away;
JER.7.29	raise a lamentation on the bare heights,
JER.7.29	for the 
JER.7.29	the generation of his wrath.’
JER.7.30	“For the sons of Judah have done evil in my sight, says the 
JER.7.31	And they have built the high place
JER.7.32	Therefore, behold, the days are coming, says the 
JER.7.33	And the dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the air, and for the beasts of the earth; and none will frighten them away. 
JER.7.34	 And I will make to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land shall become a waste.
JER.8.1	“At that time, says the 
JER.8.2	and they shall be spread before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven, which they have loved and served, which they have gone after, and which they have sought and worshiped; and they shall not be gathered or buried; they shall be as dung on the surface of the ground. 
JER.8.3	Death shall be preferred to life by all the remnant that remains of this evil family in all the places where I have driven them, says the 
JER.8.4	“You shall say to them, Thus says the 
JER.8.4	When men fall, do they not rise again?
JER.8.4	If one turns away, does he not return?
JER.8.5	Why then has this people turned away
JER.8.5	in perpetual backsliding?
JER.8.5	They hold fast to deceit,
JER.8.5	they refuse to return.
JER.8.6	I have given heed and listened,
JER.8.6	but they have not spoken aright;
JER.8.6	no man repents of his wickedness,
JER.8.6	saying, ‘What have I done?’
JER.8.6	Every one turns to his own course,
JER.8.6	like a horse plunging headlong into battle.
JER.8.7	Even the stork in the heavens
JER.8.7	knows her times;
JER.8.7	and the turtledove, swallow, and crane
JER.8.7	keep the time of their coming;
JER.8.7	but my people know not
JER.8.7	the ordinance of the 
JER.8.8	“How can you say, ‘We are wise,
JER.8.8	and the law of the 
JER.8.8	But behold, the false pen of the scribes
JER.8.8	has made it into a lie.
JER.8.9	The wise men shall be put to shame,
JER.8.9	they shall be dismayed and taken;
JER.8.9	lo, they have rejected the word of the 
JER.8.9	and what wisdom is in them?
JER.8.10	Therefore I will give their wives to others
JER.8.10	and their fields to conquerors,
JER.8.10	because from the least to the greatest
JER.8.10	every one is greedy for unjust gain;
JER.8.10	from prophet to priest
JER.8.10	every one deals falsely.
JER.8.11	They have healed the wound of my people lightly,
JER.8.11	saying, ‘Peace, peace,’
JER.8.11	when there is no peace.
JER.8.12	Were they ashamed when they committed abomination?
JER.8.12	No, they were not at all ashamed;
JER.8.12	they did not know how to blush.
JER.8.12	Therefore they shall fall among the fallen;
JER.8.12	when I punish them, they shall be overthrown,
JER.8.12	says the 
JER.8.13	When I would gather them, says the 
JER.8.13	there are no grapes on the vine,
JER.8.13	nor figs on the fig tree;
JER.8.13	even the leaves are withered,
JER.8.13	and what I gave them has passed away from them.”
JER.8.14	Why do we sit still?
JER.8.14	Gather together, let us go into the fortified cities
JER.8.14	and perish there;
JER.8.14	for the 
JER.8.14	and has given us poisoned water to drink,
JER.8.14	because we have sinned against the 
JER.8.15	We looked for peace, but no good came,
JER.8.15	for a time of healing, but behold, terror.
JER.8.16	“The snorting of their horses is heard from Dan;
JER.8.16	at the sound of the neighing of their stallions
JER.8.16	the whole land quakes.
JER.8.16	They come and devour the land and all that fills it,
JER.8.16	the city and those who dwell in it.
JER.8.17	For behold, I am sending among you serpents,
JER.8.17	adders which cannot be charmed,
JER.8.17	and they shall bite you,”
JER.8.17	says the 
JER.8.18	My grief is beyond healing,
JER.8.18	my heart is sick within me.
JER.8.19	Hark, the cry of the daughter of my people
JER.8.19	from the length and breadth of the land:
JER.8.19	“Is the 
JER.8.19	Is her King not in her?”
JER.8.19	“Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images,
JER.8.19	and with their foreign idols?”
JER.8.20	“The harvest is past, the summer is ended,
JER.8.20	and we are not saved.”
JER.8.21	For the wound of the daughter of my people is my heart wounded,
JER.8.21	I mourn, and dismay has taken hold on me.
JER.8.22	Is there no balm in Gilead?
JER.8.22	Is there no physician there?
JER.8.22	Why then has the health of the daughter of my people
JER.8.22	not been restored?
JER.9.1	and my eyes a fountain of tears,
JER.9.1	that I might weep day and night
JER.9.1	for the slain of the daughter of my people!
JER.9.2	a wayfarers' lodging place,
JER.9.2	that I might leave my people
JER.9.2	and go away from them!
JER.9.2	For they are all adulterers,
JER.9.2	a company of treacherous men.
JER.9.3	They bend their tongue like a bow;
JER.9.3	falsehood and not truth has grown strong
JER.9.3	for they proceed from evil to evil,
JER.9.3	and they do not know me, says the 
JER.9.4	Let every one beware of his neighbor,
JER.9.4	and put no trust in any brother;
JER.9.4	for every brother is a supplanter,
JER.9.4	and every neighbor goes about as a slanderer.
JER.9.5	Every one deceives his neighbor,
JER.9.5	and no one speaks the truth;
JER.9.5	they have taught their tongue to speak lies;
JER.9.5	they commit iniquity and are too weary to repent.
JER.9.6	Heaping oppression upon oppression, and deceit upon deceit,
JER.9.6	they refuse to know me, says the 
JER.9.7	Therefore thus says the 
JER.9.7	“Behold, I will refine them and test them,
JER.9.7	for what else can I do, because of my people?
JER.9.8	Their tongue is a deadly arrow;
JER.9.8	it speaks deceitfully;
JER.9.8	with his mouth each speaks peaceably to his neighbor,
JER.9.8	but in his heart he plans an ambush for him.
JER.9.9	Shall I not punish them for these things? says the 
JER.9.9	and shall I not avenge myself
JER.9.9	on a nation such as this?
JER.9.10	“Take up
JER.9.10	and a lamentation for the pastures of the wilderness,
JER.9.10	because they are laid waste so that no one passes through,
JER.9.10	and the lowing of cattle is not heard;
JER.9.10	both the birds of the air and the beasts have fled and are gone.
JER.9.11	I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins,
JER.9.11	a lair of jackals;
JER.9.11	and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation,
JER.9.11	without inhabitant.”
JER.9.12	Who is the man so wise that he can understand this? To whom has the mouth of the 
JER.9.13	And the 
JER.9.14	but have stubbornly followed their own hearts and have gone after the Baals, as their fathers taught them. 
JER.9.15	Therefore thus says the 
JER.9.16	I will scatter them among the nations whom neither they nor their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them.”
JER.9.17	Thus says the 
JER.9.17	“Consider, and call for the mourning women to come;
JER.9.17	send for the skilful women to come;
JER.9.18	let them make haste and raise a wailing over us,
JER.9.18	that our eyes may run down with tears,
JER.9.18	and our eyelids gush with water.
JER.9.19	For a sound of wailing is heard from Zion:
JER.9.19	‘How we are ruined!
JER.9.19	We are utterly shamed,
JER.9.19	because we have left the land,
JER.9.19	because they have cast down our dwellings.’ ”
JER.9.20	Hear, O women, the word of the 
JER.9.20	and let your ear receive the word of his mouth;
JER.9.20	teach to your daughters a lament,
JER.9.20	and each to her neighbor a dirge.
JER.9.21	For death has come up into our windows,
JER.9.21	it has entered our palaces,
JER.9.21	cutting off the children from the streets
JER.9.21	and the young men from the squares.
JER.9.22	Speak, “Thus says the 
JER.9.22	‘The dead bodies of men shall fall
JER.9.22	like dung upon the open field,
JER.9.22	like sheaves after the reaper,
JER.9.22	and none shall gather them.’ ”
JER.9.23	Thus says the 
JER.9.24	 but let him who glories glory in this, that he understands and knows me, that I am the 
JER.9.25	“Behold, the days are coming, says the 
JER.9.26	 Egypt, Judah, Edom, the sons of Ammon, Moab, and all who dwell in the desert that cut the corners of their hair; for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.”
JER.10.1	Hear the word which the 
JER.10.1	speaks to you, O house of Israel. 
JER.10.2	Thus says the 
JER.10.2	“Learn not the way of the nations,
JER.10.2	nor be dismayed at the signs of the heavens
JER.10.2	because the nations are dismayed at them,
JER.10.3	for the customs of the peoples are false.
JER.10.3	A tree from the forest is cut down,
JER.10.3	and worked with an axe by the hands of a craftsman.
JER.10.4	Men deck it with silver and gold;
JER.10.4	they fasten it with hammer and nails
JER.10.4	so that it cannot move.
JER.10.5	Their idols
JER.10.5	and they cannot speak;
JER.10.5	they have to be carried,
JER.10.5	for they cannot walk.
JER.10.5	Be not afraid of them,
JER.10.5	for they cannot do evil,
JER.10.5	neither is it in them to do good.”
JER.10.6	There is none like thee, O 
JER.10.6	thou art great, and thy name is great in might.
JER.10.7	Who would not fear thee, O King of the nations?
JER.10.7	For this is thy due;
JER.10.7	for among all the wise ones of the nations
JER.10.7	and in all their kingdoms
JER.10.7	there is none like thee.
JER.10.8	They are both stupid and foolish;
JER.10.8	the instruction of idols is but wood!
JER.10.9	Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish,
JER.10.9	and gold from Uphaz.
JER.10.9	They are the work of the craftsman and of the hands of the goldsmith;
JER.10.9	their clothing is violet and purple;
JER.10.9	they are all the work of skilled men.
JER.10.10	But the 
JER.10.10	he is the living God and the everlasting King.
JER.10.10	At his wrath the earth quakes,
JER.10.10	and the nations cannot endure his indignation.
JER.10.11	Thus shall you say to them: “The gods who did not make the heavens and the earth shall perish from the earth and from under the heavens.”
JER.10.12	It is he who made the earth by his power,
JER.10.12	who established the world by his wisdom,
JER.10.12	and by his understanding stretched out the heavens.
JER.10.13	When he utters his voice there is a tumult of waters in the heavens,
JER.10.13	and he makes the mist rise from the ends of the earth.
JER.10.13	He makes lightnings for the rain,
JER.10.13	and he brings forth the wind from his storehouses.
JER.10.14	Every man is stupid and without knowledge;
JER.10.14	every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols;
JER.10.14	for his images are false,
JER.10.14	and there is no breath in them.
JER.10.15	They are worthless, a work of delusion;
JER.10.15	at the time of their punishment they shall perish.
JER.10.16	Not like these is he who is the portion of Jacob,
JER.10.16	for he is the one who formed all things,
JER.10.16	and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance;
JER.10.16	the 
JER.10.17	Gather up your bundle from the ground,
JER.10.17	O you who dwell under siege!
JER.10.18	For thus says the 
JER.10.18	“Behold, I am slinging out the inhabitants of the land
JER.10.18	at this time,
JER.10.18	and I will bring distress on them,
JER.10.18	that they may feel it.”
JER.10.19	Woe is me because of my hurt!
JER.10.19	My wound is grievous.
JER.10.19	But I said, “Truly this is an affliction,
JER.10.19	and I must bear it.”
JER.10.20	My tent is destroyed,
JER.10.20	and all my cords are broken;
JER.10.20	my children have gone from me,
JER.10.20	and they are not;
JER.10.20	there is no one to spread my tent again,
JER.10.20	and to set up my curtains.
JER.10.21	For the shepherds are stupid,
JER.10.21	and do not inquire of the 
JER.10.21	therefore they have not prospered,
JER.10.21	and all their flock is scattered.
JER.10.22	Hark, a rumor! Behold, it comes!—
JER.10.22	a great commotion out of the north country
JER.10.22	to make the cities of Judah a desolation,
JER.10.22	a lair of jackals.
JER.10.23	I know, O 
JER.10.23	that it is not in man who walks to direct his steps.
JER.10.24	Correct me, O 
JER.10.24	not in thy anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.
JER.10.25	and upon the peoples that call not on thy name;
JER.10.25	for they have devoured Jacob;
JER.10.25	they have devoured him and consumed him,
JER.10.25	and have laid waste his habitation.
JER.11.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.11.2	“Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
JER.11.3	You shall say to them, Thus says the 
JER.11.4	which I commanded your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Listen to my voice, and do all that I command you. So shall you be my people, and I will be your God, 
JER.11.5	that I may perform the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day.” Then I answered, “So be it, 
JER.11.6	And the 
JER.11.7	For I solemnly warned your fathers when I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, warning them persistently, even to this day, saying, Obey my voice. 
JER.11.8	Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but every one walked in the stubbornness of his evil heart. Therefore I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did not.”
JER.11.9	Again the 
JER.11.10	They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words; they have gone after other gods to serve them; the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers. 
JER.11.11	Therefore, thus says the 
JER.11.12	Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they cannot save them in the time of their trouble. 
JER.11.13	For your gods have become as many as your cities, O Judah; and as many as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to shame, altars to burn incense to Baal.
JER.11.14	“Therefore do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer on their behalf, for I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their trouble. 
JER.11.15	What right has my beloved in my house, when she has done vile deeds? Can vows
JER.11.16	The 
JER.11.17	The 
JER.11.18	The 
JER.11.18	then thou didst show me their evil deeds.
JER.11.19	But I was like a gentle lamb
JER.11.19	led to the slaughter.
JER.11.19	I did not know it was against me
JER.11.19	they devised schemes, saying,
JER.11.19	“Let us destroy the tree with its fruit,
JER.11.19	let us cut him off from the land of the living,
JER.11.19	that his name be remembered no more.”
JER.11.20	But, O 
JER.11.20	who tries the heart and the mind,
JER.11.20	let me see thy vengeance upon them,
JER.11.20	for to thee have I committed my cause.
JER.11.21	Therefore thus says the 
JER.11.22	therefore thus says the 
JER.11.23	and none of them shall be left. For I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, the year of their punishment.”
JER.12.1	Righteous art thou, O 
JER.12.1	when I complain to thee;
JER.12.1	yet I would plead my case before thee.
JER.12.1	Why does the way of the wicked prosper?
JER.12.1	Why do all who are treacherous thrive?
JER.12.2	Thou plantest them, and they take root;
JER.12.2	they grow and bring forth fruit;
JER.12.2	thou art near in their mouth
JER.12.2	and far from their heart.
JER.12.3	But thou, O 
JER.12.3	thou seest me, and triest my mind toward thee.
JER.12.3	Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter,
JER.12.3	and set them apart for the day of slaughter.
JER.12.4	How long will the land mourn,
JER.12.4	and the grass of every field wither?
JER.12.4	For the wickedness of those who dwell in it
JER.12.4	the beasts and the birds are swept away,
JER.12.4	because men said, “He will not see our latter end.”
JER.12.5	“If you have raced with men on foot, and they have wearied you,
JER.12.5	how will you compete with horses?
JER.12.5	And if in a safe land you fall down,
JER.12.5	how will you do in the jungle of the Jordan?
JER.12.6	For even your brothers and the house of your father,
JER.12.6	even they have dealt treacherously with you;
JER.12.6	they are in full cry after you;
JER.12.6	believe them not,
JER.12.6	though they speak fair words to you.”
JER.12.7	“I have forsaken my house,
JER.12.7	I have abandoned my heritage;
JER.12.7	I have given the beloved of my soul
JER.12.7	into the hands of her enemies.
JER.12.8	My heritage has become to me
JER.12.8	like a lion in the forest,
JER.12.8	she has lifted up her voice against me;
JER.12.8	therefore I hate her.
JER.12.9	Is my heritage to me like a speckled bird of prey?
JER.12.9	Are the birds of prey against her round about?
JER.12.9	Go, assemble all the wild beasts;
JER.12.9	bring them to devour.
JER.12.10	Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard,
JER.12.10	they have trampled down my portion,
JER.12.10	they have made my pleasant portion
JER.12.10	a desolate wilderness.
JER.12.11	They have made it a desolation;
JER.12.11	desolate, it mourns to me.
JER.12.11	The whole land is made desolate,
JER.12.11	but no man lays it to heart.
JER.12.12	Upon all the bare heights in the desert
JER.12.12	destroyers have come;
JER.12.12	for the sword of the 
JER.12.12	from one end of the land to the other;
JER.12.12	no flesh has peace.
JER.12.13	They have sown wheat and have reaped thorns,
JER.12.13	they have tired themselves out but profit nothing.
JER.12.13	They shall be ashamed of their
JER.12.13	because of the fierce anger of the 
JER.12.14	Thus says the 
JER.12.15	And after I have plucked them up, I will again have compassion on them, and I will bring them again each to his heritage and each to his land. 
JER.12.16	And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, ‘As the 
JER.12.17	But if any nation will not listen, then I will utterly pluck it up and destroy it, says the 
JER.13.1	Thus says the 
JER.13.2	So I bought a waistcloth according to the word of the 
JER.13.3	And the word of the 
JER.13.4	“Take the waistcloth which you have bought, which is upon your loins, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.” 
JER.13.5	So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as the 
JER.13.6	And after many days the 
JER.13.7	Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and I took the waistcloth from the place where I had hidden it. And behold, the waistcloth was spoiled; it was good for nothing.
JER.13.8	Then the word of the 
JER.13.9	“Thus says the 
JER.13.10	This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who stubbornly follow their own heart and have gone after other gods to serve them and worship them, shall be like this waistcloth, which is good for nothing. 
JER.13.11	For as the waistcloth clings to the loins of a man, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me, says the 
JER.13.12	“You shall speak to them this word: ‘Thus says the 
JER.13.13	Then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the 
JER.13.14	And I will dash them one against another, fathers and sons together, says the 
JER.13.15	Hear and give ear; be not proud,
JER.13.15	for the 
JER.13.16	Give glory to the 
JER.13.16	before he brings darkness,
JER.13.16	before your feet stumble
JER.13.16	on the twilight mountains,
JER.13.16	and while you look for light
JER.13.16	he turns it into gloom
JER.13.16	and makes it deep darkness.
JER.13.17	But if you will not listen,
JER.13.17	my soul will weep in secret for your pride;
JER.13.17	my eyes will weep bitterly and run down with tears,
JER.13.17	because the 
JER.13.18	Say to the king and the queen mother:
JER.13.18	“Take a lowly seat,
JER.13.18	for your beautiful crown
JER.13.18	has come down from your head.”
JER.13.19	The cities of the Negeb are shut up,
JER.13.19	with none to open them;
JER.13.19	all Judah is taken into exile,
JER.13.19	wholly taken into exile.
JER.13.20	“Lift up your eyes and see
JER.13.20	those who come from the north.
JER.13.20	Where is the flock that was given you,
JER.13.20	your beautiful flock?
JER.13.21	What will you say when they set as head over you
JER.13.21	those whom you yourself have taught
JER.13.21	to be friends to you?
JER.13.21	Will not pangs take hold of you,
JER.13.21	like those of a woman in travail?
JER.13.22	And if you say in your heart,
JER.13.22	‘Why have these things come upon me?’
JER.13.22	it is for the greatness of your iniquity
JER.13.22	that your skirts are lifted up,
JER.13.22	and you suffer violence.
JER.13.23	Can the Ethiopian change his skin
JER.13.23	or the leopard his spots?
JER.13.23	Then also you can do good
JER.13.23	who are accustomed to do evil.
JER.13.24	I will scatter you
JER.13.24	driven by the wind from the desert.
JER.13.25	This is your lot,
JER.13.25	the portion I have measured out to you, says the 
JER.13.25	because you have forgotten me
JER.13.25	and trusted in lies.
JER.13.26	I myself will lift up your skirts over your face,
JER.13.26	and your shame will be seen.
JER.13.27	I have seen your abominations,
JER.13.27	your adulteries and neighings, your lewd harlotries,
JER.13.27	on the hills in the field.
JER.13.27	Woe to you, O Jerusalem!
JER.13.27	How long will it be
JER.13.27	before you are made clean?”
JER.14.1	The word of the 
JER.14.2	“Judah mourns
JER.14.2	and her gates languish;
JER.14.2	her people lament on the ground,
JER.14.2	and the cry of Jerusalem goes up.
JER.14.3	Her nobles send their servants for water;
JER.14.3	they come to the cisterns,
JER.14.3	they find no water,
JER.14.3	they return with their vessels empty;
JER.14.3	they are ashamed and confounded
JER.14.3	and cover their heads.
JER.14.4	Because of the ground which is dismayed,
JER.14.4	since there is no rain on the land,
JER.14.4	the farmers are ashamed,
JER.14.4	they cover their heads.
JER.14.5	Even the hind in the field forsakes her newborn calf
JER.14.5	because there is no grass.
JER.14.6	The wild asses stand on the bare heights,
JER.14.6	they pant for air like jackals;
JER.14.6	their eyes fail
JER.14.6	because there is no herbage.
JER.14.7	“Though our iniquities testify against us,
JER.14.7	act, O 
JER.14.7	for our backslidings are many,
JER.14.7	we have sinned against thee.
JER.14.8	O thou hope of Israel,
JER.14.8	its savior in time of trouble,
JER.14.8	why shouldst thou be like a stranger in the land,
JER.14.8	like a wayfarer who turns aside to tarry for a night?
JER.14.9	Why shouldst thou be like a man confused,
JER.14.9	like a mighty man who cannot save?
JER.14.9	Yet thou, O 
JER.14.9	and we are called by thy name;
JER.14.9	leave us not.”
JER.14.10	Thus says the 
JER.14.10	“They have loved to wander thus,
JER.14.10	they have not restrained their feet;
JER.14.10	therefore the 
JER.14.10	now he will remember their iniquity
JER.14.10	and punish their sins.”
JER.14.11	The 
JER.14.12	 Though they fast, I will not hear their cry, and though they offer burnt offering and cereal offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.”
JER.14.13	Then I said: “Ah, Lord 
JER.14.14	And the 
JER.14.15	Therefore thus says the 
JER.14.16	And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem, victims of famine and sword, with none to bury them—them, their wives, their sons, and their daughters. For I will pour out their wickedness upon them.
JER.14.17	“You shall say to them this word:
JER.14.17	‘Let my eyes run down with tears night and day,
JER.14.17	and let them not cease,
JER.14.17	for the virgin daughter of my people is smitten with a great wound,
JER.14.17	with a very grievous blow.
JER.14.18	If I go out into the field,
JER.14.18	behold, those slain by the sword!
JER.14.18	And if I enter the city,
JER.14.18	behold, the diseases of famine!
JER.14.18	For both prophet and priest ply their trade through the land,
JER.14.18	and have no knowledge.’ ”
JER.14.19	Hast thou utterly rejected Judah?
JER.14.19	Does thy soul loathe Zion?
JER.14.19	Why hast thou smitten us
JER.14.19	so that there is no healing for us?
JER.14.19	We looked for peace, but no good came;
JER.14.19	for a time of healing, but behold, terror.
JER.14.20	We acknowledge our wickedness, O 
JER.14.20	and the iniquity of our fathers,
JER.14.20	for we have sinned against thee.
JER.14.21	Do not spurn us, for thy name's sake;
JER.14.21	do no dishonor thy glorious throne;
JER.14.21	remember and do not break thy covenant with us.
JER.14.22	Are there any among the false gods of the nations that can bring rain?
JER.14.22	Or can the heavens give showers?
JER.14.22	Art thou not he, O 
JER.14.22	We set our hope on thee,
JER.14.22	for thou doest all these things.
JER.15.1	Then the 
JER.15.2	 And when they ask you, ‘Where shall we go?’ you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the 
JER.15.2	“Those who are for pestilence, to pestilence,
JER.15.2	and those who are for the sword, to the sword;
JER.15.2	those who are for famine, to famine,
JER.15.2	and those who are for captivity, to captivity.” ’
JER.15.3	“I will appoint over them four kinds of destroyers, says the 
JER.15.4	And I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what Manasseh the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem.
JER.15.5	“Who will have pity on you, O Jerusalem,
JER.15.5	or who will bemoan you?
JER.15.5	Who will turn aside
JER.15.5	to ask about your welfare?
JER.15.6	You have rejected me, says the 
JER.15.6	you keep going backward;
JER.15.6	so I have stretched out my hand against you and destroyed you;—
JER.15.6	I am weary of relenting.
JER.15.7	I have winnowed them with a winnowing fork
JER.15.7	in the gates of the land;
JER.15.7	I have bereaved them, I have destroyed my people;
JER.15.7	they did not turn from their ways.
JER.15.8	I have made their widows more in number
JER.15.8	than the sand of the seas;
JER.15.8	I have brought against the mothers of young men
JER.15.8	a destroyer at noonday;
JER.15.8	I have made anguish and terror
JER.15.8	fall upon them suddenly.
JER.15.9	She who bore seven has languished;
JER.15.9	she has swooned away;
JER.15.9	her sun went down while it was yet day;
JER.15.9	she has been shamed and disgraced.
JER.15.9	And the rest of them I will give to the sword
JER.15.9	before their enemies,
JER.15.9	says the 
JER.15.10	Woe is me, my mother, that you bore me, a man of strife and contention to the whole land! I have not lent, nor have I borrowed, yet all of them curse me. 
JER.15.11	So let it be, O 
JER.15.12	Can one break iron, iron from the north, and bronze?
JER.15.13	“Your wealth and your treasures I will give as spoil, without price, for all your sins, throughout all your territory. 
JER.15.14	I will make you serve your enemies in a land which you do not know, for in my anger a fire is kindled which shall burn for ever.”
JER.15.15	O 
JER.15.15	remember me and visit me,
JER.15.15	and take vengeance for me on my persecutors.
JER.15.15	In thy forbearance take me not away;
JER.15.15	know that for thy sake I bear reproach.
JER.15.16	Thy words were found, and I ate them,
JER.15.16	and thy words became to me a joy
JER.15.16	and the delight of my heart;
JER.15.16	for I am called by thy name,
JER.15.16	O 
JER.15.17	I did not sit in the company of merrymakers,
JER.15.17	nor did I rejoice;
JER.15.17	I sat alone, because thy hand was upon me,
JER.15.17	for thou hadst filled me with indignation.
JER.15.18	Why is my pain unceasing,
JER.15.18	my wound incurable,
JER.15.18	refusing to be healed?
JER.15.18	Wilt thou be to me like a deceitful brook,
JER.15.18	like waters that fail?
JER.15.19	Therefore thus says the 
JER.15.19	“If you return, I will restore you,
JER.15.19	and you shall stand before me.
JER.15.19	If you utter what is precious, and not what is worthless,
JER.15.19	you shall be as my mouth.
JER.15.19	They shall turn to you,
JER.15.19	but you shall not turn to them.
JER.15.20	And I will make you to this people
JER.15.20	a fortified wall of bronze;
JER.15.20	they will fight against you,
JER.15.20	but they shall not prevail over you,
JER.15.20	for I am with you
JER.15.20	to save you and deliver you,
JER.15.20	says the 
JER.15.21	“I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked,
JER.15.21	and redeem you from the grasp of the ruthless.”
JER.16.1	The word of the 
JER.16.2	“You shall not take a wife, nor shall you have sons or daughters in this place. 
JER.16.3	For thus says the 
JER.16.4	They shall die of deadly diseases. They shall not be lamented, nor shall they be buried; they shall be as dung on the surface of the ground. They shall perish by the sword and by famine, and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air and for the beasts of the earth.
JER.16.5	“For thus says the 
JER.16.6	Both great and small shall die in this land; they shall not be buried, and no one shall lament for them or cut himself or make himself bald for them. 
JER.16.7	No one shall break bread for the mourner, to comfort him for the dead; nor shall any one give him the cup of consolation to drink for his father or his mother. 
JER.16.8	You shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and drink. 
JER.16.9	 For thus says the 
JER.16.10	“And when you tell this people all these words, and they say to you, ‘Why has the 
JER.16.11	then you shall say to them: ‘Because your fathers have forsaken me, says the 
JER.16.12	and because you have done worse than your fathers, for behold, every one of you follows his stubborn evil will, refusing to listen to me; 
JER.16.13	therefore I will hurl you out of this land into a land which neither you nor your fathers have known, and there you shall serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.’
JER.16.14	“Therefore, behold, the days are coming, says the 
JER.16.15	but ‘As the 
JER.16.16	“Behold, I am sending for many fishers, says the 
JER.16.17	For my eyes are upon all their ways; they are not hid from me, nor is their iniquity concealed from my eyes. 
JER.16.18	And
JER.16.19	O 
JER.16.19	my refuge in the day of trouble,
JER.16.19	to thee shall the nations come
JER.16.19	from the ends of the earth and say:
JER.16.19	“Our fathers have inherited naught but lies,
JER.16.19	worthless things in which there is no profit.
JER.16.20	Can man make for himself gods?
JER.16.20	Such are no gods!”
JER.16.21	“Therefore, behold, I will make them know, this once I will make them know my power and my might, and they shall know that my name is the 
JER.17.1	“The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron; with a point of diamond it is engraved on the tablet of their heart, and on the horns of their altars, 
JER.17.2	while their children remember their altars and their Asherim, beside every green tree, and on the high hills, 
JER.17.3	on the mountains in the open country. Your wealth and all your treasures I will give for spoil as the price of your sin
JER.17.4	You shall loosen your hand
JER.17.5	Thus says the 
JER.17.5	“Cursed is the man who trusts in man
JER.17.5	and makes flesh his arm,
JER.17.5	whose heart turns away from the 
JER.17.6	He is like a shrub in the desert,
JER.17.6	and shall not see any good come.
JER.17.6	He shall dwell in the parched places of the wilderness,
JER.17.6	in an uninhabited salt land.
JER.17.7	whose trust is the 
JER.17.8	He is like a tree planted by water,
JER.17.8	that sends out its roots by the stream,
JER.17.8	and does not fear when heat comes,
JER.17.8	for its leaves remain green,
JER.17.8	and is not anxious in the year of drought,
JER.17.8	for it does not cease to bear fruit.”
JER.17.9	The heart is deceitful above all things,
JER.17.9	and desperately corrupt;
JER.17.9	who can understand it?
JER.17.10	and try the heart,
JER.17.10	to give every man according to his ways,
JER.17.10	according to the fruit of his doings.”
JER.17.11	Like the partridge that gathers a brood which she did not hatch,
JER.17.11	so is he who gets riches but not by right;
JER.17.11	in the midst of his days they will leave him,
JER.17.11	and at his end he will be a fool.
JER.17.12	A glorious throne set on high from the beginning
JER.17.12	is the place of our sanctuary.
JER.17.13	O 
JER.17.13	all who forsake thee shall be put to shame;
JER.17.13	those who turn away from thee
JER.17.13	for they have forsaken the 
JER.17.14	Heal me, O 
JER.17.14	save me, and I shall be saved;
JER.17.14	for thou art my praise.
JER.17.15	Behold, they say to me,
JER.17.15	“Where is the word of the 
JER.17.15	Let it come!”
JER.17.16	I have not pressed thee to send evil,
JER.17.16	nor have I desired the day of disaster,
JER.17.16	thou knowest;
JER.17.16	that which came out of my lips
JER.17.16	was before thy face.
JER.17.17	Be not a terror to me;
JER.17.17	thou art my refuge in the day of evil.
JER.17.18	Let those be put to shame who persecute me,
JER.17.18	but let me not be put to shame;
JER.17.18	let them be dismayed,
JER.17.18	but let me not be dismayed;
JER.17.18	bring upon them the day of evil;
JER.17.18	destroy them with double destruction!
JER.17.19	Thus said the 
JER.17.20	and say: ‘Hear the word of the 
JER.17.21	Thus says the 
JER.17.22	And do not carry a burden out of your houses on the sabbath or do any work, but keep the sabbath day holy, as I commanded your fathers. 
JER.17.23	Yet they did not listen or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck, that they might not hear and receive instruction.
JER.17.24	“ ‘But if you listen to me, says the 
JER.17.25	then there shall enter by the gates of this city kings
JER.17.26	And people shall come from the cities of Judah and the places round about Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, from the Shephelah, from the hill country, and from the Negeb, bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, cereal offerings and frankincense, and bringing thank offerings to the house of the 
JER.17.27	But if you do not listen to me, to keep the sabbath day holy, and not to bear a burden and enter by the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in its gates, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem and shall not be quenched.’ ”
JER.18.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.18.2	“Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will let you hear my words.” 
JER.18.3	So I went down to the potter's house, and there he was working at his wheel. 
JER.18.4	And the vessel he was making of clay was spoiled in the potter's hand, and he reworked it into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to do.
JER.18.5	Then the word of the 
JER.18.6	 “O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter has done? says the 
JER.18.7	If at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it, 
JER.18.8	and if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from its evil, I will repent of the evil that I intended to do to it. 
JER.18.9	And if at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will build and plant it, 
JER.18.10	and if it does evil in my sight, not listening to my voice, then I will repent of the good which I had intended to do to it. 
JER.18.11	Now, therefore, say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: ‘Thus says the 
JER.18.12	“But they say, ‘That is in vain! We will follow our own plans, and will every one act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.’
JER.18.13	“Therefore thus says the 
JER.18.13	Ask among the nations,
JER.18.13	who has heard the like of this?
JER.18.13	The virgin Israel
JER.18.13	has done a very horrible thing.
JER.18.14	Does the snow of Lebanon leave
JER.18.14	the crags of Sirion?
JER.18.14	Do the mountain
JER.18.14	the cold flowing streams?
JER.18.15	But my people have forgotten me,
JER.18.15	they burn incense to false gods;
JER.18.15	they have stumbled
JER.18.15	in the ancient roads,
JER.18.15	and have gone into bypaths,
JER.18.15	not the highway,
JER.18.16	making their land a horror,
JER.18.16	a thing to be hissed at for ever.
JER.18.16	Every one who passes by it is horrified
JER.18.16	and shakes his head.
JER.18.17	Like the east wind I will scatter them
JER.18.17	before the enemy.
JER.18.17	I will show them my back, not my face,
JER.18.17	in the day of their calamity.”
JER.18.18	Then they said, “Come, let us make plots against Jeremiah, for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not heed any of his words.”
JER.18.19	Give heed to me, O 
JER.18.19	and hearken to my plea.
JER.18.20	Is evil a recompense for good?
JER.18.20	Yet they have dug a pit for my life.
JER.18.20	Remember how I stood before thee
JER.18.20	to speak good for them,
JER.18.20	to turn away thy wrath from them.
JER.18.21	Therefore deliver up their children to famine;
JER.18.21	give them over to the power of the sword,
JER.18.21	let their wives become childless and widowed.
JER.18.21	May their men meet death by pestilence,
JER.18.21	their youths be slain by the sword in battle.
JER.18.22	May a cry be heard from their houses,
JER.18.22	when thou bringest the marauder suddenly upon them!
JER.18.22	For they have dug a pit to take me,
JER.18.22	and laid snares for my feet.
JER.18.23	Yet, thou, O 
JER.18.23	all their plotting to slay me.
JER.18.23	Forgive not their iniquity,
JER.18.23	nor blot out their sin from thy sight.
JER.18.23	Let them be overthrown before thee;
JER.18.23	deal with them in the time of thine anger.
JER.19.1	Thus said the 
JER.19.2	and go out to the valley of the son of Hinnom at the entry of the Potsherd Gate, and proclaim there the words that I tell you. 
JER.19.3	You shall say, ‘Hear the word of the 
JER.19.4	Because the people have forsaken me, and have profaned this place by burning incense in it to other gods whom neither they nor their fathers nor the kings of Judah have known; and because they have filled this place with the blood of innocents, 
JER.19.5	and have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, which I did not command or decree, nor did it come into my mind; 
JER.19.6	therefore, behold, days are coming, says the 
JER.19.7	And in this place I will make void the plans of Judah and Jerusalem, and will cause their people to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life. I will give their dead bodies for food to the birds of the air and to the beasts of the earth. 
JER.19.8	And I will make this city a horror, a thing to be hissed at; every one who passes by it will be horrified and will hiss because of all its disasters. 
JER.19.9	And I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and their daughters, and every one shall eat the flesh of his neighbor in the siege and in the distress, with which their enemies and those who seek their life afflict them.’
JER.19.10	“Then you shall break the flask in the sight of the men who go with you, 
JER.19.11	and shall say to them, ‘Thus says the 
JER.19.12	Thus will I do to this place, says the 
JER.19.13	 The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah—all the houses upon whose roofs incense has been burned to all the host of heaven, and drink offerings have been poured out to other gods—shall be defiled like the place of Topheth.’ ”
JER.19.14	Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where the 
JER.19.15	“Thus says the 
JER.20.1	Now Pashhur the priest, the son of Immer, who was chief officer in the house of the 
JER.20.2	Then Pashhur beat Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper Benjamin Gate of the house of the 
JER.20.3	 On the morrow, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “The 
JER.20.4	For thus says the 
JER.20.5	Moreover, I will give all the wealth of the city, all its gains, all its prized belongings, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies, who shall plunder them, and seize them, and carry them to Babylon. 
JER.20.6	And you, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house, shall go into captivity; to Babylon you shall go; and there you shall die, and there you shall be buried, you and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsely.”
JER.20.7	O 
JER.20.7	and I was deceived;
JER.20.7	thou art stronger than I,
JER.20.7	and thou hast prevailed.
JER.20.7	I have become a laughingstock all the day;
JER.20.7	every one mocks me.
JER.20.8	For whenever I speak, I cry out,
JER.20.8	I shout, “Violence and destruction!”
JER.20.8	For the word of the 
JER.20.8	a reproach and derision all day long.
JER.20.9	If I say, “I will not mention him,
JER.20.9	or speak any more in his name,”
JER.20.9	there is in my heart as it were a burning fire
JER.20.9	shut up in my bones,
JER.20.9	and I am weary with holding it in,
JER.20.9	and I cannot.
JER.20.10	For I hear many whispering.
JER.20.10	Terror is on every side!
JER.20.10	“Denounce him! Let us denounce him!”
JER.20.10	say all my familiar friends,
JER.20.10	watching for my fall.
JER.20.10	“Perhaps he will be deceived,
JER.20.10	then we can overcome him,
JER.20.10	and take our revenge on him.”
JER.20.11	But the 
JER.20.11	therefore my persecutors will stumble,
JER.20.11	they will not overcome me.
JER.20.11	They will be greatly shamed,
JER.20.11	for they will not succeed.
JER.20.11	Their eternal dishonor
JER.20.11	will never be forgotten.
JER.20.12	O 
JER.20.12	who seest the heart and the mind,
JER.20.12	let me see thy vengeance upon them,
JER.20.12	for to thee have I committed my cause.
JER.20.13	Sing to the 
JER.20.13	praise the 
JER.20.13	For he has delivered the life of the needy
JER.20.13	from the hand of evildoers.
JER.20.14	on which I was born!
JER.20.14	The day when my mother bore me,
JER.20.14	let it not be blessed!
JER.20.15	Cursed be the man
JER.20.15	who brought the news to my father,
JER.20.15	“A son is born to you,”
JER.20.15	making him very glad.
JER.20.16	Let that man be like the cities
JER.20.16	which the 
JER.20.16	let him hear a cry in the morning
JER.20.16	and an alarm at noon,
JER.20.17	because he did not kill me in the womb;
JER.20.17	so my mother would have been my grave,
JER.20.17	and her womb for ever great.
JER.20.18	Why did I come forth from the womb
JER.20.18	to see toil and sorrow,
JER.20.18	and spend my days in shame?
JER.21.1	This is the word which came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.21.2	“Inquire of the 
JER.21.3	Then Jeremiah said to them: 
JER.21.4	“Thus you shall say to Zedekiah, ‘Thus says the 
JER.21.5	I myself will fight against you with outstretched hand and strong arm, in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath. 
JER.21.6	And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; they shall die of a great pestilence. 
JER.21.7	Afterward, says the 
JER.21.8	“And to this people you shall say: ‘Thus says the 
JER.21.9	He who stays in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence; but he who goes out and surrenders to the Chaldeans who are besieging you shall live and shall have his life as a prize of war. 
JER.21.10	For I have set my face against this city for evil and not for good, says the 
JER.21.11	“And to the house of the king of Judah say, ‘Hear the word of the 
JER.21.12	O house of David! Thus says the 
JER.21.12	“ ‘Execute justice in the morning,
JER.21.12	and deliver from the hand of the oppressor
JER.21.12	him who has been robbed,
JER.21.12	lest my wrath go forth like fire,
JER.21.12	and burn with none to quench it,
JER.21.12	because of your evil doings.’ ”
JER.21.13	“Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley,
JER.21.13	O rock of the plain,
JER.21.13	says the 
JER.21.13	you who say, ‘Who shall come down against us,
JER.21.13	or who shall enter our habitations?’
JER.21.14	I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings,
JER.21.14	says the 
JER.21.14	I will kindle a fire in her forest,
JER.21.14	and it shall devour all that is round about her.”
JER.22.1	Thus says the 
JER.22.2	and say, ‘Hear the word of the 
JER.22.3	Thus says the 
JER.22.4	For if you will indeed obey this word, then there shall enter the gates of this house kings who sit on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their servants, and their people. 
JER.22.5	 But if you will not heed these words, I swear by myself, says the 
JER.22.6	For thus says the 
JER.22.6	“ ‘You are as Gilead to me,
JER.22.6	as the summit of Lebanon,
JER.22.6	yet surely I will make you a desert,
JER.22.6	an uninhabited city.
JER.22.7	I will prepare destroyers against you,
JER.22.7	each with his weapons;
JER.22.7	and they shall cut down your choicest cedars,
JER.22.7	and cast them into the fire.
JER.22.8	“ ‘And many nations will pass by this city, and every man will say to his neighbor, “Why has the 
JER.22.9	And they will answer, “Because they forsook the covenant of the 
JER.22.10	Weep not for him who is dead,
JER.22.10	nor bemoan him;
JER.22.10	but weep bitterly for him who goes away,
JER.22.10	for he shall return no more
JER.22.10	to see his native land.
JER.22.11	For thus says the 
JER.22.12	but in the place where they have carried him captive, there shall he die, and he shall never see this land again.”
JER.22.13	“Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness,
JER.22.13	and his upper rooms by injustice;
JER.22.13	who makes his neighbor serve him for nothing,
JER.22.13	and does not give him his wages;
JER.22.14	who says, ‘I will build myself a great house
JER.22.14	with spacious upper rooms,’
JER.22.14	and cuts out windows for it,
JER.22.14	paneling it with cedar,
JER.22.14	and painting it with vermilion.
JER.22.15	Do you think you are a king
JER.22.15	because you compete in cedar?
JER.22.15	Did not your father eat and drink
JER.22.15	and do justice and righteousness?
JER.22.15	Then it was well with him.
JER.22.16	He judged the cause of the poor and needy;
JER.22.16	then it was well.
JER.22.16	Is not this to know me?
JER.22.16	says the 
JER.22.17	But you have eyes and heart
JER.22.17	only for your dishonest gain,
JER.22.17	for shedding innocent blood,
JER.22.17	and for practicing oppression and violence.”
JER.22.18	Therefore thus says the 
JER.22.18	“They shall not lament for him, saying,
JER.22.18	‘Ah my brother!’ or ‘Ah sister!’
JER.22.18	They shall not lament for him, saying,
JER.22.18	‘Ah lord!’ or ‘Ah his majesty!’
JER.22.19	With the burial of an ass he shall be buried,
JER.22.19	dragged and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.”
JER.22.20	“Go up to Lebanon, and cry out,
JER.22.20	and lift up your voice in Bashan;
JER.22.20	cry from Abarim,
JER.22.20	for all your lovers are destroyed.
JER.22.21	I spoke to you in your prosperity,
JER.22.21	but you said, ‘I will not listen.’
JER.22.21	This has been your way from your youth,
JER.22.21	that you have not obeyed my voice.
JER.22.22	The wind shall shepherd all your shepherds,
JER.22.22	and your lovers shall go into captivity;
JER.22.22	then you will be ashamed and confounded
JER.22.22	because of all your wickedness.
JER.22.23	O inhabitant of Lebanon,
JER.22.23	nested among the cedars,
JER.22.23	how you will groan
JER.22.23	pain as of a woman in travail!”
JER.22.24	“As I live, says the 
JER.22.25	and give you into the hand of those who seek your life, into the hand of those of whom you are afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans. 
JER.22.26	I will hurl you and the mother who bore you into another country, where you were not born, and there you shall die. 
JER.22.27	But to the land to which they will long to return, there they shall not return.”
JER.22.28	Is this man Coniah a despised, broken pot,
JER.22.28	a vessel no one cares for?
JER.22.28	Why are he and his children hurled and cast
JER.22.28	into a land which they do not know?
JER.22.29	O land, land, land,
JER.22.29	hear the word of the 
JER.22.30	Thus says the 
JER.22.30	“Write this man down as childless,
JER.22.30	a man who shall not succeed in his days;
JER.22.30	for none of his offspring shall succeed
JER.22.30	in sitting on the throne of David,
JER.22.30	and ruling again in Judah.”
JER.23.1	“Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!” says the 
JER.23.2	Therefore thus says the 
JER.23.3	Then I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply. 
JER.23.4	I will set shepherds over them who will care for them, and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be missing, says the 
JER.23.6	In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. And this is the name by which he will be called: ‘The 
JER.23.7	“Therefore, behold, the days are coming, says the 
JER.23.8	but ‘As the 
JER.23.9	Concerning the prophets:
JER.23.9	My heart is broken within me,
JER.23.9	all my bones shake;
JER.23.9	I am like a drunken man,
JER.23.9	like a man overcome by wine,
JER.23.9	because of the 
JER.23.9	and because of his holy words.
JER.23.10	For the land is full of adulterers;
JER.23.10	because of the curse the land mourns,
JER.23.10	and the pastures of the wilderness are dried up.
JER.23.10	Their course is evil,
JER.23.10	and their might is not right.
JER.23.11	“Both prophet and priest are ungodly;
JER.23.11	even in my house I have found their wickedness,
JER.23.11	says the 
JER.23.12	Therefore their way shall be to them
JER.23.12	like slippery paths in the darkness,
JER.23.12	into which they shall be driven and fall;
JER.23.12	for I will bring evil upon them
JER.23.12	in the year of their punishment,
JER.23.12	says the 
JER.23.13	In the prophets of Samaria
JER.23.13	I saw an unsavory thing:
JER.23.13	they prophesied by Baal
JER.23.13	and led my people Israel astray.
JER.23.14	But in the prophets of Jerusalem
JER.23.14	I have seen a horrible thing:
JER.23.14	they commit adultery and walk in lies;
JER.23.14	they strengthen the hands of evildoers,
JER.23.14	so that no one turns from his wickedness;
JER.23.14	all of them have become like Sodom to me,
JER.23.14	and its inhabitants like Gomorrah.”
JER.23.15	Therefore thus says the 
JER.23.15	“Behold, I will feed them with wormwood,
JER.23.15	and give them poisoned water to drink;
JER.23.15	for from the prophets of Jerusalem
JER.23.15	ungodliness has gone forth into all the land.”
JER.23.16	Thus says the 
JER.23.17	They say continually to those who despise the word of the 
JER.23.18	For who among them has stood in the council of the 
JER.23.18	to perceive and to hear his word,
JER.23.18	or who has given heed to his word and listened?
JER.23.19	Behold, the storm of the 
JER.23.19	Wrath has gone forth,
JER.23.19	a whirling tempest;
JER.23.19	it will burst upon the head of the wicked.
JER.23.20	The anger of the 
JER.23.20	until he has executed and accomplished
JER.23.20	the intents of his mind.
JER.23.20	In the latter days you will understand it clearly.
JER.23.21	“I did not send the prophets,
JER.23.21	yet they ran;
JER.23.21	I did not speak to them,
JER.23.21	yet they prophesied.
JER.23.22	But if they had stood in my council,
JER.23.22	then they would have proclaimed my words to my people,
JER.23.22	and they would have turned them from their evil way,
JER.23.22	and from the evil of their doings.
JER.23.23	“Am I a God at hand, says the 
JER.23.24	Can a man hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him? says the 
JER.23.25	I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in my name, saying, ‘I have dreamed, I have dreamed!’ 
JER.23.26	How long shall there be lies
JER.23.27	who think to make my people forget my name by their dreams which they tell one another, even as their fathers forgot my name for Baal? 
JER.23.28	Let the prophet who has a dream tell the dream, but let him who has my word speak my word faithfully. What has straw in common with wheat? says the 
JER.23.29	Is not my word like fire, says the 
JER.23.30	Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, says the 
JER.23.31	Behold, I am against the prophets, says the 
JER.23.32	Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams, says the 
JER.23.33	“When one of this people, or a prophet, or a priest asks you, ‘What is the burden of the 
JER.23.34	And as for the prophet, priest, or one of the people who says, ‘The burden of the 
JER.23.35	Thus shall you say, every one to his neighbor and every one to his brother, ‘What has the 
JER.23.36	But ‘the burden of the 
JER.23.37	Thus you shall say to the prophet, ‘What has the 
JER.23.38	But if you say, ‘The burden of the 
JER.23.39	therefore, behold, I will surely lift you up and cast you away from my presence, you and the city which I gave to you and your fathers. 
JER.23.40	And I will bring upon you everlasting reproach and perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.’ ”
JER.24.1	After Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had taken into exile from Jerusalem Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, together with the princes of Judah, the craftsmen, and the smiths, and had brought them to Babylon, the 
JER.24.2	One basket had very good figs, like first-ripe figs, but the other basket had very bad figs, so bad that they could not be eaten. 
JER.24.3	And the 
JER.24.4	Then the word of the 
JER.24.5	“Thus says the 
JER.24.6	I will set my eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them back to this land. I will build them up, and not tear them down; I will plant them, and not uproot them. 
JER.24.7	I will give them a heart to know that I am the 
JER.24.8	“But thus says the 
JER.24.9	I will make them a horror
JER.24.10	And I will send sword, famine, and pestilence upon them, until they shall be utterly destroyed from the land which I gave to them and their fathers.”
JER.25.1	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon), 
JER.25.2	which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: 
JER.25.3	“For twenty-three years, from the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, to this day, the word of the 
JER.25.4	You have neither listened nor inclined your ears to hear, although the 
JER.25.5	saying, ‘Turn now, every one of you, from his evil way and wrong doings, and dwell upon the land which the 
JER.25.6	do not go after other gods to serve and worship them, or provoke me to anger with the work of your hands. Then I will do you no harm.’ 
JER.25.7	Yet you have not listened to me, says the 
JER.25.8	“Therefore thus says the 
JER.25.9	behold, I will send for all the tribes of the north, says the 
JER.25.10	 Moreover, I will banish from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the grinding of the millstones and the light of the lamp. 
JER.25.11	This whole land shall become a ruin and a waste, and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years. 
JER.25.12	Then after seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans, for their iniquity, says the 
JER.25.13	I will bring upon that land all the words which I have uttered against it, everything written in this book, which Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations. 
JER.25.14	For many nations and great kings shall make slaves even of them; and I will recompense them according to their deeds and the work of their hands.”
JER.25.16	They shall drink and stagger and be crazed because of the sword which I am sending among them.”
JER.25.17	So I took the cup from the 
JER.25.18	Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, its kings and princes, to make them a desolation and a waste, a hissing and a curse, as at this day; 
JER.25.19	Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his princes, all his people, 
JER.25.20	and all the foreign folk among them; all the kings of the land of Uz and all the kings of the land of the Philistines (Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod); 
JER.25.21	Edom, Moab, and the sons of Ammon; 
JER.25.22	all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the coastland across the sea; 
JER.25.23	Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who cut the corners of their hair; 
JER.25.24	all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the mixed tribes that dwell in the desert; 
JER.25.25	all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media; 
JER.25.26	all the kings of the north, far and near, one after another, and all the kingdoms of the world which are on the face of the earth. And after them the king of Babylon
JER.25.27	“Then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the 
JER.25.28	“And if they refuse to accept the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the 
JER.25.29	For behold, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name, and shall you go unpunished? You shall not go unpunished, for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth, says the 
JER.25.30	“You, therefore, shall prophesy against them all these words, and say to them:
JER.25.30	‘The 
JER.25.30	and from his holy habitation utter his voice;
JER.25.30	he will roar mightily against his fold,
JER.25.30	and shout, like those who tread grapes,
JER.25.30	against all the inhabitants of the earth.
JER.25.31	The clamor will resound to the ends of the earth,
JER.25.31	for the 
JER.25.31	he is entering into judgment with all flesh,
JER.25.31	and the wicked he will put to the sword,
JER.25.31	says the 
JER.25.32	“Thus says the 
JER.25.32	Behold, evil is going forth
JER.25.32	from nation to nation,
JER.25.32	and a great tempest is stirring
JER.25.32	from the farthest parts of the earth!
JER.25.33	“And those slain by the 
JER.25.34	“Wail, you shepherds, and cry,
JER.25.34	and roll in ashes, you lords of the flock,
JER.25.34	for the days of your slaughter and dispersion have come,
JER.25.34	and you shall fall like choice rams.
JER.25.35	No refuge will remain for the shepherds,
JER.25.35	nor escape for the lords of the flock.
JER.25.36	Hark, the cry of the shepherds,
JER.25.36	and the wail of the lords of the flock!
JER.25.36	For the 
JER.25.37	and the peaceful folds are devastated,
JER.25.37	because of the fierce anger of the 
JER.25.38	Like a lion he has left his covert,
JER.25.38	for their land has become a waste
JER.25.38	because of the sword of the oppressor,
JER.25.38	and because of his fierce anger.”
JER.26.1	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from the 
JER.26.2	“Thus says the 
JER.26.3	It may be they will listen, and every one turn from his evil way, that I may repent of the evil which I intend to do to them because of their evil doings. 
JER.26.4	You shall say to them, ‘Thus says the 
JER.26.5	and to heed the words of my servants the prophets whom I send to you urgently, though you have not heeded, 
JER.26.6	then I will make this house like Shiloh, and I will make this city a curse for all the nations of the earth.’ ”
JER.26.7	The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the 
JER.26.8	And when Jeremiah had finished speaking all that the 
JER.26.9	Why have you prophesied in the name of the 
JER.26.10	When the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king's house to the house of the 
JER.26.11	Then the priests and the prophets said to the princes and to all the people, “This man deserves the sentence of death, because he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own ears.”
JER.26.12	Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and all the people, saying, “The 
JER.26.13	Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the 
JER.26.14	But as for me, behold, I am in your hands. Do with me as seems good and right to you. 
JER.26.15	Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and its inhabitants, for in truth the 
JER.26.16	Then the princes and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, “This man does not deserve the sentence of death, for he has spoken to us in the name of the 
JER.26.17	And certain of the elders of the land arose and spoke to all the assembled people, saying, 
JER.26.18	“Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and said to all the people of Judah: ‘Thus says the 
JER.26.18	Zion shall be plowed as a field;
JER.26.18	Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins,
JER.26.18	and the mountain of the house a wooded height.’
JER.26.19	Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Did he not fear the 
JER.26.20	There was another man who prophesied in the name of the 
JER.26.21	And when King Jehoiakim, with all his warriors and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uriah heard of it, he was afraid and fled and escaped to Egypt. 
JER.26.22	Then King Jehoiakim sent to Egypt certain men, Elnathan the son of Achbor and others with him, 
JER.26.23	and they fetched Uriah from Egypt and brought him to King Jehoiakim, who slew him with the sword and cast his dead body into the burial place of the common people.
JER.26.24	But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah so that he was not given over to the people to be put to death.
JER.27.1	In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah
JER.27.2	Thus the 
JER.27.3	Send word
JER.27.4	Give them this charge for their masters: ‘Thus says the 
JER.27.5	“It is I who by my great power and my outstretched arm have made the earth, with the men and animals that are on the earth, and I give it to whomever it seems right to me. 
JER.27.6	Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant, and I have given him also the beasts of the field to serve him. 
JER.27.7	All the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson, until the time of his own land comes; then many nations and great kings shall make him their slave.
JER.27.8	“ ‘ “But if any nation or kingdom will not serve this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, says the 
JER.27.9	So do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers,
JER.27.10	For it is a lie which they are prophesying to you, with the result that you will be removed far from your land, and I will drive you out, and you will perish. 
JER.27.11	But any nation which will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will leave on its own land, to till it and dwell there, says the 
JER.27.12	To Zedekiah king of Judah I spoke in like manner: “Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live. 
JER.27.13	Why will you and your people die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, as the 
JER.27.14	Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are saying to you, ‘You shall not serve the king of Babylon,’ for it is a lie which they are prophesying to you. 
JER.27.15	I have not sent them, says the 
JER.27.16	Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, “Thus says the 
JER.27.17	Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon and live. Why should this city become a desolation? 
JER.27.18	If they are prophets, and if the word of the 
JER.27.19	For thus says the 
JER.27.20	which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take away, when he took into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem— 
JER.27.21	thus says the 
JER.27.22	They shall be carried to Babylon and remain there until the day when I give attention to them, says the 
JER.28.1	In that same year, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fifth month of the fourth year, Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet from Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the 
JER.28.2	“Thus says the 
JER.28.3	Within two years I will bring back to this place all the vessels of the 
JER.28.4	I will also bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the exiles from Judah who went to Babylon, says the 
JER.28.5	Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to Hananiah the prophet in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the 
JER.28.6	and the prophet Jeremiah said, “Amen! May the 
JER.28.7	Yet hear now this word which I speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people. 
JER.28.8	The prophets who preceded you and me from ancient times prophesied war, famine, and pestilence against many countries and great kingdoms. 
JER.28.9	As for the prophet who prophesies peace, when the word of that prophet comes to pass, then it will be known that the 
JER.28.10	Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke-bars from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, and broke them. 
JER.28.11	And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, “Thus says the 
JER.28.12	Sometime after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke-bars from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, the word of the 
JER.28.13	“Go, tell Hananiah, ‘Thus says the 
JER.28.14	For thus says the 
JER.28.15	And Jeremiah the prophet said to the prophet Hananiah, “Listen, Hananiah, the 
JER.28.16	Therefore thus says the 
JER.28.17	In that same year, in the seventh month, the prophet Hananiah died.
JER.29.1	These are the words of the letter which Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the elders
JER.29.2	This was after King Jeconiah, and the queen mother, the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem. 
JER.29.3	The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. It said: 
JER.29.4	“Thus says the 
JER.29.5	Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat their produce. 
JER.29.6	Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your sons, and give your daughters in marriage, that they may bear sons and daughters; multiply there, and do not decrease. 
JER.29.7	But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the 
JER.29.8	For thus says the 
JER.29.9	for it is a lie which they are prophesying to you in my name; I did not send them, says the 
JER.29.10	“For thus says the 
JER.29.11	For I know the plans I have for you, says the 
JER.29.12	Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will hear you. 
JER.29.13	You will seek me and find me; when you seek me with all your heart, 
JER.29.14	I will be found by you, says the 
JER.29.15	“Because you have said, ‘The

JER.29.17	‘Thus says the 
JER.29.18	I will pursue them with sword, famine, and pestilence, and will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, a terror, a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them, 
JER.29.19	because they did not heed my words, says the 
JER.29.20	Hear the word of the 
JER.29.21	‘Thus says the 
JER.29.22	Because of them this curse shall be used by all the exiles from Judah in Babylon: “The 
JER.29.23	because they have committed folly in Israel, they have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and they have spoken in my name lying words which I did not command them. I am the one who knows, and I am witness, says the 
JER.29.24	To Shemaiah of Nehelam you shall say: 
JER.29.25	“Thus says the 
JER.29.26	‘The 
JER.29.27	Now why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who is prophesying to you? 
JER.29.28	For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, “Your exile will be long; build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their produce.” ’ ”
JER.29.29	Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet. 
JER.29.30	Then the word of the 
JER.29.31	“Send to all the exiles, saying, ‘Thus says the 
JER.29.32	therefore thus says the 
JER.30.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.30.2	“Thus says the 
JER.30.3	For behold, days are coming, says the 
JER.30.4	These are the words which the 
JER.30.5	“Thus says the 
JER.30.5	We have heard a cry of panic,
JER.30.5	of terror, and no peace.
JER.30.6	Ask now, and see,
JER.30.6	can a man bear a child?
JER.30.6	Why then do I see every man
JER.30.6	with his hands on his loins like a woman in labor?
JER.30.6	Why has every face turned pale?
JER.30.7	Alas! that day is so great
JER.30.7	there is none like it;
JER.30.7	it is a time of distress for Jacob;
JER.30.7	yet he shall be saved out of it.
JER.30.8	“And it shall come to pass in that day, says the 
JER.30.9	But they shall serve the

JER.30.10	nor be dismayed, O Israel;
JER.30.10	for lo, I will save you from afar,
JER.30.10	and your offspring from the land of their captivity.
JER.30.10	Jacob shall return and have quiet and ease,
JER.30.10	and none shall make him afraid.
JER.30.11	For I am with you to save you,
JER.30.11	says the 
JER.30.11	I will make a full end of all the nations
JER.30.11	among whom I scattered you,
JER.30.11	but of you I will not make a full end.
JER.30.11	I will chasten you in just measure,
JER.30.11	and I will by no means leave you unpunished.
JER.30.12	“For thus says the 
JER.30.12	Your hurt is incurable,
JER.30.12	and your wound is grievous.
JER.30.13	There is none to uphold your cause,
JER.30.13	no medicine for your wound,
JER.30.13	no healing for you.
JER.30.14	All your lovers have forgotten you;
JER.30.14	they care nothing for you;
JER.30.14	for I have dealt you the blow of an enemy,
JER.30.14	the punishment of a merciless foe,
JER.30.14	because your guilt is great,
JER.30.14	because your sins are flagrant.
JER.30.15	Why do you cry out over your hurt?
JER.30.15	Your pain is incurable.
JER.30.15	Because your guilt is great,
JER.30.15	because your sins are flagrant,
JER.30.15	I have done these things to you.
JER.30.16	Therefore all who devour you shall be devoured,
JER.30.16	and all your foes, every one of them, shall go into captivity;
JER.30.16	those who despoil you shall become a spoil,
JER.30.16	and all who prey on you I will make a prey.
JER.30.17	For I will restore health to you,
JER.30.17	and your wounds I will heal,
JER.30.17	says the 
JER.30.17	because they have called you an outcast:

JER.30.18	and the palace shall stand where it used to be.
JER.30.19	Out of them shall come songs of thanksgiving,
JER.30.19	and the voices of those who make merry.
JER.30.19	I will multiply them, and they shall not be few;
JER.30.19	I will make them honored, and they shall not be small.
JER.30.20	Their children shall be as they were of old,
JER.30.20	and their congregation shall be established before me;

JER.30.21	says the 
JER.30.22	And you shall be my people,
JER.30.22	and I will be your God.”
JER.30.23	Behold the storm of the 
JER.30.23	Wrath has gone forth,
JER.30.23	a whirling tempest;
JER.30.23	it will burst upon the head of the wicked.
JER.30.24	The fierce anger of the 
JER.30.24	until he has executed and accomplished
JER.30.24	the intents of his mind.
JER.30.24	In the latter days you will understand this.
JER.31.1	“At that time, says the 
JER.31.2	Thus says the 
JER.31.2	“The people who survived the sword
JER.31.2	found grace in the wilderness;
JER.31.2	when Israel sought for rest,
JER.31.3	the 
JER.31.3	I have loved you with an everlasting love;
JER.31.3	therefore I have continued my faithfulness to you.
JER.31.4	Again I will build you, and you shall be built,
JER.31.4	O virgin Israel!
JER.31.4	Again you shall adorn yourself with timbrels,
JER.31.4	and shall go forth in the dance of the merrymakers.
JER.31.5	Again you shall plant vineyards
JER.31.5	upon the mountains of Samaria;
JER.31.5	the planters shall plant,
JER.31.5	and shall enjoy the fruit.
JER.31.6	For there shall be a day when watchmen will call
JER.31.6	in the hill country of Ephraim:
JER.31.6	‘Arise, and let us go up to Zion,
JER.31.6	to the 
JER.31.7	For thus says the 
JER.31.7	“Sing aloud with gladness for Jacob,
JER.31.7	and raise shouts for the chief of the nations;
JER.31.7	proclaim, give praise, and say,
JER.31.7	‘The 
JER.31.7	the remnant of Israel.’
JER.31.8	Behold, I will bring them from the north country,
JER.31.8	and gather them from the farthest parts of the earth,
JER.31.8	among them the blind and the lame,
JER.31.8	the woman with child and her who is in travail, together;
JER.31.8	a great company, they shall return here.
JER.31.9	With weeping they shall come,
JER.31.9	and with consolations
JER.31.9	I will make them walk by brooks of water,
JER.31.9	in a straight path in which they shall not stumble;
JER.31.9	for I am a father to Israel,
JER.31.9	and Ephraim is my first-born.
JER.31.10	“Hear the word of the 
JER.31.10	and declare it in the coastlands afar off;
JER.31.10	say, ‘He who scattered Israel will gather him,
JER.31.10	and will keep him as a shepherd keeps his flock.’
JER.31.11	For the 
JER.31.11	and has redeemed him from hands too strong for him.
JER.31.12	They shall come and sing aloud on the height of Zion,
JER.31.12	and they shall be radiant over the goodness of the 
JER.31.12	over the grain, the wine, and the oil,
JER.31.12	and over the young of the flock and the herd;
JER.31.12	their life shall be like a watered garden,
JER.31.12	and they shall languish no more.
JER.31.13	Then shall the maidens rejoice in the dance,
JER.31.13	and the young men and the old shall be merry.
JER.31.13	I will turn their mourning into joy,
JER.31.13	I will comfort them, and give them gladness for sorrow.
JER.31.14	I will feast the soul of the priests with abundance,
JER.31.14	and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness,
JER.31.14	says the 
JER.31.15	“A voice is heard in Ramah,
JER.31.15	lamentation and bitter weeping.
JER.31.15	Rachel is weeping for her children;
JER.31.15	she refuses to be comforted for her children,
JER.31.15	because they are not.”
JER.31.16	Thus says the 
JER.31.16	“Keep your voice from weeping,
JER.31.16	and your eyes from tears;
JER.31.16	for your work shall be rewarded,
JER.31.16	says the 
JER.31.16	and they shall come back from the land of the enemy.
JER.31.17	There is hope for your future,
JER.31.17	says the 
JER.31.17	and your children shall come back to their own country.
JER.31.18	I have heard Ephraim bemoaning,
JER.31.18	‘Thou hast chastened me, and I was chastened,
JER.31.18	like an untrained calf;
JER.31.18	bring me back that I may be restored,
JER.31.18	for thou art the 
JER.31.19	For after I had turned away I repented;
JER.31.19	and after I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh;
JER.31.19	I was ashamed, and I was confounded,
JER.31.19	because I bore the disgrace of my youth.’
JER.31.20	Is Ephraim my dear son?
JER.31.20	Is he my darling child?
JER.31.20	For as often as I speak against him,
JER.31.20	I do remember him still.
JER.31.20	Therefore my heart yearns for him;
JER.31.20	I will surely have mercy on him,
JER.31.20	says the 
JER.31.21	“Set up waymarks for yourself,
JER.31.21	make yourself guideposts;
JER.31.21	consider well the highway,
JER.31.21	the road by which you went.
JER.31.21	Return, O virgin Israel,
JER.31.21	return to these your cities.
JER.31.22	How long will you waver,
JER.31.22	O faithless daughter?
JER.31.22	For the 
JER.31.22	a woman protects a man.”
JER.31.23	Thus says the 
JER.31.23	‘The 
JER.31.23	O holy hill!’
JER.31.24	And Judah and all its cities shall dwell there together, and the farmers and those who wander
JER.31.25	For I will satisfy the weary soul, and every languishing soul I will replenish.”
JER.31.26	Thereupon I awoke and looked, and my sleep was pleasant to me.
JER.31.27	“Behold, the days are coming, says the 
JER.31.28	And it shall come to pass that as I have watched over them to pluck up and break down, to overthrow, destroy, and bring evil, so I will watch over them to build and to plant, says the 
JER.31.29	In those days they shall no longer say:
JER.31.29	‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes,
JER.31.29	and the children's teeth are set on edge.’
JER.31.30	But every one shall die for his own sin; each man who eats sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.
JER.31.32	not like the covenant which I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant which they broke, though I was their husband, says the 
JER.31.33	But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the 
JER.31.34	And no longer shall each man teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, ‘Know the 
JER.31.35	Thus says the 
JER.31.35	who gives the sun for light by day
JER.31.35	and the fixed order of the moon and the stars for light by night,

JER.31.35	the 
JER.31.36	“If this fixed order departs
JER.31.36	from before me, says the 
JER.31.36	then shall the descendants of Israel cease
JER.31.36	from being a nation before me for ever.”
JER.31.37	Thus says the 
JER.31.37	“If the heavens above can be measured,
JER.31.37	and the foundations of the earth below can be explored,
JER.31.37	then I will cast off all the descendants of Israel
JER.31.37	for all that they have done,
JER.31.37	says the 
JER.31.38	“Behold, the days are coming says the 
JER.31.39	And the measuring line shall go out farther, straight to the hill Gareb, and shall then turn to Goah. 
JER.31.40	The whole valley of the dead bodies and the ashes, and all the fields as far as the brook Kidron, to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east, shall be sacred to the 
JER.32.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.32.2	At that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard which was in the palace of the king of Judah. 
JER.32.3	For Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him, saying, “Why do you prophesy and say, ‘Thus says the 
JER.32.4	Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye; 
JER.32.5	and he shall take Zedekiah to Babylon, and there he shall remain until I visit him, says the 
JER.32.6	Jeremiah said, “The word of the 
JER.32.7	Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you and say, ‘Buy my field which is at Anathoth, for the right of redemption by purchase is yours.’ 
JER.32.8	Then Hanamel my cousin came to me in the court of the guard, in accordance with the word of the 
JER.32.9	“And I bought the field at Anathoth from Hanamel my cousin, and weighed out the money to him, seventeen shekels of silver. 
JER.32.10	I signed the deed, sealed it, got witnesses, and weighed the money on scales. 
JER.32.11	Then I took the sealed deed of purchase, containing the terms and conditions, and the open copy; 
JER.32.12	and I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my cousin, in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, and in the presence of all the Jews who were sitting in the court of the guard. 
JER.32.13	I charged Baruch in their presence, saying, 
JER.32.14	‘Thus says the 
JER.32.15	For thus says the 
JER.32.16	“After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to the

JER.32.19	great in counsel and mighty in deed; whose eyes are open to all the ways of men, rewarding every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings; 
JER.32.20	who hast shown signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and to this day in Israel and among all mankind, and hast made thee a name, as at this day. 
JER.32.21	Thou didst bring thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and outstretched arm, and with great terror; 
JER.32.22	and thou gavest them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey; 
JER.32.23	and they entered and took possession of it. But they did not obey thy voice or walk in thy law; they did nothing of all thou didst command them to do. Therefore thou hast made all this evil come upon them. 
JER.32.24	Behold, the siege mounds have come up to the city to take it, and because of sword and famine and pestilence the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it. What thou didst speak has come to pass, and behold, thou seest it. 
JER.32.25	Yet thou, O Lord 
JER.32.26	The word of the 
JER.32.27	“Behold, I am the 
JER.32.28	Therefore, thus says the 
JER.32.29	The Chaldeans who are fighting against this city shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses on whose roofs incense has been offered to Baal and drink offerings have been poured out to other gods, to provoke me to anger. 
JER.32.30	For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have done nothing but evil in my sight from their youth; the sons of Israel have done nothing but provoke me to anger by the work of their hands, says the 
JER.32.31	This city has aroused my anger and wrath, from the day it was built to this day, so that I will remove it from my sight 
JER.32.32	because of all the evil of the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah which they did to provoke me to anger—their kings and their princes, their priests and their prophets, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
JER.32.33	They have turned to me their back and not their face; and though I have taught them persistently they have not listened to receive instruction. 
JER.32.34	They set up their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it. 
JER.32.35	They built the high places of Baal in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to offer up their sons and daughters to Molech, though I did not command them, nor did it enter into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
JER.32.36	“Now therefore thus says the 
JER.32.37	Behold, I will gather them from all the countries to which I drove them in my anger and my wrath and in great indignation; I will bring them back to this place, and I will make them dwell in safety. 
JER.32.38	 And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. 
JER.32.39	I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for their own good and the good of their children after them. 
JER.32.40	I will make with them an everlasting covenant, that I will not turn away from doing good to them; and I will put the fear of me in their hearts, that they may not turn from me. 
JER.32.41	I will rejoice in doing them good, and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness, with all my heart and all my soul.
JER.32.42	“For thus says the 
JER.32.43	Fields shall be bought in this land of which you are saying, It is a desolation, without man or beast; it is given into the hands of the Chaldeans. 
JER.32.44	Fields shall be bought for money, and deeds shall be signed and sealed and witnessed, in the land of Benjamin, in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the Shephelah, and in the cities of the Negeb; for I will restore their fortunes, says the 
JER.33.1	The word of the 
JER.33.2	“Thus says the 
JER.33.3	Call to me and I will answer you, and will tell you great and hidden things which you have not known. 
JER.33.4	For thus says the 
JER.33.5	The Chaldeans are coming in to fight
JER.33.6	Behold, I will bring to it health and healing, and I will heal them and reveal to them abundance
JER.33.7	I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel, and rebuild them as they were at first. 
JER.33.8	I will cleanse them from all the guilt of their sin against me, and I will forgive all the guilt of their sin and rebellion against me. 
JER.33.9	And this city
JER.33.10	“Thus says the 
JER.33.11	the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voices of those who sing, as they bring thank offerings to the house of the 
JER.33.11	‘Give thanks to the 
JER.33.11	for the 
JER.33.11	for his steadfast love endures for ever!’
JER.33.11	For I will restore the fortunes of the land as at first, says the 
JER.33.12	“Thus says the 
JER.33.13	In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the Shephelah, and in the cities of the Negeb, in the land of Benjamin, the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, flocks shall again pass under the hands of the one who counts them, says the 
JER.33.14	“Behold, the days are coming, says the 
JER.33.15	 In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch to spring forth for David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. 
JER.33.16	In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will dwell securely. And this is the name by which it will be called: ‘The 
JER.33.17	“For thus says the 
JER.33.18	and the Levitical priests shall never lack a man in my presence to offer burnt offerings, to burn cereal offerings, and to make sacrifices for ever.”
JER.33.19	The word of the 
JER.33.20	“Thus says the 
JER.33.21	then also my covenant with David my servant may be broken, so that he shall not have a son to reign on his throne, and my covenant with the Levitical priests my ministers. 
JER.33.22	As the host of heaven cannot be numbered and the sands of the sea cannot be measured, so I will multiply the descendants of David my servant, and the Levitical priests who minister to me.”
JER.33.23	The word of the 
JER.33.24	“Have you not observed what these people are saying, ‘The 
JER.33.25	Thus says the 
JER.33.26	then I will reject the descendants of Jacob and David my servant and will not choose one of his descendants to rule over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will restore their fortunes, and will have mercy upon them.”
JER.34.1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.34.2	“Thus says the 
JER.34.3	You shall not escape from his hand, but shall surely be captured and delivered into his hand; you shall see the king of Babylon eye to eye and speak with him face to face; and you shall go to Babylon.’ 
JER.34.4	Yet hear the word of the 
JER.34.5	You shall die in peace. And as spices were burned for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so men shall burn spices for you and lament for you, saying, “Alas, lord!” ’ For I have spoken the word, says the 
JER.34.6	Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem, 
JER.34.7	when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left, Lachish and Azekah; for these were the only fortified cities of Judah that remained.
JER.34.8	The word which came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.34.9	that every one should set free his Hebrew slaves, male and female, so that no one should enslave a Jew, his brother. 
JER.34.10	And they obeyed, all the princes and all the people who had entered into the covenant that every one would set free his slave, male or female, so that they would not be enslaved again; they obeyed and set them free. 
JER.34.11	But afterward they turned around and took back the male and female slaves they had set free, and brought them into subjection as slaves. 
JER.34.12	The word of the 
JER.34.13	“Thus says the 
JER.34.14	‘At the end of six
JER.34.15	You recently repented and did what was right in my eyes by proclaiming liberty, each to his neighbor, and you made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name; 
JER.34.16	but then you turned around and profaned my name when each of you took back his male and female slaves, whom you had set free according to their desire, and you brought them into subjection to be your slaves. 
JER.34.17	Therefore, thus says the 
JER.34.18	And the men who transgressed my covenant and did not keep the terms of the covenant which they made before me, I will make like
JER.34.19	the princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf; 
JER.34.20	and I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives. Their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth. 
JER.34.21	And Zedekiah king of Judah, and his princes I will give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives, into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon which has withdrawn from you. 
JER.34.22	Behold, I will command, says the 
JER.35.1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.35.2	“Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak with them, and bring them to the house of the 
JER.35.3	So I took Ja-azaniah the son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, and his brothers, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites. 
JER.35.4	I brought them to the house of the 
JER.35.5	Then I set before the Rechabites pitchers full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, “Drink wine.” 
JER.35.6	But they answered, “We will drink no wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, ‘You shall not drink wine, neither you nor your sons for ever; 
JER.35.7	you shall not build a house; you shall not sow seed; you shall not plant or have a vineyard; but you shall live in tents all your days, that you may live many days in the land where you sojourn.’ 
JER.35.8	We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, ourselves, our wives, our sons, or our daughters, 
JER.35.9	and not to build houses to dwell in. We have no vineyard or field or seed; 
JER.35.10	but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed and done all that Jonadab our father commanded us. 
JER.35.11	But when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up against the land, we said, ‘Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and the army of the Syrians.’ So we are living in Jerusalem.”
JER.35.12	Then the word of the 
JER.35.13	“Thus says the 
JER.35.14	The command which Jonadab the son of Rechab gave to his sons, to drink no wine, has been kept; and they drink none to this day, for they have obeyed their father's command. I have spoken to you persistently, but you have not listened to me. 
JER.35.15	I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, sending them persistently, saying, ‘Turn now every one of you from his evil way, and amend your doings, and do not go after other gods to serve them, and then you shall dwell in the land which I gave to you and your fathers.’ But you did not incline your ear or listen to me. 
JER.35.16	The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have kept the command which their father gave them, but this people has not obeyed me. 
JER.35.17	Therefore, thus says the 
JER.35.18	But to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said, “Thus says the 
JER.35.19	therefore thus says the 
JER.36.1	In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.36.2	“Take a scroll and write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel and Judah and all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah until today. 
JER.36.3	It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I intend to do to them, so that every one may turn from his evil way, and that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.”
JER.36.4	Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote upon a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the 
JER.36.5	And Jeremiah ordered Baruch, saying, “I am debarred from going to the house of the 
JER.36.6	so you are to go, and on a fast day in the hearing of all the people in the 
JER.36.7	It may be that their supplication will come before the 
JER.36.8	And Baruch the son of Neriah did all that Jeremiah the prophet ordered him about reading from the scroll the words of the 
JER.36.9	In the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the 
JER.36.10	Then, in the hearing of all the people, Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the scroll, in the house of the 
JER.36.11	When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the 
JER.36.12	he went down to the king's house, into the secretary's chamber; and all the princes were sitting there: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes. 
JER.36.13	And Micaiah told them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the scroll in the hearing of the people. 
JER.36.14	Then all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, son of Shelemiah, son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, “Take in your hand the scroll that you read in the hearing of the people, and come.” So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them. 
JER.36.15	And they said to him, “Sit down and read it.” So Baruch read it to them. 
JER.36.16	When they heard all the words, they turned one to another in fear; and they said to Baruch, “We must report all these words to the king.” 
JER.36.17	Then they asked Baruch, “Tell us, how did you write all these words? Was it at his dictation?” 
JER.36.18	Baruch answered them, “He dictated all these words to me, while I wrote them with ink on the scroll.” 
JER.36.19	Then the princes said to Baruch, “Go and hide, you and Jeremiah, and let no one know where you are.”
JER.36.20	So they went into the court to the king, having put the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the secretary; and they reported all the words to the king. 
JER.36.21	Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the secretary; and Jehudi read it to the king and all the princes who stood beside the king. 
JER.36.22	It was the ninth month, and the king was sitting in the winter house and there was a fire burning in the brazier before him. 
JER.36.23	As Jehudi read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a penknife and throw them into the fire in the brazier, until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier. 
JER.36.24	Yet neither the king, nor any of his servants who heard all these words, was afraid, nor did they rend their garments. 
JER.36.25	Even when Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them. 
JER.36.26	And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son and Seraiah the son of Azri-el and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet, but the 
JER.36.27	Now, after the king had burned the scroll with the words which Baruch wrote at Jeremiah's dictation, the word of the 
JER.36.28	“Take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned. 
JER.36.29	And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, ‘Thus says the 
JER.36.30	Therefore thus says the 
JER.36.31	And I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity; I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they would not hear.’ ”
JER.36.32	Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and many similar words were added to them.
JER.37.1	Zedekiah the son of Josiah, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah, reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim. 
JER.37.2	But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the words of the 
JER.37.3	King Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the priest, the son of Ma-aseiah, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “Pray for us to the 
JER.37.4	Now Jeremiah was still going in and out among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison. 
JER.37.5	The army of Pharaoh had come out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.
JER.37.6	Then the word of the 
JER.37.7	“Thus says the 
JER.37.8	And the Chaldeans shall come back and fight against this city; they shall take it and burn it with fire. 
JER.37.9	Thus says the 
JER.37.10	For even if you should defeat the whole army of Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and there remained of them only wounded men, every man in his tent, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.’ ”
JER.37.11	Now when the Chaldean army had withdrawn from Jerusalem at the approach of Pharaoh's army, 
JER.37.12	Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to receive his portion
JER.37.13	When he was at the Benjamin Gate, a sentry there named Irijah the son of Shelemiah, son of Hananiah, seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are deserting to the Chaldeans.” 
JER.37.14	And Jeremiah said, “It is false; I am not deserting to the Chaldeans.” But Irijah would not listen to him, and seized Jeremiah and brought him to the princes. 
JER.37.15	And the princes were enraged at Jeremiah, and they beat him and imprisoned him in the house of Jonathan the secretary, for it had been made a prison.
JER.37.16	When Jeremiah had come to the dungeon cells, and remained there many days, 
JER.37.17	King Zedekiah sent for him, and received him. The king questioned him secretly in his house, and said, “Is there any word from the 
JER.37.18	Jeremiah also said to King Zedekiah, “What wrong have I done to you or your servants or this people, that you have put me in prison? 
JER.37.19	Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land’? 
JER.37.20	Now hear, I pray you, O my lord the king: let my humble plea come before you, and do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, lest I die there.” 
JER.37.21	So King Zedekiah gave orders, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guard; and a loaf of bread was given him daily from the bakers' street, until all the bread of the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
JER.38.1	Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah was saying to all the people, 
JER.38.2	“Thus says the 
JER.38.3	Thus says the 
JER.38.4	Then the princes said to the king, “Let this man be put to death, for he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm.” 
JER.38.5	King Zedekiah said, “Behold, he is in your hands; for the king can do nothing against you.” 
JER.38.6	So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king's son, which was in the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down by ropes. And there was no water in the cistern, but only mire, and Jeremiah sank in the mire.
JER.38.7	When Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern—the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate— 
JER.38.8	Ebed-melech went from the king's house and said to the king, 
JER.38.9	“My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they did to Jeremiah the prophet by casting him into the cistern; and he will die there of hunger, for there is no bread left in the city.” 
JER.38.10	Then the king commanded Ebed-melech, the Ethiopian, “Take three men with you from here, and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.” 
JER.38.11	So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to the house of the king, to a wardrobe of
JER.38.12	Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Put the rags and clothes between your armpits and the ropes.” Jeremiah did so. 
JER.38.13	Then they drew Jeremiah up with ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
JER.38.14	King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and received him at the third entrance of the temple of the 
JER.38.15	Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I tell you, will you not be sure to put me to death? And if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.” 
JER.38.16	Then King Zedekiah swore secretly to Jeremiah, “As the 
JER.38.17	Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Thus says the 
JER.38.18	But if you do not surrender to the princes of the king of Babylon, then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape from their hand.” 
JER.38.19	King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest I be handed over to them and they abuse me.” 
JER.38.20	Jeremiah said, “You shall not be given to them. Obey now the voice of the 
JER.38.21	But if you refuse to surrender, this is the vision which the 
JER.38.22	Behold, all the women left in the house of the king of Judah were being led out to the princes of the king of Babylon and were saying,
JER.38.22	‘Your trusted friends have deceived you
JER.38.22	and prevailed against you;
JER.38.22	now that your feet are sunk in the mire,
JER.38.22	they turn away from you.’
JER.38.23	All your wives and your sons shall be led out to the Chaldeans, and you yourself shall not escape from their hand, but shall be seized by the king of Babylon; and this city shall be burned with fire.”
JER.38.24	Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no one know of these words and you shall not die. 
JER.38.25	If the princes hear that I have spoken with you and come to you and say to you, ‘Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; hide nothing from us and we will not put you to death,’ 
JER.38.26	then you shall say to them, ‘I made a humble plea to the king that he would not send me back to the house of Jonathan to die there.’ ” 
JER.38.27	Then all the princes came to Jeremiah and asked him, and he answered them as the king had instructed him. So they left off speaking with him, for the conversation had not been overheard. 
JER.38.28	And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.
JER.39.1	In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and besieged it; 
JER.39.2	in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city. 
JER.39.3	When Jerusalem was taken,
JER.39.4	When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled, going out of the city at night by way of the king's garden through the gate between the two walls; and they went toward the Arabah. 
JER.39.5	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, at Riblah, in the land of Hamath; and he passed sentence upon him. 
JER.39.6	The king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah before his eyes; and the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah. 
JER.39.7	He put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters to take him to Babylon. 
JER.39.8	The Chaldeans burned the king's house and the house of the people, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. 
JER.39.9	Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried into exile to Babylon the rest of the people who were left in the city, those who had deserted to him, and the people who remained. 
JER.39.10	Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, left in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
JER.39.11	Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave command concerning Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, saying, 
JER.39.12	“Take him, look after him well and do him no harm, but deal with him as he tells you.” 
JER.39.13	So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, Nebushazban the Rabsaris, Nergal-sharezer the Rabmag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon 
JER.39.14	sent and took Jeremiah from the court of the guard. They entrusted him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, that he should take him home. So he dwelt among the people.
JER.39.15	The word of the 
JER.39.16	“Go, and say to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, ‘Thus says the 
JER.39.17	But I will deliver you on that day, says the 
JER.39.18	For I will surely save you, and you shall not fall by the sword; but you shall have your life as a prize of war, because you have put your trust in me, says the 
JER.40.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.40.2	The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, “The 
JER.40.3	the 
JER.40.4	Now, behold, I release you today from the chains on your hands. If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will look after you well; but if it seems wrong to you to come with me to Babylon, do not come. See, the whole land is before you; go wherever you think it good and right to go. 
JER.40.5	If you remain,
JER.40.6	Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah, and dwelt with him among the people who were left in the land.
JER.40.7	When all the captains of the forces in the open country and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, women, and children, those of the poorest of the land who had not been taken into exile to Babylon, 
JER.40.8	they went to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the son of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, Jezaniah the son of the Ma-acathite, they and their men. 
JER.40.9	Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, swore to them and their men, saying, “Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. 
JER.40.10	As for me, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand for you before the Chaldeans who will come to us; but as for you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and store them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.” 
JER.40.11	Likewise, when all the Jews who were in Moab and among the Ammonites and in Edom and in other lands heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, as governor over them, 
JER.40.12	then all the Jews returned from all the places to which they had been driven and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah; and they gathered wine and summer fruits in great abundance.
JER.40.13	Now Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah 
JER.40.14	and said to him, “Do you know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam would not believe them. 
JER.40.15	Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah at Mizpah, “Let me go and slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life, so that all the Jews who are gathered about you would be scattered, and the remnant of Judah would perish?” 
JER.40.16	But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “You shall not do this thing, for you are speaking falsely of Ishmael.”
JER.41.1	In the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of the royal family, one of the chief officers of the king, came with ten men to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah. As they ate bread together there at Mizpah, 
JER.41.2	Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men with him rose up and struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with the sword, and killed him, whom the king of Babylon had appointed governor in the land. 
JER.41.3	Ishmael also slew all the Jews who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldean soldiers who happened to be there.
JER.41.4	On the day after the murder of Gedaliah, before any one knew of it, 
JER.41.5	eighty men arrived from Shechem and Shiloh and Samaria, with their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and their bodies gashed, bringing cereal offerings and incense to present at the temple of the 
JER.41.6	And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah came out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he came. As he met them, he said to them, “Come in to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.” 
JER.41.7	When they came into the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men with him slew them, and cast them into a cistern. 
JER.41.8	But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, “Do not kill us, for we have stores of wheat, barley, oil, and honey hidden in the fields.” So he refrained and did not kill them with their companions.
JER.41.9	Now the cistern into which Ishmael cast all the bodies of the men whom he had slain was the large cistern
JER.41.10	Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, the king's daughters and all the people who were left at Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites.
JER.41.11	But when Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him heard of all the evil which Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done, 
JER.41.12	they took all their men and went to fight against Ishmael the son of Nethaniah. They came upon him at the great pool which is in Gibeon. 
JER.41.13	And when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him, they rejoiced. 
JER.41.14	So all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah. 
JER.41.15	But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites. 
JER.41.16	Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him took all the rest of the people whom Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had carried away captive
JER.41.17	And they went and stayed at Geruth Chimham near Bethlehem, intending to go to Egypt 
JER.41.18	because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
JER.42.1	Then all the commanders of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah and Azariah
JER.42.2	and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “Let our supplication come before you, and pray to the 
JER.42.3	that the 
JER.42.4	Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard you; behold, I will pray to the 
JER.42.5	Then they said to Jeremiah, “May the 
JER.42.6	Whether it is good or evil, we will obey the voice of the 
JER.42.7	At the end of ten days the word of the 
JER.42.8	Then he summoned Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least to the greatest, 
JER.42.9	and said to them, “Thus says the 
JER.42.10	If you will remain in this land, then I will build you up and not pull you down; I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I repent of the evil which I did to you. 
JER.42.11	Do not fear the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid; do not fear him, says the 
JER.42.12	I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy on you and let you remain in your own land. 
JER.42.13	But if you say, ‘We will not remain in this land,’ disobeying the voice of the 
JER.42.14	and saying, ‘No, we will go to the land of Egypt, where we shall not see war, or hear the sound of the trumpet, or be hungry for bread, and we will dwell there,’ 
JER.42.15	then hear the word of the 
JER.42.16	then the sword which you fear shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine of which you are afraid shall follow hard after you to Egypt; and there you shall die. 
JER.42.17	All the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to live there shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence; they shall have no remnant or survivor from the evil which I will bring upon them.
JER.42.18	“For thus says the 
JER.42.19	The 
JER.42.20	that you have gone astray at the cost of your lives. For you sent me to the 
JER.42.21	And I have this day declared it to you, but you have not obeyed the voice of the 
JER.42.22	Now therefore know for a certainty that you shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence in the place where you desire to go to live.”
JER.43.1	When Jeremiah finished speaking to all the people all these words of the 
JER.43.2	Azariah the son of Hoshaiah and Johanan the son of Kareah and all the insolent men said to Jeremiah, “You are telling a lie. The 
JER.43.3	but Baruch the son of Neriah has set you against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may kill us or take us into exile in Babylon.” 
JER.43.4	So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces and all the people did not obey the voice of the 
JER.43.5	But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took all the remnant of Judah who had returned to live in the land of Judah from all the nations to which they had been driven— 
JER.43.6	the men, the women, the children, the princesses, and every person whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan; also Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah. 
JER.43.7	And they came into the land of Egypt, for they did not obey the voice of the 
JER.43.8	Then the word of the 
JER.43.9	“Take in your hands large stones, and hide them in the mortar in the pavement which is at the entrance to Pharaoh's palace in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah, 
JER.43.10	and say to them, ‘Thus says the 
JER.43.11	He shall come and smite the land of Egypt, giving to the pestilence those who are doomed to the pestilence, to captivity those who are doomed to captivity, and to the sword those who are doomed to the sword. 
JER.43.12	He
JER.43.13	He shall break the obelisks of Heliopolis which is in the land of Egypt; and the temples of the gods of Egypt he shall burn with fire.’ ”
JER.44.1	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews that dwelt in the land of Egypt, at Migdol, at Tahpanhes, at Memphis, and in the land of Pathros, 
JER.44.2	“Thus says the 
JER.44.3	because of the wickedness which they committed, provoking me to anger, in that they went to burn incense and serve other gods that they knew not, neither they, nor you, nor your fathers. 
JER.44.4	Yet I persistently sent to you all my servants the prophets, saying, ‘Oh, do not do this abominable thing that I hate!’ 
JER.44.5	But they did not listen or incline their ear, to turn from their wickedness and burn no incense to other gods. 
JER.44.6	Therefore my wrath and my anger were poured forth and kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they became a waste and a desolation, as at this day. 
JER.44.7	And now thus says the 
JER.44.8	Why do you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have come to live, that you may be cut off and become a curse and a taunt among all the nations of the earth? 
JER.44.9	Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, the wickedness of the kings of Judah, the wickedness of their
JER.44.10	They have not humbled themselves even to this day, nor have they feared, nor walked in my law and my statutes which I set before you and before your fathers.
JER.44.11	“Therefore thus says the 
JER.44.12	I will take the remnant of Judah who have set their faces to come to the land of Egypt to live, and they shall all be consumed; in the land of Egypt they shall fall; by the sword and by famine they shall be consumed; from the least to the greatest, they shall die by the sword and by famine; and they shall become an execration, a horror, a curse, and a taunt. 
JER.44.13	I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, 
JER.44.14	so that none of the remnant of Judah who have come to live in the land of Egypt shall escape or survive or return to the land of Judah, to which they desire to return to dwell there; for they shall not return, except some fugitives.”
JER.44.15	Then all the men who knew that their wives had offered incense to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great assembly, all the people who dwelt in Pathros in the land of Egypt, answered Jeremiah: 
JER.44.16	“As for the word which you have spoken to us in the name of the 
JER.44.17	But we will do everything that we have vowed, burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out libations to her, as we did, both we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then we had plenty of food, and prospered, and saw no evil. 
JER.44.18	But since we left off burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out libations to her, we have lacked everything and have been consumed by the sword and by famine.” 
JER.44.19	And the women said,
JER.44.20	Then Jeremiah said to all the people, men and women, all the people who had given him this answer: 
JER.44.21	“As for the incense that you burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the 
JER.44.22	The 
JER.44.23	It is because you burned incense, and because you sinned against the 
JER.44.24	Jeremiah said to all the people and all the women, “Hear the word of the 
JER.44.25	Thus says the 
JER.44.26	Therefore hear the word of the 
JER.44.27	Behold, I am watching over them for evil and not for good; all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by famine, until there is an end of them. 
JER.44.28	And those who escape the sword shall return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, who came to the land of Egypt to live, shall know whose word will stand, mine or theirs. 
JER.44.29	This shall be the sign to you, says the 
JER.44.30	Thus says the 
JER.45.1	The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book at the dictation of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: 
JER.45.2	“Thus says the 
JER.45.3	You said, ‘Woe is me! for the 
JER.45.4	Thus shall you say to him, Thus says the 
JER.45.5	And do you seek great things for yourself? Seek them not; for behold, I am bringing evil upon all flesh, says the 
JER.46.2	About Egypt. Concerning the army of Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates at Carchemish and which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:
JER.46.3	“Prepare buckler and shield,
JER.46.3	and advance for battle!
JER.46.4	Harness the horses;
JER.46.4	mount, O horsemen!
JER.46.4	Take your stations with your helmets,
JER.46.4	polish your spears,
JER.46.4	put on your coats of mail!
JER.46.5	They are dismayed
JER.46.5	and have turned backward.
JER.46.5	Their warriors are beaten down,
JER.46.5	and have fled in haste;
JER.46.5	they look not back—
JER.46.5	terror on every side!
JER.46.5	says the 
JER.46.6	The swift cannot flee away,
JER.46.6	nor the warrior escape;
JER.46.6	in the north by the river Euphrates
JER.46.6	they have stumbled and fallen.
JER.46.7	“Who is this, rising like the Nile,
JER.46.7	like rivers whose waters surge?
JER.46.8	Egypt rises like the Nile,
JER.46.8	like rivers whose waters surge.
JER.46.8	He said, I will rise, I will cover the earth,
JER.46.8	I will destroy cities and their inhabitants.
JER.46.9	Advance, O horses,
JER.46.9	and rage, O chariots!
JER.46.9	Let the warriors go forth:
JER.46.9	men of Ethiopia and Put who handle the shield,
JER.46.9	men of Lud, skilled in handling the bow.
JER.46.10	That day is the day of the Lord 
JER.46.10	a day of vengeance,
JER.46.10	to avenge himself on his foes.
JER.46.10	The sword shall devour and be sated,
JER.46.10	and drink its fill of their blood.
JER.46.10	For the Lord 
JER.46.10	in the north country by the river Euphrates.
JER.46.11	Go up to Gilead, and take balm,
JER.46.11	O virgin daughter of Egypt!
JER.46.11	in vain you have used many medicines;
JER.46.11	there is no healing for you.
JER.46.12	The nations have heard of your shame,
JER.46.12	and the earth is full of your cry;
JER.46.12	for warrior has stumbled against warrior;
JER.46.12	they have both fallen together.”
JER.46.13	The word which the 
JER.46.14	“Declare in Egypt, and proclaim in Migdol;
JER.46.14	proclaim in Memphis and Tahpanhes;
JER.46.14	Say, ‘Stand ready and be prepared,
JER.46.14	for the sword shall devour round about you.’
JER.46.15	Why has Apis fled?
JER.46.15	Why did not your bull stand?
JER.46.15	Because the 
JER.46.16	Your multitude stumbled
JER.46.16	and they said one to another,
JER.46.16	‘Arise, and let us go back to our own people
JER.46.16	and to the land of our birth,
JER.46.16	because of the sword of the oppressor.’
JER.46.17	Call the name of Pharaoh, king of Egypt,
JER.46.17	‘Noisy one who lets the hour go by.’
JER.46.18	“As I live, says the King,
JER.46.18	whose name is the 
JER.46.18	like Tabor among the mountains,
JER.46.18	and like Carmel by the sea, shall one come.
JER.46.19	Prepare yourselves baggage for exile,
JER.46.19	O inhabitants of Egypt!
JER.46.19	For Memphis shall become a waste,
JER.46.19	a ruin, without inhabitant.
JER.46.20	“A beautiful heifer is Egypt,
JER.46.20	but a gadfly from the north has come upon her.
JER.46.21	Even her hired soldiers in her midst
JER.46.21	are like fatted calves;
JER.46.21	yea, they have turned and fled together,
JER.46.21	they did not stand;
JER.46.21	for the day of their calamity has come upon them,
JER.46.21	the time of their punishment.
JER.46.22	“She makes a sound like a serpent gliding away;
JER.46.22	for her enemies march in force,
JER.46.22	and come against her with axes,
JER.46.22	like those who fell trees.
JER.46.23	They shall cut down her forest,
JER.46.23	says the 
JER.46.23	though it is impenetrable,
JER.46.23	because they are more numerous than locusts;
JER.46.23	they are without number.
JER.46.24	The daughter of Egypt shall be put to shame,
JER.46.24	she shall be delivered into the hand of a people from the north.”
JER.46.25	The 
JER.46.26	I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their life, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and his officers. Afterward Egypt shall be inhabited as in the days of old, says the 
JER.46.27	“But fear not, O Jacob my servant,
JER.46.27	nor be dismayed, O Israel;
JER.46.27	for lo, I will save you from afar,
JER.46.27	and your offspring from the land of their captivity.
JER.46.27	Jacob shall return and have quiet and ease,
JER.46.27	and none shall make him afraid.
JER.46.28	Fear not, O Jacob my servant,
JER.46.28	says the 
JER.46.28	for I am with you.
JER.46.28	I will make a full end of all the nations
JER.46.28	to which I have driven you,
JER.46.28	but of you I will not make a full end.
JER.46.28	I will chasten you in just measure,
JER.46.28	and I will by no means leave you unpunished.”
JER.47.2	“Thus says the 
JER.47.2	Behold, waters are rising out of the north,
JER.47.2	and shall become an overflowing torrent;
JER.47.2	they shall overflow the land and all that fills it,
JER.47.2	the city and those who dwell in it.
JER.47.2	Men shall cry out,
JER.47.2	and every inhabitant of the land shall wail.
JER.47.3	At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his stallions,
JER.47.3	at the rushing of his chariots, at the rumbling of their wheels,
JER.47.3	the fathers look not back to their children,
JER.47.3	so feeble are their hands,
JER.47.4	because of the day that is coming to destroy
JER.47.4	all the Philistines,
JER.47.4	to cut off from Tyre and Sidon
JER.47.4	every helper that remains.
JER.47.4	For the 
JER.47.4	the remnant of the coastland of Caphtor.
JER.47.5	Baldness has come upon Gaza,
JER.47.5	Ashkelon has perished.
JER.47.5	O remnant of the Anakim,
JER.47.5	how long will you gash yourselves?
JER.47.6	Ah, sword of the 
JER.47.6	How long till you are quiet?
JER.47.6	Put yourself into your scabbard,
JER.47.6	rest and be still!
JER.47.7	How can it
JER.47.7	when the 
JER.47.7	Against Ashkelon and against the seashore
JER.47.7	he has appointed it.”
JER.48.1	Thus says the 
JER.48.1	“Woe to Nebo, for it is laid waste!
JER.48.1	Kiriathaim is put to shame, it is taken;
JER.48.1	the fortress is put to shame and broken down;
JER.48.2	the renown of Moab is no more.
JER.48.2	In Heshbon they planned evil against her:
JER.48.2	‘Come, let us cut her off from being a nation!’
JER.48.2	You also, O Madmen, shall be brought to silence;
JER.48.2	the sword shall pursue you.
JER.48.3	“Hark! a cry from Horonaim,
JER.48.3	‘Desolation and great destruction!’
JER.48.4	Moab is destroyed;
JER.48.4	a cry is heard as far as Zoar.
JER.48.5	For at the ascent of Luhith
JER.48.5	they go up weeping;
JER.48.5	for at the descent of Horonaim
JER.48.5	they have heard the cry
JER.48.6	Flee! Save yourselves!
JER.48.6	Be like a wild ass
JER.48.7	For, because you trusted in your strongholds
JER.48.7	you also shall be taken;
JER.48.7	and Chemosh shall go forth into exile,
JER.48.7	with his priests and his princes.
JER.48.8	The destroyer shall come upon every city,
JER.48.8	and no city shall escape;
JER.48.8	the valley shall perish,
JER.48.8	and the plain shall be destroyed,
JER.48.8	as the 
JER.48.9	“Give wings to Moab,
JER.48.9	for she would fly away;
JER.48.9	her cities shall become a desolation,
JER.48.9	with no inhabitant in them.
JER.48.10	“Cursed is he who does the work of the 
JER.48.11	“Moab has been at ease from his youth
JER.48.11	and has settled on his lees;
JER.48.11	he has not been emptied from vessel to vessel,
JER.48.11	nor has he gone into exile;
JER.48.11	so his taste remains in him,
JER.48.11	and his scent is not changed.
JER.48.12	“Therefore, behold, the days are coming, says the 
JER.48.13	Then Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their confidence.
JER.48.14	“How do you say, ‘We are heroes
JER.48.14	and mighty men of war’?
JER.48.15	The destroyer of Moab and his cities has come up,
JER.48.15	and the choicest of his young men have gone down to slaughter,
JER.48.15	says the King, whose name is the 
JER.48.16	The calamity of Moab is near at hand
JER.48.16	and his affliction hastens apace.
JER.48.17	Bemoan him, all you who are round about him,
JER.48.17	and all who know his name;
JER.48.17	say, ‘How the mighty scepter is broken,
JER.48.17	the glorious staff.’
JER.48.18	“Come down from your glory,
JER.48.18	and sit on the parched ground,
JER.48.18	O inhabitant of Dibon!
JER.48.18	For the destroyer of Moab has come up against you;
JER.48.18	he has destroyed your strongholds.
JER.48.19	Stand by the way and watch,
JER.48.19	O inhabitant of Aroer!
JER.48.19	Ask him who flees and her who escapes;
JER.48.19	say, ‘What has happened?’
JER.48.20	Moab is put to shame, for it is broken;
JER.48.20	wail and cry!
JER.48.20	Tell it by the Arnon,
JER.48.20	that Moab is laid waste.
JER.48.21	“Judgment has come upon the tableland, upon Holon, and Jahzah, and Mepha-ath, 
JER.48.22	and Dibon, and Nebo, and Beth-diblathaim, 
JER.48.23	and Kiriathaim, and Beth-gamul, and Beth-meon, 
JER.48.24	and Keri-oth, and Bozrah, and all the cities of the land of Moab, far and near. 
JER.48.25	The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, says the 
JER.48.26	“Make him drunk, because he magnified himself against the 
JER.48.27	Was not Israel a derision to you? Was he found among thieves, that whenever you spoke of him you wagged your head?
JER.48.28	“Leave the cities, and dwell in the rock,
JER.48.28	O inhabitants of Moab!
JER.48.28	Be like the dove that nests
JER.48.28	in the sides of the mouth of a gorge.
JER.48.29	We have heard of the pride of Moab—
JER.48.29	he is very proud—
JER.48.29	of his loftiness, his pride, and his arrogance,
JER.48.29	and the haughtiness of his heart.
JER.48.30	I know his insolence, says the 
JER.48.30	his boasts are false,
JER.48.30	his deeds are false.
JER.48.31	Therefore I wail for Moab;
JER.48.31	I cry out for all Moab;
JER.48.31	for the men of Kir-heres I mourn.
JER.48.32	More than for Jazer I weep for you,
JER.48.32	O vine of Sibmah!
JER.48.32	Your branches passed over the sea,
JER.48.32	reached as far as Jazer;
JER.48.32	upon your summer fruits and your vintage
JER.48.32	the destroyer has fallen.
JER.48.33	Gladness and joy have been taken away
JER.48.33	from the fruitful land of Moab;
JER.48.33	I have made the wine cease from the wine presses;
JER.48.33	no one treads them with shouts of joy;
JER.48.33	the shouting is not the shout of joy.
JER.48.34	“Heshbon and Ele-aleh cry out;
JER.48.35	And I will bring to an end in Moab, says the 
JER.48.36	Therefore my heart moans for Moab like a flute, and my heart moans like a flute for the men of Kir-heres; therefore the riches they gained have perished.
JER.48.37	“For every head is shaved and every beard cut off; upon all the hands are gashes, and on the loins is sackcloth. 
JER.48.38	On all the housetops of Moab and in the squares there is nothing but lamentation; for I have broken Moab like a vessel for which no one cares, says the 
JER.48.39	How it is broken! How they wail! How Moab has turned his back in shame! So Moab has become a derision and a horror to all that are round about him.”
JER.48.40	For thus says the 
JER.48.40	“Behold, one shall fly swiftly like an eagle,
JER.48.40	and spread his wings against Moab;
JER.48.41	the cities shall be taken
JER.48.41	and the strongholds seized.
JER.48.41	The heart of the warriors of Moab shall be in that day
JER.48.41	like the heart of a woman in her pangs;
JER.48.42	Moab shall be destroyed and be no longer a people,
JER.48.42	because he magnified himself against the 
JER.48.43	Terror, pit, and snare
JER.48.43	are before you, O inhabitant of Moab!
JER.48.43	says the 
JER.48.44	He who flees from the terror
JER.48.44	shall fall into the pit,
JER.48.44	and he who climbs out of the pit
JER.48.44	shall be caught in the snare.
JER.48.44	For I will bring these things
JER.48.44	in the year of their punishment,
JER.48.44	says the 
JER.48.45	“In the shadow of Heshbon
JER.48.45	fugitives stop without strength;
JER.48.45	for a fire has gone forth from Heshbon,
JER.48.45	a flame from the house of Sihon;
JER.48.45	it has destroyed the forehead of Moab,
JER.48.45	the crown of the sons of tumult.
JER.48.46	Woe to you, O Moab!
JER.48.46	The people of Chemosh is undone;
JER.48.46	for your sons have been taken captive,
JER.48.46	and your daughters into captivity.
JER.48.47	Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab
JER.48.47	in the latter days, says the 
JER.48.47	Thus far is the judgment on Moab.
JER.49.1	Thus says the 
JER.49.1	“Has Israel no sons?
JER.49.1	Has he no heir?
JER.49.1	Why then has Milcom dispossessed Gad,
JER.49.1	and his people settled in its cities?
JER.49.2	Therefore, behold, the days are coming,
JER.49.2	says the 
JER.49.2	when I will cause the battle cry to be heard
JER.49.2	against Rabbah of the Ammonites;
JER.49.2	it shall become a desolate mound,
JER.49.2	and its villages shall be burned with fire;
JER.49.2	then Israel shall dispossess those who dispossessed him,
JER.49.2	says the 
JER.49.3	“Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste!
JER.49.3	Cry, O daughters of Rabbah!
JER.49.3	Gird yourselves with sackcloth,
JER.49.3	lament, and run to and fro among the hedges!
JER.49.3	For Milcom shall go into exile,
JER.49.3	with his priests and his princes.
JER.49.4	Why do you boast of your valleys,
JER.49.4	O faithless daughter,
JER.49.4	who trusted in her treasures, saying,
JER.49.4	‘Who will come against me?’
JER.49.5	Behold, I will bring terror upon you,
JER.49.5	says the Lord 
JER.49.5	from all who are round about you,
JER.49.5	and you shall be driven out, every man straight before him,
JER.49.5	with none to gather the fugitives.
JER.49.6	“But afterward I will restore the fortunes of the Ammonites, says the 
JER.49.7	Thus says the 
JER.49.7	“Is wisdom no more in Teman?
JER.49.7	Has counsel perished from the prudent?
JER.49.7	Has their wisdom vanished?
JER.49.8	Flee, turn back, dwell in the depths,
JER.49.8	O inhabitants of Dedan!
JER.49.8	For I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him,
JER.49.8	the time when I punish him.
JER.49.9	If grape-gatherers came to you,
JER.49.9	would they not leave gleanings?
JER.49.9	If thieves came by night,
JER.49.9	would they not destroy only enough for themselves?
JER.49.10	But I have stripped Esau bare,
JER.49.10	I have uncovered his hiding places,
JER.49.10	and he is not able to conceal himself.
JER.49.10	His children are destroyed, and his brothers,
JER.49.10	and his neighbors; and he is no more.
JER.49.11	Leave your fatherless children, I will keep them alive;
JER.49.11	and let your widows trust in me.”
JER.49.12	For thus says the 
JER.49.13	For I have sworn by myself, says the 
JER.49.14	I have heard tidings from the 
JER.49.14	and a messenger has been sent among the nations:
JER.49.14	“Gather yourselves together and come against her,
JER.49.14	and rise up for battle!”
JER.49.15	For behold, I will make you small among the nations,
JER.49.15	despised among men.
JER.49.16	The horror you inspire has deceived you,
JER.49.16	and the pride of your heart,
JER.49.16	you who live in the clefts of the rock,
JER.49.16	who hold the height of the hill.
JER.49.16	Though you make your nest as high as the eagle's,
JER.49.16	I will bring you down from there,
JER.49.16	says the 
JER.49.17	“Edom shall become a horror; every one who passes by it will be horrified and will hiss because of all its disasters. 
JER.49.18	As when Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbor cities were overthrown, says the 
JER.49.19	Behold, like a lion coming up from the jungle of the Jordan against a strong sheepfold, I will suddenly make them
JER.49.20	Therefore hear the plan which the 
JER.49.21	At the sound of their fall the earth shall tremble; the sound of their cry shall be heard at the Red Sea. 
JER.49.22	Behold, one shall mount up and fly swiftly like an eagle, and spread his wings against Bozrah, and the heart of the warriors of Edom shall be in that day like the heart of a woman in her pangs.”
JER.49.23	“Hamath and Arpad are confounded,
JER.49.23	for they have heard evil tidings;
JER.49.23	they melt in fear, they are troubled like the sea
JER.49.23	which cannot be quiet.
JER.49.24	Damascus has become feeble, she turned to flee,
JER.49.24	and panic seized her;
JER.49.24	anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her,
JER.49.24	as of a woman in travail.
JER.49.25	How the famous city is forsaken,
JER.49.25	the joyful city!
JER.49.26	Therefore her young men shall fall in her squares,
JER.49.26	and all her soldiers shall be destroyed in that day,
JER.49.26	says the 
JER.49.27	And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus,
JER.49.27	and it shall devour the strongholds of Ben-hadad.”
JER.49.28	Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote.
JER.49.28	Thus says the 
JER.49.28	“Rise up, advance against Kedar!
JER.49.28	Destroy the people of the east!
JER.49.29	their curtains and all their goods;
JER.49.29	their camels shall be borne away from them,
JER.49.29	and men shall cry to them: ‘Terror on every side!’
JER.49.30	Flee, wander far away, dwell in the depths,
JER.49.30	O inhabitants of Hazor!
JER.49.30	says the 
JER.49.30	For Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon
JER.49.30	has made a plan against you,
JER.49.30	and formed a purpose against you.
JER.49.31	“Rise up, advance against a nation at ease,
JER.49.31	that dwells securely,
JER.49.31	says the 
JER.49.31	that has no gates or bars,
JER.49.31	that dwells alone.
JER.49.32	Their camels shall become booty,
JER.49.32	their herds of cattle a spoil.
JER.49.32	I will scatter to every wind
JER.49.32	those who cut the corners of their hair,
JER.49.32	and I will bring their calamity
JER.49.32	from every side of them,
JER.49.32	says the 
JER.49.33	Hazor shall become a haunt of jackals,
JER.49.33	an everlasting waste;
JER.49.33	no man shall dwell there,
JER.49.33	no man shall sojourn in her.”
JER.49.34	The word of the 
JER.49.35	Thus says the 
JER.49.36	and I will bring upon Elam the four winds from the four quarters of heaven; and I will scatter them to all those winds, and there shall be no nation to which those driven out of Elam shall not come. 
JER.49.37	I will terrify Elam before their enemies, and before those who seek their life; I will bring evil upon them, my fierce anger, says the 
JER.49.38	and I will set my throne in Elam, and destroy their king and princes, says the 
JER.49.39	“But in the latter days I will restore the fortunes of Elam, says the 
JER.50.2	“Declare among the nations and proclaim,
JER.50.2	set up a banner and proclaim,
JER.50.2	conceal it not, and say:
JER.50.2	‘Babylon is taken,
JER.50.2	Bel is put to shame,
JER.50.2	Merodach is dismayed.
JER.50.2	Her images are put to shame,
JER.50.2	her idols are dismayed.’
JER.50.3	“For out of the north a nation has come up against her, which shall make her land a desolation, and none shall dwell in it; both man and beast shall flee away.
JER.50.4	“In those days and in that time, says the 
JER.50.5	They shall ask the way to Zion, with faces turned toward it, saying, ‘Come, let us join ourselves to the 
JER.50.6	“My people have been lost sheep; their shepherds have led them astray, turning them away on the mountains; from mountain to hill they have gone, they have forgotten their fold. 
JER.50.7	All who found them have devoured them, and their enemies have said, ‘We are not guilty, for they have sinned against the 
JER.50.9	For behold, I am stirring up and bringing against Babylon a company of great nations, from the north country; and they shall array themselves against her; from there she shall be taken. Their arrows are like a skilled warrior who does not return empty-handed. 
JER.50.10	Chaldea shall be plundered; all who plunder her shall be sated, says the 
JER.50.11	“Though you rejoice, though you exult,
JER.50.11	O plunderers of my heritage,
JER.50.11	though you are wanton as a heifer at grass,
JER.50.11	and neigh like stallions,
JER.50.12	your mother shall be utterly shamed,
JER.50.12	and she who bore you shall be disgraced.
JER.50.12	Lo, she shall be the last of the nations,
JER.50.12	a wilderness dry and desert.
JER.50.13	Because of the wrath of the 
JER.50.13	but shall be an utter desolation;
JER.50.13	every one who passes by Babylon shall be appalled,
JER.50.13	and hiss because of all her wounds.
JER.50.14	Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about,
JER.50.14	all you that bend the bow;
JER.50.14	shoot at her, spare no arrows,
JER.50.14	for she has sinned against the 
JER.50.15	Raise a shout against her round about,
JER.50.15	she has surrendered;
JER.50.15	her bulwarks have fallen,
JER.50.15	her walls are thrown down.
JER.50.15	For this is the vengeance of the 
JER.50.15	take vengeance on her,
JER.50.15	do to her as she has done.
JER.50.16	Cut off from Babylon the sower,
JER.50.16	and the one who handles the sickle in time of harvest;
JER.50.16	because of the sword of the oppressor,
JER.50.16	every one shall turn to his own people,
JER.50.16	and every one shall flee to his own land.
JER.50.17	“Israel is a hunted sheep driven away by lions. First the king of Assyria devoured him, and now at last Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon has gnawed his bones. 
JER.50.18	Therefore, thus says the 
JER.50.19	I will restore Israel to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and in Bashan, and his desire shall be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead. 
JER.50.20	In those days and in that time, says the 
JER.50.21	“Go up against the land of Merathaim,
JER.50.21	and against the inhabitants of Pekod.
JER.50.21	Slay, and utterly destroy after them,
JER.50.21	says the 
JER.50.21	and do all that I have commanded you.
JER.50.22	The noise of battle is in the land,
JER.50.22	and great destruction!
JER.50.23	How the hammer of the whole earth
JER.50.23	is cut down and broken!
JER.50.23	How Babylon has become
JER.50.23	a horror among the nations!
JER.50.24	I set a snare for you and you were taken, O Babylon,
JER.50.24	and you did not know it;
JER.50.24	you were found and caught,
JER.50.24	because you strove against the 
JER.50.25	The 
JER.50.25	and brought out the weapons of his wrath,
JER.50.25	for the Lord 
JER.50.25	in the land of the Chaldeans.
JER.50.26	Come against her from every quarter;
JER.50.26	open her granaries;
JER.50.26	pile her up like heaps of grain, and destroy her utterly;
JER.50.26	let nothing be left of her.
JER.50.27	Slay all her bulls,
JER.50.27	let them go down to the slaughter.
JER.50.27	Woe to them, for their day has come,
JER.50.27	the time of their punishment.
JER.50.28	“Hark! they flee and escape from the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the 
JER.50.29	“Summon archers against Babylon, all those who bend the bow. Encamp round about her; let no one escape. Requite her according to her deeds, do to her according to all that she has done; for she has proudly defied the 
JER.50.30	Therefore her young men shall fall in her squares, and all her soldiers shall be destroyed on that day, says the 
JER.50.31	“Behold, I am against you, O proud one,
JER.50.31	says the Lord 
JER.50.31	for your day has come,
JER.50.31	the time when I will punish you.
JER.50.32	The proud one shall stumble and fall,
JER.50.32	with none to raise him up,
JER.50.32	and I will kindle a fire in his cities,
JER.50.32	and it will devour all that is round about him.
JER.50.33	“Thus says the 
JER.50.34	Their Redeemer is strong; the 
JER.50.35	“A sword upon the Chaldeans, says the 
JER.50.35	and upon the inhabitants of Babylon,
JER.50.35	and upon her princes and her wise men!
JER.50.36	A sword upon the diviners,
JER.50.36	that they may become fools!
JER.50.36	A sword upon her warriors,
JER.50.36	that they may be destroyed!
JER.50.37	A sword upon her horses and upon her chariots,
JER.50.37	and upon all the foreign troops in her midst,
JER.50.37	that they may become women!
JER.50.37	A sword upon all her treasures,
JER.50.37	that they may be plundered!
JER.50.38	A drought upon her waters,
JER.50.38	that they may be dried up!
JER.50.38	For it is a land of images,
JER.50.38	and they are mad over idols.
JER.50.39	“Therefore wild beasts shall dwell with hyenas in Babylon, and ostriches shall dwell in her; she shall be peopled no more for ever, nor inhabited for all generations. 
JER.50.40	As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbor cities, says the 
JER.50.41	“Behold, a people comes from the north;
JER.50.41	a mighty nation and many kings
JER.50.41	are stirring from the farthest parts of the earth.
JER.50.42	They lay hold of bow and spear;
JER.50.42	they are cruel, and have no mercy.
JER.50.42	The sound of them is like the roaring of the sea;
JER.50.42	they ride upon horses,
JER.50.42	arrayed as a man for battle
JER.50.42	against you, O daughter of Babylon!
JER.50.43	“The king of Babylon heard the report of them,
JER.50.43	and his hands fell helpless;
JER.50.43	anguish seized him,
JER.50.43	pain as of a woman in travail.
JER.50.44	“Behold, like a lion coming up from the jungle of the Jordan against a strong sheepfold, I will suddenly make them run away from her; and I will appoint over her whomever I choose. For who is like me? Who will summon me? What shepherd can stand before me? 
JER.50.45	Therefore hear the plan which the 
JER.50.46	At the sound of the capture of Babylon the earth shall tremble, and her cry shall be heard among the nations.”
JER.51.1	Thus says the 
JER.51.1	“Behold, I will stir up the spirit of a destroyer
JER.51.1	against Babylon,
JER.51.1	against the inhabitants of Chaldea;
JER.51.2	and I will send to Babylon winnowers,
JER.51.2	and they shall winnow her,
JER.51.2	and they shall empty her land,
JER.51.2	when they come against her from every side
JER.51.2	on the day of trouble.
JER.51.3	Let not the archer bend his bow,
JER.51.3	and let him not stand up in his coat of mail.
JER.51.3	Spare not her young men;
JER.51.3	utterly destroy all her host.
JER.51.4	They shall fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans,
JER.51.4	and wounded in her streets.
JER.51.5	For Israel and Judah have not been forsaken
JER.51.5	by their God, the 
JER.51.5	but the land of the Chaldeans
JER.51.5	against the Holy One of Israel.
JER.51.6	let every man save his life!
JER.51.6	Be not cut off in her punishment,
JER.51.6	for this is the time of the 
JER.51.6	the requital he is rendering her.
JER.51.7	making all the earth drunken;
JER.51.7	the nations drank of her wine,
JER.51.7	therefore the nations went mad.
JER.51.8	Suddenly Babylon has fallen and been broken;
JER.51.8	wail for her!
JER.51.8	Take balm for her pain;
JER.51.8	perhaps she may be healed.
JER.51.9	We would have healed Babylon,
JER.51.9	but she was not healed.
JER.51.9	Forsake her, and let us go
JER.51.9	each to his own country;
JER.51.9	for her judgment has reached up to heaven
JER.51.9	and has been lifted up even to the skies.
JER.51.10	The 
JER.51.10	come, let us declare in Zion
JER.51.10	the work of the 
JER.51.11	“Sharpen the arrows!
JER.51.11	Take up the shields!
JER.51.11	The 
JER.51.12	Set up a standard against the walls of Babylon;
JER.51.12	make the watch strong;
JER.51.12	set up watchmen;
JER.51.12	prepare the ambushes;
JER.51.12	for the 
JER.51.12	what he spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.
JER.51.13	rich in treasures,
JER.51.13	your end has come,
JER.51.13	the thread of your life is cut.
JER.51.14	The 
JER.51.14	Surely I will fill you with men, as many as locusts,
JER.51.14	and they shall raise the shout of victory over you.
JER.51.15	“It is he who made the earth by his power,
JER.51.15	who established the world by his wisdom,
JER.51.15	and by his understanding
JER.51.15	stretched out the heavens.
JER.51.16	When he utters his voice there is a tumult of waters in the heavens,
JER.51.16	and he makes the mist rise from the ends of the earth.
JER.51.16	He makes lightnings for the rain,
JER.51.16	and he brings forth the wind from his storehouses.
JER.51.17	Every man is stupid and without knowledge;
JER.51.17	every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols;
JER.51.17	for his images are false,
JER.51.17	and there is no breath in them.
JER.51.18	They are worthless, a work of delusion;
JER.51.18	at the time of their punishment they shall perish.
JER.51.19	Not like these is he who is the portion of Jacob,
JER.51.19	for he is the one who formed all things,
JER.51.19	and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance;
JER.51.19	the 
JER.51.20	“You are my hammer and weapon of war:
JER.51.20	with you I break nations in pieces;
JER.51.20	with you I destroy kingdoms;
JER.51.21	with you I break in pieces the horse and his rider;
JER.51.21	with you I break in pieces the chariot and the charioteer;
JER.51.22	with you I break in pieces man and woman;
JER.51.22	with you I break in pieces the old man and the youth;
JER.51.22	with you I break in pieces the young man and the maiden;
JER.51.23	with you I break in pieces the shepherd and his flock;
JER.51.23	with you I break in pieces the farmer and his team;
JER.51.23	with you I break in pieces governors and commanders.
JER.51.24	“I will requite Babylon and all the inhabitants of Chaldea before your very eyes for all the evil that they have done in Zion, says the 
JER.51.25	“Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain,
JER.51.25	says the 
JER.51.25	which destroys the whole earth;
JER.51.25	I will stretch out my hand against you,
JER.51.25	and roll you down from the crags,
JER.51.25	and make you a burnt mountain.
JER.51.26	No stone shall be taken from you for a corner
JER.51.26	and no stone for a foundation,
JER.51.26	but you shall be a perpetual waste,
JER.51.26	says the 
JER.51.27	“Set up a standard on the earth,
JER.51.27	blow the trumpet among the nations;
JER.51.27	prepare the nations for war against her,
JER.51.27	summon against her the kingdoms,
JER.51.27	Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz;
JER.51.27	appoint a marshal against her,
JER.51.27	bring up horses like bristling locusts.
JER.51.28	Prepare the nations for war against her,
JER.51.28	the kings of the Medes, with their governors and deputies,
JER.51.28	and every land under their dominion.
JER.51.29	The land trembles and writhes in pain,
JER.51.29	for the 
JER.51.29	to make the land of Babylon a desolation,
JER.51.29	without inhabitant.
JER.51.30	The warriors of Babylon have ceased fighting,
JER.51.30	they remain in their strongholds;
JER.51.30	their strength has failed,
JER.51.30	they have become women;
JER.51.30	her dwellings are on fire,
JER.51.30	her bars are broken.
JER.51.31	One runner runs to meet another,
JER.51.31	and one messenger to meet another,
JER.51.31	to tell the king of Babylon
JER.51.31	that his city is taken on every side;
JER.51.32	the fords have been seized,
JER.51.32	the bulwarks are burned with fire,
JER.51.32	and the soldiers are in panic.
JER.51.33	For thus says the 
JER.51.33	The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor
JER.51.33	at the time when it is trodden;
JER.51.33	yet a little while
JER.51.33	and the time of her harvest will come.”
JER.51.34	“Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me,
JER.51.34	he has crushed me;
JER.51.34	he has made me an empty vessel,
JER.51.34	he has swallowed me like a monster;
JER.51.34	he has filled his belly with my delicacies,
JER.51.34	he has rinsed me out.
JER.51.35	The violence done to me and to my kinsmen be upon Babylon,”
JER.51.35	let the inhabitant of Zion say.
JER.51.35	“My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea,”
JER.51.35	let Jerusalem say.
JER.51.36	Therefore thus says the 
JER.51.36	“Behold, I will plead your cause and take vengeance for you.
JER.51.36	I will dry up her sea
JER.51.36	and make her fountain dry;
JER.51.37	and Babylon shall become a heap of ruins,
JER.51.37	the haunt of jackals,
JER.51.37	a horror and a hissing,
JER.51.37	without inhabitant.
JER.51.38	“They shall roar together like lions;
JER.51.38	they shall growl like lions' whelps.
JER.51.39	While they are inflamed I will prepare them a feast
JER.51.39	and make them drunk, till they swoon away
JER.51.39	and sleep a perpetual sleep
JER.51.39	and not wake, says the 
JER.51.40	I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter,
JER.51.40	like rams and he-goats.
JER.51.41	“How Babylon
JER.51.41	the praise of the whole earth seized!
JER.51.41	How Babylon has become
JER.51.41	a horror among the nations!
JER.51.42	The sea has come up on Babylon;
JER.51.42	she is covered with its tumultuous waves.
JER.51.43	Her cities have become a horror,
JER.51.43	a land of drought and a desert,
JER.51.43	a land in which no one dwells,
JER.51.43	and through which no son of man passes.
JER.51.44	And I will punish Bel in Babylon,
JER.51.44	and take out of his mouth what he has swallowed.
JER.51.44	The nations shall no longer flow to him;
JER.51.44	the wall of Babylon has fallen.
JER.51.45	“Go out of the midst of her, my people!
JER.51.45	Let every man save his life
JER.51.45	from the fierce anger of the 
JER.51.46	Let not your heart faint, and be not fearful
JER.51.46	at the report heard in the land,
JER.51.46	when a report comes in one year
JER.51.46	and afterward a report in another year,
JER.51.46	and violence is in the land,
JER.51.46	and ruler is against ruler.
JER.51.47	“Therefore, behold, the days are coming
JER.51.47	when I will punish the images of Babylon;
JER.51.47	her whole land shall be put to shame,
JER.51.47	and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.
JER.51.48	and all that is in them,
JER.51.48	shall sing for joy over Babylon;
JER.51.48	for the destroyers shall come against them out of the north,
JER.51.48	says the 
JER.51.49	Babylon must fall for the slain of Israel,
JER.51.49	as for Babylon have fallen the slain of all the earth.
JER.51.50	“You that have escaped from the sword,
JER.51.50	go, stand not still!
JER.51.50	Remember the 
JER.51.50	and let Jerusalem come into your mind:
JER.51.51	‘We are put to shame, for we have heard reproach;
JER.51.51	dishonor has covered our face,
JER.51.51	for aliens have come
JER.51.51	into the holy places of the

JER.51.52	when I will execute judgment upon her images,
JER.51.52	and through all her land
JER.51.52	the wounded shall groan.
JER.51.53	Though Babylon should mount up to heaven,
JER.51.53	and though she should fortify her strong height,
JER.51.53	yet destroyers would come from me upon her,
JER.51.53	says the 
JER.51.54	“Hark! a cry from Babylon!
JER.51.54	The noise of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!
JER.51.55	For the 
JER.51.55	and stilling her mighty voice.
JER.51.55	Their waves roar like many waters,
JER.51.55	the noise of their voice is raised;
JER.51.56	for a destroyer has come upon her,
JER.51.56	upon Babylon;
JER.51.56	her warriors are taken,
JER.51.56	their bows are broken in pieces;
JER.51.56	for the 
JER.51.56	he will surely requite.
JER.51.57	I will make drunk her princes and her wise men,
JER.51.57	her governors, her commanders, and her warriors;
JER.51.57	they shall sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake,
JER.51.57	says the King, whose name is the 
JER.51.58	“Thus says the 
JER.51.58	The broad wall of Babylon
JER.51.58	shall be leveled to the ground
JER.51.58	and her high gates
JER.51.58	shall be burned with fire.
JER.51.58	The peoples labor for naught,
JER.51.58	and the nations weary themselves only for fire.”
JER.51.59	The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah king of Judah to Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign. Seraiah was the quartermaster. 
JER.51.60	Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, all these words that are written concerning Babylon. 
JER.51.61	And Jeremiah said to Seraiah: “When you come to Babylon, see that you read all these words, 
JER.51.62	and say, ‘O 
JER.51.63	 When you finish reading this book, bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates, 
JER.51.64	and say, ‘Thus shall Babylon sink, to rise no more, because of the evil that I am bringing upon her.’ ”
JER.51.64	Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.
JER.52.1	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
JER.52.2	 And he did what was evil in the sight of the 
JER.52.3	Surely because of the anger of the 
JER.52.3	And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. 
JER.52.4	And in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem, and they laid siege to it and built siegeworks against it round about. 
JER.52.5	So the city was besieged till the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. 
JER.52.6	On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city, that there was no food for the people of the land. 
JER.52.7	Then a breach was made in the city; and all the men of war fled and went out from the city by night by the way of a gate between the two walls, by the king's garden, while the Chaldeans were round about the city. And they went in the direction of the Arabah. 
JER.52.8	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him. 
JER.52.9	Then they captured the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence upon him. 
JER.52.10	The king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and also slew all the princes of Judah at Riblah. 
JER.52.11	He put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters, and the king of Babylon took him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.
JER.52.12	In the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month—which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon—Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard who served the king of Babylon, entered Jerusalem. 
JER.52.13	And he burned the house of the 
JER.52.14	And all the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls round about Jerusalem. 
JER.52.15	And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive some of the poorest of the people and the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, together with the rest of the artisans. 
JER.52.16	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen.
JER.52.17	And the pillars of bronze that were in the house of the 
JER.52.18	And they took away the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the dishes for incense, and all the vessels of bronze used in the temple service; 
JER.52.19	also the small bowls, and the firepans, and the basins, and the pots, and the lampstands, and the dishes for incense, and the bowls for libation. What was of gold the captain of the guard took away as gold, and what was of silver, as silver. 
JER.52.20	As for the two pillars, the one sea, the twelve bronze bulls which were under the sea,
JER.52.21	As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, its circumference was twelve cubits, and its thickness was four fingers, and it was hollow. 
JER.52.22	Upon it was a capital of bronze; the height of the one capital was five cubits; a network and pomegranates, all of bronze, were upon the capital round about. And the second pillar had the like, with pomegranates. 
JER.52.23	There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were a hundred upon the network round about.
JER.52.24	And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold; 
JER.52.25	and from the city he took an officer who had been in command of the men of war, and seven men of the king's council, who were found in the city; and the secretary of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the midst of the city. 
JER.52.26	And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
JER.52.27	And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried captive out of its land.
JER.52.28	This is the number of the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews; 
JER.52.29	in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons; 
JER.52.30	in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadrezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred and forty-five persons; all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.
JER.52.31	And in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he became king, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison; 
JER.52.32	and he spoke kindly to him, and gave him a seat above the seats of the kings who were with him in Babylon. 
JER.52.33	So Jehoiachin put off his prison garments. And every day of his life he dined regularly at the king's table; 
JER.52.34	as for his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king according to his daily need, until the day of his death as long as he lived.
LAM.1.1	How lonely sits the city
LAM.1.1	that was full of people!
LAM.1.1	How like a widow has she become,
LAM.1.1	she that was great among the nations!
LAM.1.1	She that was a princess among the cities
LAM.1.1	has become a vassal.
LAM.1.2	She weeps bitterly in the night,
LAM.1.2	tears on her cheeks;
LAM.1.2	among all her lovers
LAM.1.2	she has none to comfort her;
LAM.1.2	all her friends have dealt treacherously with her,
LAM.1.2	they have become her enemies.
LAM.1.3	Judah has gone into exile because of affliction
LAM.1.3	and hard servitude;
LAM.1.3	she dwells now among the nations,
LAM.1.3	but finds no resting place;
LAM.1.3	her pursuers have all overtaken her
LAM.1.3	in the midst of her distress.
LAM.1.4	The roads to Zion mourn,
LAM.1.4	for none come to the appointed feasts;
LAM.1.4	all her gates are desolate,
LAM.1.4	her priests groan;
LAM.1.4	her maidens have been dragged away,
LAM.1.4	and she herself suffers bitterly.
LAM.1.5	Her foes have become the head,
LAM.1.5	her enemies prosper,
LAM.1.5	because the 
LAM.1.5	for the multitude of her transgressions;
LAM.1.5	her children have gone away,
LAM.1.5	captives before the foe.
LAM.1.6	From the daughter of Zion has departed
LAM.1.6	all her majesty.
LAM.1.6	Her princes have become like harts
LAM.1.6	that find no pasture;
LAM.1.6	they fled without strength
LAM.1.6	before the pursuer.
LAM.1.7	Jerusalem remembers
LAM.1.7	in the days of her affliction and bitterness
LAM.1.7	all the precious things
LAM.1.7	that were hers from days of old.
LAM.1.7	When her people fell into the hand of the foe,
LAM.1.7	and there was none to help her,
LAM.1.7	the foe gloated over her,
LAM.1.7	mocking at her downfall.
LAM.1.8	Jerusalem sinned grievously,
LAM.1.8	therefore she became filthy;
LAM.1.8	all who honored her despise her,
LAM.1.8	for they have seen her nakedness;
LAM.1.8	yea, she herself groans,
LAM.1.8	and turns her face away.
LAM.1.9	Her uncleanness was in her skirts;
LAM.1.9	she took no thought of her doom;
LAM.1.9	therefore her fall is terrible,
LAM.1.9	she has no comforter.
LAM.1.9	“O 
LAM.1.9	for the enemy has triumphed!”
LAM.1.10	The enemy has stretched out his hands
LAM.1.10	over all her precious things;
LAM.1.10	yea, she has seen the nations
LAM.1.10	invade her sanctuary,
LAM.1.10	those whom thou didst forbid
LAM.1.10	to enter thy congregation.
LAM.1.11	All her people groan
LAM.1.11	as they search for bread;
LAM.1.11	they trade their treasures for food
LAM.1.11	to revive their strength.
LAM.1.11	“Look, O 
LAM.1.11	for I am despised.”
LAM.1.12	“Is it nothing to you,
LAM.1.12	Look and see
LAM.1.12	if there is any sorrow like my sorrow
LAM.1.12	which was brought upon me,
LAM.1.12	which the 
LAM.1.12	on the day of his fierce anger.
LAM.1.13	“From on high he sent fire;
LAM.1.13	into my bones
LAM.1.13	he spread a net for my feet;
LAM.1.13	he turned me back;
LAM.1.13	he has left me stunned,
LAM.1.13	faint all the day long.
LAM.1.14	“My transgressions were bound
LAM.1.14	by his hand they were fastened together;
LAM.1.14	they were set upon my neck;
LAM.1.14	he caused my strength to fail;
LAM.1.14	the Lord gave me into the hands
LAM.1.14	of those whom I cannot withstand.
LAM.1.15	“The Lord flouted all my mighty men
LAM.1.15	in the midst of me;
LAM.1.15	he summoned an assembly against me
LAM.1.15	to crush my young men;
LAM.1.15	the Lord has trodden as in a wine press
LAM.1.15	the virgin daughter of Judah.
LAM.1.16	“For these things I weep;
LAM.1.16	my eyes flow with tears;
LAM.1.16	for a comforter is far from me,
LAM.1.16	one to revive my courage;
LAM.1.16	my children are desolate,
LAM.1.16	for the enemy has prevailed.”
LAM.1.17	Zion stretches out her hands,
LAM.1.17	but there is none to comfort her;
LAM.1.17	the 
LAM.1.17	that his neighbors should be his foes;
LAM.1.17	Jerusalem has become
LAM.1.17	a filthy thing among them.
LAM.1.18	“The 
LAM.1.18	for I have rebelled against his word;
LAM.1.18	but hear, all you peoples,
LAM.1.18	and behold my suffering;
LAM.1.18	my maidens and my young men
LAM.1.18	have gone into captivity.
LAM.1.19	“I called to my lovers
LAM.1.19	but they deceived me;
LAM.1.19	my priests and elders
LAM.1.19	perished in the city,
LAM.1.19	while they sought food
LAM.1.19	to revive their strength.
LAM.1.20	“Behold, O 
LAM.1.20	my soul is in tumult,
LAM.1.20	my heart is wrung within me,
LAM.1.20	because I have been very rebellious.
LAM.1.20	In the street the sword bereaves;
LAM.1.20	in the house it is like death.
LAM.1.21	“Hear
LAM.1.21	there is none to comfort me.
LAM.1.21	All my enemies have heard of my trouble;
LAM.1.21	they are glad that thou hast done it.
LAM.1.21	Bring thou
LAM.1.21	and let them be as I am.
LAM.1.22	“Let all their evil-doing come before thee;
LAM.1.22	and deal with them
LAM.1.22	as thou hast dealt with me
LAM.1.22	because of all my transgressions;
LAM.1.22	for my groans are many
LAM.1.22	and my heart is faint.”
LAM.2.1	How the Lord in his anger
LAM.2.1	has set the daughter of Zion under a cloud!
LAM.2.1	He has cast down from heaven to earth
LAM.2.1	the splendor of Israel;
LAM.2.1	he has not remembered his footstool
LAM.2.1	in the day of his anger.
LAM.2.2	The Lord has destroyed without mercy
LAM.2.2	all the habitations of Jacob;
LAM.2.2	in his wrath he has broken down
LAM.2.2	the strongholds of the daughter of Judah;
LAM.2.2	he has brought down to the ground in dishonor
LAM.2.2	the kingdom and its rulers.
LAM.2.3	He has cut down in fierce anger
LAM.2.3	all the might of Israel;
LAM.2.3	he has withdrawn from them his right hand
LAM.2.3	in the face of the enemy;
LAM.2.3	he has burned like a flaming fire in Jacob,
LAM.2.3	consuming all around.
LAM.2.4	He has bent his bow like an enemy,
LAM.2.4	with his right hand set like a foe;
LAM.2.4	and he has slain all the pride of our eyes
LAM.2.4	in the tent of the daughter of Zion;
LAM.2.4	he has poured out his fury like fire.
LAM.2.5	The Lord has become like an enemy,
LAM.2.5	he has destroyed Israel;
LAM.2.5	he has destroyed all its palaces,
LAM.2.5	laid in ruins its strongholds;
LAM.2.5	and he has multiplied in the daughter of Judah
LAM.2.5	mourning and lamentation.
LAM.2.6	He has broken down his booth like that of a garden,
LAM.2.6	laid in ruins the place of his appointed feasts;
LAM.2.6	the 
LAM.2.6	appointed feast and sabbath,
LAM.2.6	and in his fierce indignation has spurned
LAM.2.6	king and priest.
LAM.2.7	The Lord has scorned his altar,
LAM.2.7	disowned his sanctuary;
LAM.2.7	he has delivered into the hand of the enemy
LAM.2.7	the walls of her palaces;
LAM.2.7	a clamor was raised in the house of the 
LAM.2.7	as on the day of an appointed feast.
LAM.2.8	The 
LAM.2.8	the wall of the daughter of Zion;
LAM.2.8	he marked it off by the line;
LAM.2.8	he restrained not his hand from destroying;
LAM.2.8	he caused rampart and wall to lament,
LAM.2.8	they languish together.
LAM.2.9	Her gates have sunk into the ground;
LAM.2.9	he has ruined and broken her bars;
LAM.2.9	her king and princes are among the nations;
LAM.2.9	the law is no more,
LAM.2.9	and her prophets obtain
LAM.2.9	no vision from the 
LAM.2.10	The elders of the daughter of Zion
LAM.2.10	sit on the ground in silence;
LAM.2.10	they have cast dust on their heads
LAM.2.10	and put on sackcloth;
LAM.2.10	the maidens of Jerusalem
LAM.2.10	have bowed their heads to the ground.
LAM.2.11	My eyes are spent with weeping;
LAM.2.11	my soul is in tumult;
LAM.2.11	my heart is poured out in grief
LAM.2.11	because of the destruction of the daughter of my people,
LAM.2.11	because infants and babes faint
LAM.2.11	in the streets of the city.
LAM.2.12	They cry to their mothers,
LAM.2.12	“Where is bread and wine?”
LAM.2.12	as they faint like wounded men
LAM.2.12	in the streets of the city,
LAM.2.12	as their life is poured out
LAM.2.12	on their mothers' bosom.
LAM.2.13	What can I say for you, to what compare you,
LAM.2.13	O daughter of Jerusalem?
LAM.2.13	What can I liken to you, that I may comfort you,
LAM.2.13	O virgin daughter of Zion?
LAM.2.13	For vast as the sea is your ruin;
LAM.2.13	who can restore you?
LAM.2.14	Your prophets have seen for you
LAM.2.14	false and deceptive visions;
LAM.2.14	they have not exposed your iniquity
LAM.2.14	to restore your fortunes,
LAM.2.14	but have seen for you oracles
LAM.2.14	false and misleading.
LAM.2.15	All who pass along the way
LAM.2.15	clap their hands at you;
LAM.2.15	they hiss and wag their heads
LAM.2.15	at the daughter of Jerusalem;
LAM.2.15	“Is this the city which was called
LAM.2.15	the perfection of beauty,
LAM.2.15	the joy of all the earth?”
LAM.2.16	All your enemies
LAM.2.16	rail against you;
LAM.2.16	they hiss, they gnash their teeth,
LAM.2.16	they cry: “We have destroyed her!
LAM.2.16	Ah, this is the day we longed for;
LAM.2.16	now we have it; we see it!”
LAM.2.17	The 
LAM.2.17	has carried out his threat;
LAM.2.17	as he ordained long ago,
LAM.2.17	he has demolished without pity;
LAM.2.17	he has made the enemy rejoice over you,
LAM.2.17	and exalted the might of your foes.
LAM.2.18	Cry aloud
LAM.2.18	O
LAM.2.18	Let tears stream down like a torrent
LAM.2.18	day and night!
LAM.2.18	Give yourself no rest,
LAM.2.18	your eyes no respite!
LAM.2.19	Arise, cry out in the night,
LAM.2.19	at the beginning of the watches!
LAM.2.19	Pour out your heart like water
LAM.2.19	before the presence of the Lord!
LAM.2.19	Lift your hands to him
LAM.2.19	for the lives of your children,
LAM.2.19	who faint for hunger
LAM.2.19	at the head of every street.
LAM.2.20	Look, O 
LAM.2.20	With whom hast thou dealt thus?
LAM.2.20	Should women eat their offspring,
LAM.2.20	the children of their tender care?
LAM.2.20	Should priest and prophet be slain
LAM.2.20	in the sanctuary of the Lord?
LAM.2.21	In the dust of the streets
LAM.2.21	lie the young and the old;
LAM.2.21	my maidens and my young men
LAM.2.21	have fallen by the sword;
LAM.2.21	in the day of thy anger thou hast slain them,
LAM.2.21	slaughtering without mercy.
LAM.2.22	Thou didst invite as to the day of an appointed feast
LAM.2.22	my terrors on every side;
LAM.2.22	and on the day of the anger of the 
LAM.2.22	none escaped or survived;
LAM.2.22	those whom I dandled and reared
LAM.2.22	my enemy destroyed.
LAM.3.1	I am the man who has seen affliction
LAM.3.1	under the rod of his wrath;
LAM.3.2	he has driven and brought me
LAM.3.2	into darkness without any light;
LAM.3.3	surely against me he turns his hand
LAM.3.3	again and again the whole day long.
LAM.3.4	He has made my flesh and my skin waste away,
LAM.3.4	and broken my bones;
LAM.3.5	he has beseiged and enveloped me
LAM.3.5	with bitterness and tribulation;
LAM.3.6	he has made me dwell in darkness
LAM.3.6	like the dead of long ago.
LAM.3.7	He has walled me about so that I cannot escape;
LAM.3.7	he has put heavy chains on me;
LAM.3.8	though I call and cry for help,
LAM.3.8	he shuts out my prayer;
LAM.3.9	he has blocked my ways with hewn stones,
LAM.3.9	he has made my paths crooked.
LAM.3.10	He is to me like a bear lying in wait,
LAM.3.10	like a lion in hiding;
LAM.3.11	he led me off my way and tore me to pieces;
LAM.3.11	he has made me desolate;
LAM.3.12	he bent his bow and set me
LAM.3.12	as a mark for his arrow.
LAM.3.13	He drove into my heart
LAM.3.13	the arrows of his quiver;
LAM.3.14	I have become the laughingstock of all peoples,
LAM.3.14	the burden of their songs all day long.
LAM.3.15	He has filled me with bitterness,
LAM.3.15	he has sated me with wormwood.
LAM.3.16	He has made my teeth grind on gravel,
LAM.3.16	and made me cower in ashes;
LAM.3.17	my soul is bereft of peace,
LAM.3.17	I have forgotten what happiness is;
LAM.3.18	so I say, “Gone is my glory,
LAM.3.18	and my expectation from the 
LAM.3.19	Remember my affliction and my bitterness,
LAM.3.19	the wormwood and the gall!
LAM.3.20	My soul continually thinks of it
LAM.3.20	and is bowed down within me.
LAM.3.21	But this I call to mind,
LAM.3.21	and therefore I have hope:
LAM.3.22	The steadfast love of the 
LAM.3.22	his mercies never come to an end;
LAM.3.23	they are new every morning;
LAM.3.23	great is thy faithfulness.
LAM.3.24	“The 
LAM.3.24	“therefore I will hope in him.”
LAM.3.25	The 
LAM.3.25	to the soul that seeks him.
LAM.3.26	It is good that one should wait quietly
LAM.3.26	for the salvation of the 
LAM.3.27	It is good for a man that he bear
LAM.3.27	the yoke in his youth.
LAM.3.28	Let him sit alone in silence
LAM.3.28	when he has laid it on him;
LAM.3.29	let him put his mouth in the dust—
LAM.3.29	there may yet be hope;
LAM.3.30	let him give his cheek to the smiter,
LAM.3.30	and be filled with insults.
LAM.3.31	For the Lord will not
LAM.3.31	cast off for ever,
LAM.3.32	but, though he cause grief, he will have compassion
LAM.3.32	according to the abundance of his steadfast love;
LAM.3.33	for he does not willingly afflict
LAM.3.33	or grieve the sons of men.
LAM.3.34	To crush under foot
LAM.3.34	all the prisoners of the earth,
LAM.3.35	to turn aside the right of a man
LAM.3.35	in the presence of the Most High,
LAM.3.36	to subvert a man in his cause,
LAM.3.36	the Lord does not approve.
LAM.3.37	Who has commanded and it came to pass,
LAM.3.37	unless the Lord has ordained it?
LAM.3.38	Is it not from the mouth of the Most High
LAM.3.38	that good and evil come?
LAM.3.39	Why should a living man complain,
LAM.3.39	a man, about the punishment of his sins?
LAM.3.40	Let us test and examine our ways,
LAM.3.40	and return to the 
LAM.3.41	Let us lift up our hearts and hands
LAM.3.41	to God in heaven:
LAM.3.42	“We have transgressed and rebelled,
LAM.3.42	and thou hast not forgiven.
LAM.3.43	“Thou hast wrapped thyself with anger and pursued us,
LAM.3.43	slaying without pity;
LAM.3.44	thou hast wrapped thyself with a cloud
LAM.3.44	so that no prayer can pass through.
LAM.3.45	Thou hast made us offscouring and refuse
LAM.3.45	among the peoples.
LAM.3.46	“All our enemies
LAM.3.46	rail against us;
LAM.3.47	panic and pitfall have come upon us,
LAM.3.47	devastation and destruction;
LAM.3.48	my eyes flow with rivers of tears
LAM.3.48	because of the destruction of the daughter of my people.
LAM.3.49	“My eyes will flow without ceasing,
LAM.3.49	without respite,
LAM.3.50	until the 
LAM.3.50	looks down and sees;
LAM.3.51	my eyes cause me grief
LAM.3.51	at the fate of all the maidens of my city.
LAM.3.52	“I have been hunted like a bird
LAM.3.52	by those who were my enemies without cause;
LAM.3.53	they flung me alive into the pit
LAM.3.53	and cast stones on me;
LAM.3.54	water closed over my head;
LAM.3.54	I said, ‘I am lost.’
LAM.3.55	“I called on thy name, O 
LAM.3.55	from the depths of the pit;
LAM.3.56	thou didst hear my plea, ‘Do not close
LAM.3.56	thine ear to my cry for help!’
LAM.3.57	Thou didst come near when I called on thee;
LAM.3.57	thou didst say, ‘Do not fear!’
LAM.3.58	“Thou hast taken up my cause, O Lord,
LAM.3.58	thou hast redeemed my life.
LAM.3.59	Thou hast seen the wrong done to me, O 
LAM.3.59	judge thou my cause.
LAM.3.60	Thou hast seen all their vengeance, all their devices against me.
LAM.3.61	“Thou hast heard their taunts, O 
LAM.3.61	all their devices against me.
LAM.3.62	The lips and thoughts of my assailants
LAM.3.62	are against me all the day long.
LAM.3.63	Behold their sitting and their rising;
LAM.3.63	I am the burden of their songs.
LAM.3.64	“Thou wilt requite them, O 
LAM.3.64	according to the work of their hands.
LAM.3.65	Thou wilt give them dullness of heart;
LAM.3.65	thy curse will be on them.
LAM.3.66	Thou wilt pursue them in anger and destroy them
LAM.3.66	from under thy heavens, O 
LAM.4.1	How the gold has grown dim,
LAM.4.1	how the pure gold is changed!
LAM.4.1	The holy stones lie scattered
LAM.4.1	at the head of every street.
LAM.4.2	The precious sons of Zion,
LAM.4.2	worth their weight in fine gold,
LAM.4.2	how they are reckoned as earthen pots,
LAM.4.2	the work of a potter's hands!
LAM.4.3	Even the jackals give the breast
LAM.4.3	and suckle their young,
LAM.4.3	but the daughter of my people has become cruel,
LAM.4.3	like the ostriches in the wilderness.
LAM.4.4	The tongue of the nursling cleaves
LAM.4.4	to the roof of its mouth for thirst;
LAM.4.4	the children beg for food,
LAM.4.4	but no one gives to them.
LAM.4.5	Those who feasted on dainties
LAM.4.5	perish in the streets;
LAM.4.5	those who were brought up in purple
LAM.4.5	lie on ash heaps.
LAM.4.6	For the chastisement
LAM.4.6	than the punishment
LAM.4.6	which was overthrown in a moment,
LAM.4.6	no hand being laid on it.
LAM.4.7	Her princes were purer than snow,
LAM.4.7	whiter than milk;
LAM.4.7	their bodies were more ruddy than coral,
LAM.4.7	the beauty of their form
LAM.4.8	Now their visage is blacker than soot,
LAM.4.8	they are not recognized in the streets;
LAM.4.8	their skin has shriveled upon their bones,
LAM.4.8	it has become as dry as wood.
LAM.4.9	Happier were the victims of the sword
LAM.4.9	than the victims of hunger,
LAM.4.9	who pined away, stricken
LAM.4.9	by want of the fruits of the field.
LAM.4.10	The hands of compassionate women
LAM.4.10	have boiled their own children;
LAM.4.10	they became their food
LAM.4.10	in the destruction of the daughter of my people.
LAM.4.11	The 
LAM.4.11	he poured out his hot anger;
LAM.4.11	and he kindled a fire in Zion,
LAM.4.11	which consumed its foundations.
LAM.4.12	The kings of the earth did not believe,
LAM.4.12	or any of the inhabitants of the world,
LAM.4.12	that foe or enemy could enter
LAM.4.12	the gates of Jerusalem.
LAM.4.13	This was for the sins of her prophets
LAM.4.13	and the iniquities of her priests,
LAM.4.13	who shed in the midst of her
LAM.4.13	the blood of the righteous.
LAM.4.14	They wandered, blind, through the streets,
LAM.4.14	so defiled with blood
LAM.4.14	that none could touch
LAM.4.14	their garments.
LAM.4.15	“Away! Unclean!” men cried at them;
LAM.4.15	“Away! Away! Touch not!”
LAM.4.15	So they became fugitives and wanderers;
LAM.4.15	men said among the nations,
LAM.4.15	“They shall stay with us no longer.”
LAM.4.16	The 
LAM.4.16	he will regard them no more;
LAM.4.16	no honor was shown to the priests,
LAM.4.16	no favor to the elders.
LAM.4.17	Our eyes failed, ever watching
LAM.4.17	vainly for help;
LAM.4.17	in our watching
LAM.4.17	for a nation which could not save.
LAM.4.18	Men dogged our steps
LAM.4.18	so that we could not walk in our streets;
LAM.4.18	our end drew near; our days were numbered;
LAM.4.18	for our end had come.
LAM.4.19	Our pursuers were swifter
LAM.4.19	than the vultures in the heavens;
LAM.4.19	they chased us on the mountains,
LAM.4.19	they lay in wait for us in the wilderness.
LAM.4.20	The breath of our nostrils, the 
LAM.4.20	was taken in their pits,
LAM.4.20	he of whom we said, “Under his shadow
LAM.4.20	we shall live among the nations.”
LAM.4.21	Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom,
LAM.4.21	dweller in the land of Uz;
LAM.4.21	but to you also the cup shall pass;
LAM.4.21	you shall become drunk and strip yourself bare.
LAM.4.22	The punishment of your iniquity, O daughter of Zion, is accomplished,
LAM.4.22	he will keep you in exile no longer;
LAM.4.22	but your iniquity, O daughter of Edom, he will punish,
LAM.4.22	he will uncover your sins.
LAM.5.1	Remember, O 
LAM.5.1	behold, and see our disgrace!
LAM.5.2	Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers,
LAM.5.2	our homes to aliens.
LAM.5.3	We have become orphans, fatherless;
LAM.5.3	our mothers are like widows.
LAM.5.4	We must pay for the water we drink,
LAM.5.4	the wood we get must be bought.
LAM.5.5	With a yoke
LAM.5.5	we are weary, we are given no rest.
LAM.5.6	We have given the hand to Egypt,
LAM.5.6	and to Assyria, to get bread enough.
LAM.5.7	Our fathers sinned, and are no more;
LAM.5.7	and we bear their iniquities.
LAM.5.8	Slaves rule over us;
LAM.5.8	there is none to deliver us from their hand.
LAM.5.9	We get our bread at the peril of our lives,
LAM.5.9	because of the sword in the wilderness.
LAM.5.10	Our skin is hot as an oven
LAM.5.10	with the burning heat of famine.
LAM.5.11	Women are ravished in Zion,
LAM.5.11	virgins in the towns of Judah.
LAM.5.12	Princes are hung up by their hands;
LAM.5.12	no respect is shown to the elders.
LAM.5.13	Young men are compelled to grind at the mill;
LAM.5.13	and boys stagger under loads of wood.
LAM.5.14	The old men have quit the city gate,
LAM.5.14	the young men their music.
LAM.5.15	The joy of our hearts has ceased;
LAM.5.15	our dancing has been turned to mourning.
LAM.5.16	The crown has fallen from our head;
LAM.5.16	woe to us, for we have sinned!
LAM.5.17	For this our heart has become sick,
LAM.5.17	for these things our eyes have grown dim,
LAM.5.18	for Mount Zion which lies desolate;
LAM.5.18	jackals prowl over it.
LAM.5.19	But thou, O 
LAM.5.19	thy throne endures to all generations.
LAM.5.20	Why dost thou forget us for ever,
LAM.5.20	why dost thou so long forsake us?
LAM.5.21	Restore us to thyself, O 
LAM.5.21	Renew our days as of old!
LAM.5.22	Or hast thou utterly rejected us?
LAM.5.22	Art thou exceedingly angry with us?
EZK.1.2	On the fifth day of the month (it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin), 
EZK.1.3	the word of the 
EZK.1.4	As I looked, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, and a great cloud, with brightness round about it, and fire flashing forth continually, and in the midst of the fire, as it were gleaming bronze. 
EZK.1.5	 And from the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the form of men, 
EZK.1.6	but each had four faces, and each of them had four wings. 
EZK.1.7	Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled like burnished bronze. 
EZK.1.8	Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. And the four had their faces and their wings thus: 
EZK.1.9	their wings touched one another; they went every one straight forward, without turning as they went. 
EZK.1.10	 As for the likeness of their faces, each had the face of a man in front;
EZK.1.11	Such were their faces. And their wings were spread out above; each creature had two wings, each of which touched the wing of another, while two covered their bodies. 
EZK.1.12	And each went straight forward; wherever the spirit would go, they went, without turning as they went. 
EZK.1.13	 In the midst of
EZK.1.14	And the living creatures darted to and fro, like a flash of lightning.
EZK.1.15	Now as I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures, one for each of the four of them.
EZK.1.16	As for the appearance of the wheels and their construction: their appearance was like the gleaming of a chrysolite; and the four had the same likeness, their construction being as it were a wheel within a wheel. 
EZK.1.17	When they went, they went in any of their four directions
EZK.1.18	 The four wheels had rims and they had spokes;
EZK.1.19	And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose. 
EZK.1.20	Wherever the spirit would go, they went, and the wheels rose along with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. 
EZK.1.21	When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those rose from the earth, the wheels rose along with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
EZK.1.22	Over the heads of the living creatures there was the likeness of a firmament, shining like crystal,
EZK.1.23	And under the firmament their wings were stretched out straight, one toward another; and each creature had two wings covering its body. 
EZK.1.24	 And when they went, I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of many waters, like the thunder of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of a host; when they stood still, they let down their wings. 
EZK.1.25	And there came a voice from above the firmament over their heads; when they stood still, they let down their wings.
EZK.1.27	And upward from what had the appearance of his loins I saw as it were gleaming bronze, like the appearance of fire enclosed round about; and downward from what had the appearance of his loins I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him.
EZK.1.28	Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about.
EZK.1.28	Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the 
EZK.2.1	And he said to me, “Son of man, stand upon your feet, and I will speak with you.” 
EZK.2.2	And when he spoke to me, the Spirit entered into me and set me upon my feet; and I heard him speaking to me. 
EZK.2.3	And he said to me, “Son of man, I send you to the people of Israel, to a nation
EZK.2.4	The people also are impudent and stubborn: I send you to them; and you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord 
EZK.2.5	And whether they hear or refuse to hear (for they are a rebellious house) they will know that there has been a prophet among them. 
EZK.2.6	And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you and you sit upon scorpions; be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house. 
EZK.2.7	And you shall speak my words to them, whether they hear or refuse to hear; for they are a rebellious house.
EZK.2.9	And when I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me, and lo, a written scroll was in it; 
EZK.2.10	and he spread it before me; and it had writing on the front and on the back, and there were written on it words of lamentation and mourning and woe.
EZK.3.1	And he said to me, “Son of man, eat what is offered to you; eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.” 
EZK.3.2	So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat. 
EZK.3.3	And he said to me, “Son of man, eat this scroll that I give you and fill your stomach with it.” Then I ate it; and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey.
EZK.3.4	And he said to me, “Son of man, go, get you to the house of Israel, and speak with my words to them. 
EZK.3.5	For you are not sent to a people of foreign speech and a hard language, but to the house of Israel— 
EZK.3.6	not to many peoples of foreign speech and a hard language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, if I sent you to such, they would listen to you. 
EZK.3.7	But the house of Israel will not listen to you; for they are not willing to listen to me; because all the house of Israel are of a hard forehead and of a stubborn heart. 
EZK.3.8	Behold, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your forehead hard against their foreheads. 
EZK.3.9	Like adamant harder than flint have I made your forehead; fear them not, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.” 
EZK.3.10	Moreover he said to me, “Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears. 
EZK.3.11	And go, get you to the exiles, to your people, and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord 
EZK.3.12	Then the Spirit lifted me up, and as the glory of the 
EZK.3.13	it was the sound of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them, that sounded like a great earthquake. 
EZK.3.14	The Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit, the hand of the 
EZK.3.15	and I came to the exiles at Tel-abib, who dwelt by the river Chebar.
EZK.3.17	“Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me. 
EZK.3.18	If I say to the wicked, ‘You shall surely die,’ and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, in order to save his life, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand. 
EZK.3.19	But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, or from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you will have saved your life. 
EZK.3.20	Again, if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die; because you have not warned him, he shall die for his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand. 
EZK.3.21	Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man not to sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and you will have saved your life.”
EZK.3.22	And the hand of the 
EZK.3.23	So I arose and went forth into the plain;
EZK.3.24	But the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spoke with me and said to me, “Go, shut yourself within your house. 
EZK.3.25	And you, O son of man, behold, cords will be placed upon you, and you shall be bound with them, so that you cannot go out among the people; 
EZK.3.26	and I will make your tongue cleave to the roof of your mouth, so that you shall be dumb and unable to reprove them; for they are a rebellious house. 
EZK.3.27	But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord 
EZK.4.1	“And you, O son of man, take a brick and lay it before you, and portray upon it a city, even Jerusalem; 
EZK.4.2	and put siegeworks against it, and build a siege wall against it, and cast up a mound against it; set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it round about. 
EZK.4.3	And take an iron plate, and place it as an iron wall between you and the city; and set your face toward it, and let it be in a state of siege, and press the siege against it. This is a sign for the house of Israel.
EZK.4.4	“Then lie upon your left side, and I will lay the punishment of the house of Israel upon you;
EZK.4.5	For I assign to you a number of days, three hundred and ninety days, equal to the number of the years of their punishment; so long shall you bear the punishment of the house of Israel. 
EZK.4.6	And when you have completed these, you shall lie down a second time, but on your right side, and bear the punishment of the house of Judah; forty days I assign you, a day for each year. 
EZK.4.7	And you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm bared; and you shall prophesy against the city. 
EZK.4.8	And behold, I will put cords upon you, so that you cannot turn from one side to the other, till you have completed the days of your siege.
EZK.4.9	“And you, take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and spelt, and put them into a single vessel, and make bread of them. During the number of days that you lie upon your side, three hundred and ninety days, you shall eat it. 
EZK.4.10	And the food which you eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day; once a day you shall eat it. 
EZK.4.11	And water you shall drink by measure, the sixth part of a hin; once a day you shall drink. 
EZK.4.12	And you shall eat it as a barley cake, baking it in their sight on human dung.” 
EZK.4.13	And the 
EZK.4.14	Then I said, “Ah Lord 
EZK.4.15	Then he said to me, “See, I will let you have cow's dung instead of human dung, on which you may prepare your bread.” 
EZK.4.16	Moreover he said to me, “Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem; they shall eat bread by weight and with fearfulness; and they shall drink water by measure and in dismay. 
EZK.4.17	I will do this that they may lack bread and water, and look at one another in dismay, and waste away under their punishment.
EZK.5.1	“And you, O son of man, take a sharp sword; use it as a barber's razor and pass it over your head and your beard; then take balances for weighing, and divide the hair. 
EZK.5.2	A third part you shall burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are completed; and a third part you shall take and strike with the sword round about the city; and a third part you shall scatter to the wind, and I will unsheathe the sword after them. 
EZK.5.3	And you shall take from these a small number, and bind them in the skirts of your robe. 
EZK.5.4	And of these again you shall take some, and cast them into the fire, and burn them in the fire; from there a fire will come forth into all the house of Israel. 
EZK.5.5	Thus says the Lord 
EZK.5.6	And she has wickedly rebelled against my ordinances
EZK.5.7	Therefore thus says the Lord 
EZK.5.8	therefore thus says the Lord 
EZK.5.9	And because of all your abominations I will do with you what I have never yet done, and the like of which I will never do again. 
EZK.5.10	Therefore fathers shall eat their sons in the midst of you, and sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments on you, and any of you who survive I will scatter to all the winds. 
EZK.5.11	Wherefore, as I live, says the Lord 
EZK.5.12	A third part of you shall die of pestilence and be consumed with famine in the midst of you; a third part shall fall by the sword round about you; and a third part I will scatter to all the winds and will unsheathe the sword after them.
EZK.5.13	“Thus shall my anger spend itself, and I will vent my fury upon them and satisfy myself; and they shall know that I, the 
EZK.5.14	Moreover I will make you a desolation and an object of reproach among the nations round about you and in the sight of all that pass by. 
EZK.5.15	You shall be
EZK.5.16	when I loose against you
EZK.5.17	I will send famine and wild beasts against you, and they will rob you of your children; pestilence and blood shall pass through you; and I will bring the sword upon you. I, the 
EZK.6.1	The word of the 
EZK.6.2	“Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them, 
EZK.6.3	and say, You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord 
EZK.6.4	Your altars shall become desolate, and your incense altars shall be broken; and I will cast down your slain before your idols. 
EZK.6.5	And I will lay the dead bodies of the people of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars. 
EZK.6.6	Wherever you dwell your cities shall be waste and your high places ruined, so that your altars will be waste and ruined,
EZK.6.7	And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and you shall know that I am the

EZK.6.9	 then those of you who escape will remember me among the nations where they are carried captive, when I have broken

EZK.6.11	Thus says the Lord 
EZK.6.12	He that is far off shall die of pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that is left and is preserved shall die of famine. Thus I will spend my fury upon them. 
EZK.6.13	And you shall know that I am the 
EZK.6.14	And I will stretch out my hand against them, and make the land desolate and waste, throughout all their habitations, from the wilderness to Riblah.
EZK.7.1	The word of the 
EZK.7.2	 “And you, O son of man, thus says the Lord 
EZK.7.3	Now the end is upon you, and I will let loose my anger upon you, and will judge you according to your ways; and I will punish you for all your abominations. 
EZK.7.4	And my eye will not spare you, nor will I have pity; but I will punish you for your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that I am the

EZK.7.6	An end has come, the end has come; it has awakened against you. Behold, it comes. 
EZK.7.7	Your doom
EZK.7.8	Now I will soon pour out my wrath upon you, and spend my anger against you, and judge you according to your ways; and I will punish you for all your abominations. 
EZK.7.9	And my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity; I will punish you according to your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that I am the

EZK.7.11	Violence has grown up into a rod of wickedness; none of them shall remain, nor their abundance, nor their wealth; neither shall there be pre-eminence among them.
EZK.7.12	The time has come, the day draws near. Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn, for wrath is upon all their multitude. 
EZK.7.13	For the seller shall not return to what he has sold, while they live. For wrath

EZK.7.16	And if any survivors escape, they will be on the mountains, like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, every one over his iniquity. 
EZK.7.17	All hands are feeble, and all knees weak as water. 
EZK.7.18	They gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror covers them; shame is upon all faces, and baldness on all their heads. 
EZK.7.19	They cast their silver into the streets, and their gold is like an unclean thing; their silver and gold are not able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the 
EZK.7.20	Their

EZK.7.22	I will turn my face from them, that they may profane my precious
EZK.7.23	and make a desolation.
EZK.7.23	“Because the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence, 
EZK.7.24	I will bring the worst of the nations to take possession of their houses; I will put an end to their proud might, and their holy places shall be profaned. 
EZK.7.25	When anguish comes, they will seek peace, but there shall be none. 
EZK.7.26	Disaster comes upon disaster, rumor follows rumor; they seek a vision from the prophet, but the law perishes from the priest, and counsel from the elders. 
EZK.7.27	The king mourns, the prince is wrapped in despair, and the hands of the people of the land are palsied by terror. According to their way I will do to them, and according to their own judgments I will judge them; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.8.1	In the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, with the elders of Judah sitting before me, the hand of the Lord 
EZK.8.2	Then I beheld, and lo, a form that had the appearance of a man;
EZK.8.3	He put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the gateway of the inner court that faces north, where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy. 
EZK.8.4	And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw in the plain.
EZK.8.5	Then he said to me, “Son of man, lift up your eyes now in the direction of the north.” So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, north of the altar gate, in the entrance, was this image of jealousy. 
EZK.8.6	And he said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel are committing here, to drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see still greater abominations.”
EZK.8.7	And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, there was a hole in the wall. 
EZK.8.8	Then said he to me, “Son of man, dig in the wall”; and when I dug in the wall, lo, there was a door. 
EZK.8.9	And he said to me, “Go in, and see the vile abominations that they are committing here.” 
EZK.8.10	So I went in and saw; and there, portrayed upon the wall round about, were all kinds of creeping things, and loathsome beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel. 
EZK.8.11	And before them stood seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, with Ja-azaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them. Each had his censer in his hand, and the smoke of the cloud of incense went up. 
EZK.8.12	Then he said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark, every man in his room
EZK.8.13	He said also to me, “You will see still greater abominations which they commit.”
EZK.8.14	Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the 
EZK.8.15	Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, O son of man? You will see still greater abominations than these.”
EZK.8.16	And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the 
EZK.8.17	Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it too slight a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they commit here, that they should fill the land with violence, and provoke me further to anger? Lo, they put the branch to their nose. 
EZK.8.18	Therefore I will deal in wrath; my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity; and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.”
EZK.9.1	Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, “Draw near, you executioners of the city, each with his destroying weapon in his hand.” 
EZK.9.2	And lo, six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, every man with his weapon for slaughter in his hand, and with them was a man clothed in linen, with a writing case at his side. And they went in and stood beside the bronze altar.
EZK.9.3	Now the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherubim on which it rested to the threshold of the house; and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writing case at his side. 
EZK.9.4	 And the 
EZK.9.5	And to the others he said in my hearing, “Pass through the city after him, and smite; your eye shall not spare, and you shall show no pity; 
EZK.9.6	slay old men outright, young men and maidens, little children and women, but touch no one upon whom is the mark. And begin at my sanctuary.” So they began with the elders who were before the house. 
EZK.9.7	Then he said to them, “Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go forth.” So they went forth, and smote in the city. 
EZK.9.8	And while they were smiting, and I was left alone, I fell upon my face, and cried, “Ah Lord 
EZK.9.9	Then he said to me, “The guilt of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great; the land is full of blood, and the city full of injustice; for they say, ‘The 
EZK.9.10	As for me, my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity, but I will requite their deeds upon their heads.”
EZK.9.11	And lo, the man clothed in linen, with the writing case at his side, brought back word, saying, “I have done as thou didst command me.”
EZK.10.2	 And he said to the man clothed in linen, “Go in among the whirling wheels underneath the cherubim; fill your hands with burning coals from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.”
EZK.10.2	And he went in before my eyes. 
EZK.10.3	Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the house, when the man went in; and a cloud filled the inner court. 
EZK.10.4	And the glory of the 
EZK.10.5	And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.
EZK.10.6	And when he commanded the man clothed in linen, “Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim,” he went in and stood beside a wheel. 
EZK.10.7	And a cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took some of it, and put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who took it and went out. 
EZK.10.8	The cherubim appeared to have the form of a human hand under their wings.
EZK.10.9	And I looked, and behold, there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one beside each cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like sparkling chrysolite. 
EZK.10.10	And as for their appearance, the four had the same likeness, as if a wheel were within a wheel. 
EZK.10.11	When they went, they went in any of their four directions
EZK.10.12	 And
EZK.10.13	As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing the whirling wheels. 
EZK.10.14	 And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
EZK.10.15	And the cherubim mounted up. These were the living creatures that I saw by the river Chebar. 
EZK.10.16	And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels did not turn from beside them. 
EZK.10.17	When they stood still, these stood still, and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them; for the spirit of the living creatures
EZK.10.18	Then the glory of the 
EZK.10.19	And the cherubim lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight as they went forth, with the wheels beside them; and they stood at the door of the east gate of the house of the 
EZK.10.20	These were the living creatures that I saw underneath the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim. 
EZK.10.21	Each had four faces, and each four wings, and underneath their wings the semblance of human hands. 
EZK.10.22	And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the very faces whose appearance I had seen by the river Chebar. They went every one straight forward.
EZK.11.1	The Spirit lifted me up, and brought me to the east gate of the house of the 
EZK.11.2	And he said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity and who give wicked counsel in this city; 
EZK.11.3	who say, ‘The time is not near
EZK.11.4	Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.”
EZK.11.5	And the Spirit of the 
EZK.11.6	You have multiplied your slain in this city, and have filled its streets with the slain. 
EZK.11.7	Therefore thus says the Lord 
EZK.11.8	You have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword upon you, says the Lord 
EZK.11.9	And I will bring you forth out of the midst of it, and give you into the hands of foreigners, and execute judgments upon you. 
EZK.11.10	You shall fall by the sword; I will judge you at the border of Israel; and you shall know that I am the 
EZK.11.11	This city shall not be your caldron, nor shall you be the flesh in the midst of it; I will judge you at the border of Israel; 
EZK.11.12	and you shall know that I am the 
EZK.11.13	And it came to pass, while I was prophesying, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, “Ah Lord 
EZK.11.14	And the word of the 
EZK.11.15	“Son of man, your brethren, even your brethren, your fellow exiles,
EZK.11.16	Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord 
EZK.11.17	Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord 
EZK.11.18	And when they come there, they will remove from it all its detestable things and all its abominations. 
EZK.11.19	 And I will give them one
EZK.11.20	that they may walk in my statutes and keep my ordinances and obey them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. 
EZK.11.21	But as for those
EZK.11.22	Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them. 
EZK.11.23	And the glory of the 
EZK.11.24	And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to the exiles. Then the vision that I had seen went up from me. 
EZK.11.25	And I told the exiles all the things that the 
EZK.12.1	The word of the 
EZK.12.2	 “Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a rebellious house, who have eyes to see, but see not, who have ears to hear, but hear not; 
EZK.12.3	for they are a rebellious house. Therefore, son of man, prepare for yourself an exile's baggage, and go into exile by day in their sight; you shall go like an exile from your place to another place in their sight. Perhaps they will understand, though
EZK.12.4	You shall bring out your baggage by day in their sight, as baggage for exile; and you shall go forth yourself at evening in their sight, as men do who must go into exile. 
EZK.12.5	Dig through the wall in their sight, and go
EZK.12.6	In their sight you shall lift the baggage upon your shoulder, and carry it out in the dark; you shall cover your face, that you may not see the land; for I have made you a sign for the house of Israel.”
EZK.12.7	And I did as I was commanded. I brought out my baggage by day, as baggage for exile, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my own hands; I went forth in the dark, carrying my outfit upon my shoulder in their sight.
EZK.12.8	In the morning the word of the 
EZK.12.9	“Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, ‘What are you doing?’ 
EZK.12.10	Say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord 
EZK.12.11	Say, ‘I am a sign for you: as I have done, so shall it be done to them; they shall go into exile, into captivity.’ 
EZK.12.12	And the prince who is among them shall lift his baggage upon his shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth; he
EZK.12.13	And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare; and I will bring him to Babylon in the land of the Chaldeans, yet he shall not see it; and he shall die there. 
EZK.12.14	And I will scatter toward every wind all who are round about him, his helpers
EZK.12.15	And they shall know that I am the 
EZK.12.16	But I will let a few of them escape from the sword, from famine and pestilence, that they may confess all their abominations among the nations where they go, and may know that I am the 
EZK.12.17	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.12.18	“Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink water with trembling and with fearfulness; 
EZK.12.19	and say of the people of the land, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.12.20	And the inhabited cities shall be laid waste, and the land shall become a desolation; and you shall know that I am the 
EZK.12.21	And the word of the 
EZK.12.22	“Son of man, what is this proverb that you have about the land of Israel, saying, ‘The days grow long, and every vision comes to naught’? 
EZK.12.23	Tell them therefore, ‘Thus says the Lord 
EZK.12.24	For there shall be no more any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel. 
EZK.12.25	But I the 
EZK.12.26	Again the word of the 
EZK.12.27	“Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, ‘The vision that he sees is for many days hence, and he prophesies of times far off.’ 
EZK.12.28	Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.13.1	The word of the 
EZK.13.2	“Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel, prophesy
EZK.13.3	Thus says the Lord 
EZK.13.4	Your prophets have been like foxes among ruins, O Israel. 
EZK.13.5	You have not gone up into the breaches, or built up a wall for the house of Israel, that it might stand in battle in the day of the 
EZK.13.6	They have spoken falsehood and divined a lie; they say, ‘Says the 
EZK.13.7	Have you not seen a delusive vision, and uttered a lying divination, whenever you have said, ‘Says the 
EZK.13.8	Therefore thus says the Lord 
EZK.13.9	My hand will be against the prophets who see delusive visions and who give lying divinations; they shall not be in the council of my people, nor be enrolled in the register of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter the land of Israel; and you shall know that I am the Lord 
EZK.13.10	Because, yea, because they have misled my people, saying, ‘Peace,’ when there is no peace; and because, when the people build a wall, these prophets daub it with whitewash; 
EZK.13.11	say to those who daub it with whitewash that it shall fall! There will be a deluge of rain,
EZK.13.12	and when the wall falls, will it not be said to you, ‘Where is the daubing with which you daubed it?’ 
EZK.13.13	Therefore thus says the Lord 
EZK.13.14	And I will break down the wall that you have daubed with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be laid bare; when it falls, you shall perish in the midst of it; and you shall know that I am the 
EZK.13.15	Thus will I spend my wrath upon the wall, and upon those who have daubed it with whitewash; and I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor those who daubed it, 
EZK.13.16	the prophets of Israel who prophesied concerning Jerusalem and saw visions of peace for her, when there was no peace, says the Lord 
EZK.13.17	“And you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own minds; prophesy against them 
EZK.13.18	and say, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.13.19	You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, putting to death persons who should not die and keeping alive persons who should not live, by your lies to my people, who listen to lies.
EZK.13.20	“Wherefore thus says the Lord 
EZK.13.21	Your veils also I will tear off, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand as prey; and you shall know that I am the 
EZK.13.22	Because you have disheartened the righteous falsely, although I have not disheartened him, and you have encouraged the wicked, that he should not turn from his wicked way to save his life; 
EZK.13.23	therefore you shall no more see delusive visions nor practice divination; I will deliver my people out of your hand. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.14.1	Then came certain of the elders of Israel to me, and sat before me. 
EZK.14.2	And the word of the 
EZK.14.3	“Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their hearts, and set the stumbling block of their iniquity before their faces; should I let myself be inquired of at all by them? 
EZK.14.4	Therefore speak to them, and say to them, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.14.5	that I may lay hold of the hearts of the house of Israel, who are all estranged from me through their idols.
EZK.14.6	“Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.14.7	For any one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, who separates himself from me, taking his idols into his heart and putting the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and yet comes to a prophet to inquire for himself of me, I the 
EZK.14.8	and I will set my face against that man, I will make him a sign and a byword and cut him off from the midst of my people; and you shall know that I am the 
EZK.14.9	And if the prophet be deceived and speak a word, I, the 
EZK.14.10	And they shall bear their punishment—the punishment of the prophet and the punishment of the inquirer shall be alike— 
EZK.14.11	that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, nor defile themselves any more with all their transgressions, but that they may be my people and I may be their God, says the Lord 
EZK.14.12	And the word of the 
EZK.14.13	“Son of man, when a land sins against me by acting faithlessly, and I stretch out my hand against it, and break its staff of bread and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast, 
EZK.14.14	even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver but their own lives by their righteousness, says the Lord 
EZK.14.15	If I cause wild beasts to pass through the land, and they ravage it, and it be made desolate, so that no man may pass through because of the beasts; 
EZK.14.16	even if these three men were in it, as I live, says the Lord 
EZK.14.17	Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Let a sword go through the land; and I cut off from it man and beast; 
EZK.14.18	though these three men were in it, as I live, says the Lord 
EZK.14.19	Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath upon it with blood, to cut off from it man and beast; 
EZK.14.20	even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, says the Lord 
EZK.14.22	Yet, if there should be left in it any survivors to lead out sons and daughters, when they come forth to you, and you see their ways and their doings, you will be consoled for the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, for all that I have brought upon it. 
EZK.14.23	They will console you, when you see their ways and their doings; and you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, says the Lord 
EZK.15.1	And the word of the 
EZK.15.2	“Son of man, how does the wood of the vine surpass any wood, the vine branch which is among the trees of the forest? 
EZK.15.3	Is wood taken from it to make anything? Do men take a peg from it to hang any vessel on? 
EZK.15.4	Lo, it is given to the fire for fuel; when the fire has consumed both ends of it, and the middle of it is charred, is it useful for anything? 
EZK.15.5	Behold, when it was whole, it was used for nothing; how much less, when the fire has consumed it and it is charred, can it ever be used for anything! 
EZK.15.6	Therefore thus says the Lord 
EZK.15.7	And I will set my face against them; though they escape from the fire, the fire shall yet consume them; and you will know that I am the 
EZK.15.8	And I will make the land desolate, because they have acted faithlessly, says the Lord 
EZK.16.1	Again the word of the 
EZK.16.2	“Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations, 
EZK.16.3	 and say, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.16.4	And as for your birth, on the day you were born your navel string was not cut, nor were you washed with water to cleanse you, nor rubbed with salt, nor swathed with bands. 
EZK.16.5	No eye pitied you, to do any of these things to you out of compassion for you; but you were cast out on the open field, for you were abhorred, on the day that you were born.
EZK.16.6	“And when I passed by you, and saw you weltering in your blood, I said to you in your blood, ‘Live, 
EZK.16.7	and grow up
EZK.16.8	“When I passed by you again and looked upon you, behold, you were at the age for love; and I spread my skirt over you, and covered your nakedness: yea, I plighted my troth to you and entered into a covenant with you, says the Lord 
EZK.16.9	Then I bathed you with water and washed off your blood from you, and anointed you with oil. 
EZK.16.10	I clothed you also with embroidered cloth and shod you with leather, I swathed you in fine linen and covered you with silk. 
EZK.16.11	And I decked you with ornaments, and put bracelets on your arms, and a chain on your neck. 
EZK.16.12	And I put a ring on your nose, and earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown upon your head. 
EZK.16.13	Thus you were decked with gold and silver; and your raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and embroidered cloth; you ate fine flour and honey and oil. You grew exceedingly beautiful, and came to regal estate. 
EZK.16.14	And your renown went forth among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect through the splendor which I had bestowed upon you, says the Lord 
EZK.16.15	“But you trusted in your beauty, and played the harlot because of your renown, and lavished your harlotries on any passer-by. 
EZK.16.16	You took some of your garments, and made for yourself gaily decked shrines, and on them played the harlot; the like has never been, nor ever shall be. 
EZK.16.17	You also took your fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself images of men, and with them played the harlot; 
EZK.16.18	and you took your embroidered garments to cover them, and set my oil and my incense before them. 
EZK.16.19	Also my bread which I gave you—I fed you with fine flour and oil and honey—you set before them for a pleasing odor, says the Lord 
EZK.16.20	And you took your sons and your daughters, whom you had borne to me, and these you sacrificed to them to be devoured. Were your harlotries so small a matter 
EZK.16.21	that you slaughtered my children and delivered them up as an offering by fire to them? 
EZK.16.22	And in all your abominations and your harlotries you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, weltering in your blood.
EZK.16.23	“And after all your wickedness (woe, woe to you! says the Lord 
EZK.16.24	you built yourself a vaulted chamber, and made yourself a lofty place in every square; 
EZK.16.25	at the head of every street you built your lofty place and prostituted your beauty, offering yourself to any passer-by, and multiplying your harlotry. 
EZK.16.26	You also played the harlot with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, multiplying your harlotry, to provoke me to anger. 
EZK.16.27	Behold, therefore, I stretched out my hand against you, and diminished your allotted portion, and delivered you to the greed of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your lewd behavior. 
EZK.16.28	You played the harlot also with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; yea, you played the harlot with them, and still you were not satisfied. 
EZK.16.29	You multiplied your harlotry also with the trading land of Chaldea; and even with this you were not satisfied.
EZK.16.30	“How lovesick is your heart, says the Lord 
EZK.16.31	building your vaulted chamber at the head of every street, and making your lofty place in every square. Yet you were not like a harlot, because you scorned hire. 
EZK.16.32	Adulterous wife, who receives strangers instead of her husband! 
EZK.16.33	Men give gifts to all harlots; but you gave your gifts to all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from every side for your harlotries. 
EZK.16.34	So you were different from other women in your harlotries; none solicited you to play the harlot: and you gave hire, while no hire was given to you; therefore you were different.
EZK.16.35	“Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the 
EZK.16.36	Thus says the Lord 
EZK.16.37	therefore, behold, I will gather all your lovers, with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved and all those you loathed; I will gather them against you from every side, and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness. 
EZK.16.38	And I will judge you as women who break wedlock and shed blood are judged, and bring upon you the blood of wrath and jealousy. 
EZK.16.39	And I will give you into the hand of your lovers, and they shall throw down your vaulted chamber and break down your lofty places; they shall strip you of your clothes and take your fair jewels, and leave you naked and bare. 
EZK.16.40	They shall bring up a host against you, and they shall stone you and cut you to pieces with their swords. 
EZK.16.41	And they shall burn your houses and execute judgments upon you in the sight of many women; I will make you stop playing the harlot, and you shall also give hire no more. 
EZK.16.42	So will I satisfy my fury on you, and my jealousy shall depart from you; I will be calm, and will no more be angry. 
EZK.16.43	Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have enraged me with all these things; therefore, behold, I will requite your deeds upon your head, says the Lord 
EZK.16.43	“Have you not committed lewdness in addition to all your abominations? 
EZK.16.44	Behold, every one who uses proverbs will use this proverb about you, ‘Like mother, like daughter.’ 
EZK.16.45	 You are the daughter of your mother, who loathed her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite. 
EZK.16.46	And your elder sister is Samaria, who lived with her daughters to the north of you; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you, is Sodom with her daughters. 
EZK.16.47	Yet you were not content to walk in their ways, or do according to their abominations; within a very little time you were more corrupt than they in all your ways. 
EZK.16.48	As I live, says the Lord 
EZK.16.49	Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, surfeit of food, and prosperous ease, but did not aid the poor and needy. 
EZK.16.50	They were haughty, and did abominable things before me; therefore I removed them, when I saw it. 
EZK.16.51	Samaria has not committed half your sins; you have committed more abominations than they, and have made your sisters appear righteous by all the abominations which you have committed. 
EZK.16.52	Bear your disgrace, you also, for you have made judgment favorable to your sisters; because of your sins in which you acted more abominably than they, they are more in the right than you. So be ashamed, you also, and bear your disgrace, for you have made your sisters appear righteous.
EZK.16.53	“I will restore their fortunes, both the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters, and I will restore your own fortunes in the midst of them, 
EZK.16.54	that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all that you have done, becoming a consolation to them. 
EZK.16.55	As for your sisters, Sodom and her daughters shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate; and you and your daughters shall return to your former estate. 
EZK.16.56	Was not your sister Sodom a byword in your mouth in the day of your pride, 
EZK.16.57	before your wickedness was uncovered? Now you have become like her
EZK.16.58	You bear the penalty of your lewdness and your abominations, says the 
EZK.16.59	“Yea, thus says the Lord 
EZK.16.60	yet I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish with you an everlasting covenant. 
EZK.16.61	Then you will remember your ways, and be ashamed when I
EZK.16.62	I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall know that I am the 
EZK.16.63	that you may remember and be confounded, and never open your mouth again because of your shame, when I forgive you all that you have done, says the Lord 
EZK.17.1	The word of the 
EZK.17.2	“Son of man, propound a riddle, and speak an allegory to the house of Israel; 
EZK.17.3	say, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.17.4	he broke off the topmost of its young twigs and carried it to a land of trade, and set it in a city of merchants. 
EZK.17.5	Then he took of the seed of the land and planted it in fertile soil; he placed it beside abundant waters. He set it like a willow twig, 
EZK.17.6	and it sprouted and became a low spreading vine, and its branches turned toward him, and its roots remained where it stood. So it became a vine, and brought forth branches and put forth foliage.
EZK.17.7	“But there was another great eagle with great wings and much plumage; and behold, this vine bent its roots toward him, and shot forth its branches toward him that he might water it. From the bed where it was planted 
EZK.17.8	he transplanted it
EZK.17.9	Say, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.17.10	Behold, when it is transplanted, will it thrive? Will it not utterly wither when the east wind strikes it—wither away on the bed where it grew?”
EZK.17.11	Then the word of the 
EZK.17.12	“Say now to the rebellious house, Do you not know what these things mean? Tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took her king and her princes and brought them to him to Babylon. 
EZK.17.13	And he took one of the seed royal and made a covenant with him, putting him under oath. (The chief men of the land he had taken away, 
EZK.17.14	that the kingdom might be humble and not lift itself up, and that by keeping his covenant it might stand.) 
EZK.17.15	But he rebelled against him by sending ambassadors to Egypt, that they might give him horses and a large army. Will he succeed? Can a man escape who does such things? Can he break the covenant and yet escape? 
EZK.17.16	As I live, says the Lord 
EZK.17.17	Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company will not help him in war, when mounds are cast up and siege walls built to cut off many lives. 
EZK.17.18	Because he despised the oath and broke the covenant, because he gave his hand and yet did all these things, he shall not escape. 
EZK.17.19	Therefore thus says the Lord 
EZK.17.20	I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon and enter into judgment with him there for the treason he has committed against me. 
EZK.17.21	And all the pick
EZK.17.22	Thus says the Lord 
EZK.17.23	 on the mountain height of Israel will I plant it, that it may bring forth boughs and bear fruit, and become a noble cedar; and under it will dwell all kinds of beasts;
EZK.17.24	And all the trees of the field shall know that I the 
EZK.18.1	The word of the 
EZK.18.2	 “What do you mean by repeating this proverb concerning the land of Israel, ‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge’? 
EZK.18.3	As I live, says the Lord 
EZK.18.4	 Behold, all souls are mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sins shall die.
EZK.18.5	“If a man is righteous and does what is lawful and right— 
EZK.18.6	if he does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor's wife or approach a woman in her time of impurity, 
EZK.18.7	does not oppress any one, but restores to the debtor his pledge, commits no robbery, gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment, 
EZK.18.8	does not lend at interest or take any increase, withholds his hand from iniquity, executes true justice between man and man, 
EZK.18.9	walks in my statutes, and is careful to observe my ordinances
EZK.18.10	“If he begets a son who is a robber, a shedder of blood,
EZK.18.11	who does none of these duties, but eats upon the mountains, defiles his neighbor's wife, 
EZK.18.12	oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not restore the pledge, lifts up his eyes to the idols, commits abomination, 
EZK.18.13	lends at interest, and takes increase; shall he then live? He shall not live. He has done all these abominable things; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon himself.
EZK.18.14	“But if this man begets a son who sees all the sins which his father has done, and fears, and does not do likewise, 
EZK.18.15	who does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor's wife, 
EZK.18.16	does not wrong any one, exacts no pledge, commits no robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment, 
EZK.18.17	withholds his hand from iniquity,
EZK.18.18	As for his father, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother, and did what is not good among his people, behold, he shall die for his iniquity.
EZK.18.19	“Yet you say, ‘Why should not the son suffer for the iniquity of the father?’ When the son has done what is lawful and right, and has been careful to observe all my statutes, he shall surely live. 
EZK.18.20	 The soul that sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself.
EZK.18.21	“But if a wicked man turns away from all his sins which he has committed and keeps all my statutes and does what is lawful and right, he shall surely live; he shall not die. 
EZK.18.22	None of the transgressions which he has committed shall be remembered against him; for the righteousness which he has done he shall live. 
EZK.18.23	 Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked, says the Lord 
EZK.18.24	But when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity and does the same abominable things that the wicked man does, shall he live? None of the righteous deeds which he has done shall be remembered; for the treachery of which he is guilty and the sin he has committed, he shall die.
EZK.18.25	“Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ Hear now, O house of Israel: Is my way not just? Is it not your ways that are not just? 
EZK.18.26	When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he shall die for it; for the iniquity which he has committed he shall die. 
EZK.18.27	Again, when a wicked man turns away from the wickedness he has committed and does what is lawful and right, he shall save his life. 
EZK.18.28	Because he considered and turned away from all the transgressions which he had committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die. 
EZK.18.29	Yet the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ O house of Israel, are my ways not just? Is it not your ways that are not just?
EZK.18.30	“Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, says the Lord 
EZK.18.31	 Cast away from you all the transgressions which you have committed against me, and get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! Why will you die, O house of Israel? 
EZK.18.32	 For I have no pleasure in the death of any one, says the Lord 
EZK.19.1	And you, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel, 
EZK.19.2	and say:
EZK.19.2	What a lioness was your mother
EZK.19.2	among lions!
EZK.19.2	She couched in the midst of young lions,
EZK.19.2	rearing her whelps.
EZK.19.3	And she brought up one of her whelps;
EZK.19.3	he became a young lion,
EZK.19.3	and he learned to catch prey;
EZK.19.3	he devoured men.
EZK.19.4	The nations sounded an alarm against him;
EZK.19.4	he was taken in their pit;
EZK.19.4	and they brought him with hooks
EZK.19.4	to the land of Egypt.
EZK.19.5	When she saw that she was baffled,
EZK.19.5	that her hope was lost,
EZK.19.5	she took another of her whelps
EZK.19.5	and made him a young lion.
EZK.19.6	He prowled among the lions;
EZK.19.6	he became a young lion,
EZK.19.6	and he learned to catch prey;
EZK.19.6	he devoured men.
EZK.19.7	And he ravaged their strongholds,
EZK.19.7	and laid waste their cities;
EZK.19.7	and the land was appalled and all who were in it
EZK.19.7	at the sound of his roaring.
EZK.19.8	Then the nations set against him
EZK.19.8	snares
EZK.19.8	they spread their net over him;
EZK.19.8	he was taken in their pit.
EZK.19.9	With hooks they put him in a cage,
EZK.19.9	and brought him to the king of Babylon;
EZK.19.9	they brought him into custody,
EZK.19.9	that his voice should no more be heard
EZK.19.9	upon the mountains of Israel.
EZK.19.10	Your mother was like a vine in a vineyard
EZK.19.10	transplanted by the water,
EZK.19.10	fruitful and full of branches
EZK.19.10	by reason of abundant water.
EZK.19.11	Its strongest stem became
EZK.19.11	a ruler's scepter;
EZK.19.11	it towered aloft
EZK.19.11	among the thick boughs;
EZK.19.11	it was seen in its height
EZK.19.11	with the mass of its branches.
EZK.19.12	But the vine was plucked up in fury,
EZK.19.12	cast down to the ground;
EZK.19.12	the east wind dried it up;
EZK.19.12	its fruit was stripped off,
EZK.19.12	its strong stem was withered;
EZK.19.12	the fire consumed it.
EZK.19.13	Now it is transplanted in the wilderness,
EZK.19.13	in a dry and thirsty land.
EZK.19.14	And fire has gone out from its stem,
EZK.19.14	has consumed its branches and fruit,
EZK.19.14	so that there remains in it no strong stem,
EZK.19.14	no scepter for a ruler.
EZK.19.14	This is a lamentation, and has become a lamentation.
EZK.20.1	In the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the 
EZK.20.2	And the word of the 
EZK.20.3	“Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.20.4	Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? Then let them know the abominations of their fathers, 
EZK.20.5	and say to them, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.20.6	On that day I swore to them that I would bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most glorious of all lands. 
EZK.20.7	And I said to them, Cast away the detestable things your eyes feast on, every one of you, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am the 
EZK.20.8	But they rebelled against me and would not listen to me; they did not every man cast away the detestable things their eyes feasted on, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt.
EZK.20.8	“Then I thought I would pour out my wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt. 
EZK.20.9	But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they dwelt, in whose sight I made myself known to them in bringing them out of the land of Egypt. 
EZK.20.10	So I led them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness. 
EZK.20.11	I gave them my statutes and showed them my ordinances, by whose observance man shall live. 
EZK.20.12	Moreover I gave them my sabbaths, as a sign between me and them, that they might know that I the 
EZK.20.13	But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness; they did not walk in my statutes but rejected my ordinances, by whose observance man shall live; and my sabbaths they greatly profaned.
EZK.20.13	“Then I thought I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to make a full end of them. 
EZK.20.14	But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out. 
EZK.20.15	Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most glorious of all lands, 
EZK.20.16	because they rejected my ordinances and did not walk in my statutes, and profaned my sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols. 
EZK.20.17	Nevertheless my eye spared them, and I did not destroy them or make a full end of them in the wilderness.
EZK.20.18	“And I said to their children in the wilderness, Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, nor observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols. 
EZK.20.19	I the 
EZK.20.20	and hallow my sabbaths that they may be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I the 
EZK.20.21	But the children rebelled against me; they did not walk in my statutes, and were not careful to observe my ordinances, by whose observance man shall live; they profaned my sabbaths.
EZK.20.21	“Then I thought I would pour out my wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the wilderness. 
EZK.20.22	But I withheld my hand, and acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out. 
EZK.20.23	Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the countries, 
EZK.20.24	because they had not executed my ordinances, but had rejected my statutes and profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes were set on their fathers' idols. 
EZK.20.25	Moreover I gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances by which they could not have life; 
EZK.20.26	and I defiled them through their very gifts in making them offer by fire all their first-born, that I might horrify them; I did it that they might know that I am the 
EZK.20.27	“Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.20.28	For when I had brought them into the land which I swore to give them, then wherever they saw any high hill or any leafy tree, there they offered their sacrifices and presented the provocation of their offering; there they sent up their soothing odors, and there they poured out their drink offerings. 
EZK.20.29	(I said to them, What is the high place to which you go? So its name is called Bamah
EZK.20.30	Wherefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.20.31	When you offer your gifts and sacrifice your sons by fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols to this day. And shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, says the Lord 
EZK.20.32	“What is in your mind shall never happen—the thought, ‘Let us be like the nations, like the tribes of the countries, and worship wood and stone.’
EZK.20.33	“As I live, says the Lord 
EZK.20.34	I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you are scattered, with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out; 
EZK.20.35	and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face. 
EZK.20.36	As I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you, says the Lord 
EZK.20.37	I will make you pass under the rod, and I will let you go in by number.
EZK.20.38	I will purge out the rebels from among you, and those who transgress against me; I will bring them out of the land where they sojourn, but they shall not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.20.39	“As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord 
EZK.20.40	“For on my holy mountain, the mountain height of Israel, says the Lord 
EZK.20.41	 As a pleasing odor I will accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries where you have been scattered; and I will manifest my holiness among you in the sight of the nations. 
EZK.20.42	And you shall know that I am the 
EZK.20.43	 And there you shall remember your ways and all the doings with which you have polluted yourselves; and you shall loathe yourselves for all the evils that you have committed. 
EZK.20.44	And you shall know that I am the

EZK.21.10	sharpened for slaughter,
EZK.21.10	polished to flash like lightning!
EZK.21.10	Or do we make mirth? You have despised the rod, my son, with everything of wood. 
EZK.21.11	So the sword is given to be polished, that it may be handled; it is sharpened and polished to be given into the hand of the slayer. 
EZK.21.12	Cry and wail, son of man, for it is against my people; it is against all the princes of Israel; they are delivered over to the sword with my people. Smite therefore upon your thigh. 
EZK.21.13	For it will not be a testing—what could it do if you despise the rod?” says the Lord 
EZK.21.14	“Prophesy therefore, son of man; clap your hands and let the sword come down twice, yea thrice, the sword for those to be slain; it is the sword for the great slaughter, which encompasses them, 
EZK.21.15	that their hearts may melt, and many fall at all their gates. I have given the glittering sword; ah! it is made like lightning, it is polished

EZK.21.20	mark a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the Ammonites and to Judah and to
EZK.21.21	For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination; he shakes the arrows, he consults the teraphim, he looks at the liver. 
EZK.21.22	Into his right hand comes the lot for Jerusalem,
EZK.21.23	But to them it will seem like a false divination; they have sworn solemn oaths; but he brings their guilt to remembrance, that they may be captured.

EZK.22.11	One commits abomination with his neighbor's wife; another lewdly defiles his daughter-in-law; another in you defiles his sister, his father's daughter.

EZK.22.30	And I sought for a man among them who should build up the wall and stand in the breach before me for the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found none. 
EZK.22.31	Therefore I have poured out my indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath; their way have I requited upon their heads, says the Lord 
EZK.23.1	The word of the 
EZK.23.2	“Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother; 
EZK.23.3	they played the harlot in Egypt; they played the harlot in their youth; there their breasts were pressed and their virgin bosoms handled. 
EZK.23.4	Oholah was the name of the elder and Oholibah the name of her sister. They became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem.
EZK.23.5	“Oholah played the harlot while she was mine; and she doted on her lovers the Assyrians, 
EZK.23.6	warriors clothed in purple, governors and commanders, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses. 
EZK.23.7	She bestowed her harlotries upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them; and she defiled herself with all the idols of every one on whom she doted. 
EZK.23.8	She did not give up her harlotry which she had practiced since her days in Egypt; for in her youth men had lain with her and handled her virgin bosom and poured out their lust upon her. 
EZK.23.9	Therefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted. 
EZK.23.10	These uncovered her nakedness; they seized her sons and her daughters; and her they slew with the sword; and she became a byword among women, when judgment had been executed upon her.
EZK.23.11	“Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more corrupt than she in her doting and in her harlotry, which was worse than that of her sister. 
EZK.23.12	She doted upon the Assyrians, governors and commanders, warriors clothed in full armor, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men. 
EZK.23.13	And I saw that she was defiled; they both took the same way. 
EZK.23.14	But she carried her harlotry further; she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed in vermilion, 
EZK.23.15	girded with belts on their loins, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like officers, a picture of Babylonians whose native land was Chaldea. 
EZK.23.16	When she saw them she doted upon them, and sent messengers to them in Chaldea. 
EZK.23.17	And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their lust; and after she was polluted by them, she turned from them in disgust. 
EZK.23.18	When she carried on her harlotry so openly and flaunted her nakedness, I turned in disgust from her, as I had turned from her sister. 
EZK.23.19	Yet she increased her harlotry, remembering the days of her youth, when she played the harlot in the land of Egypt 
EZK.23.20	and doted upon her paramours there, whose members were like those of asses, and whose issue was like that of horses. 
EZK.23.21	Thus you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians
EZK.23.22	Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the Lord 
EZK.23.23	the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, desirable young men, governors and commanders all of them, officers and warriors,
EZK.23.24	And they shall come against you from the north
EZK.23.25	And I will direct my indignation against you, that they may deal with you in fury. They shall cut off your nose and your ears, and your survivors shall fall by the sword. They shall seize your sons and your daughters, and your survivors shall be devoured by fire. 
EZK.23.26	They shall also strip you of your clothes and take away your fine jewels. 
EZK.23.27	Thus I will put an end to your lewdness and your harlotry brought from the land of Egypt; so that you shall not lift up your eyes to the Egyptians or remember them any more. 
EZK.23.28	For thus says the Lord 
EZK.23.29	and they shall deal with you in hatred, and take away all the fruit of your labor, and leave you naked and bare, and the nakedness of your harlotry shall be uncovered. Your lewdness and your harlotry 
EZK.23.30	have brought this upon you, because you played the harlot with the nations, and polluted yourself with their idols. 
EZK.23.31	You have gone the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand. 
EZK.23.32	Thus says the Lord 
EZK.23.32	“You shall drink your sister's cup
EZK.23.32	which is deep and large;
EZK.23.32	you shall be laughed at and held in derision,
EZK.23.32	for it contains much;
EZK.23.33	you will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow.
EZK.23.33	A cup of horror and desolation,
EZK.23.33	is the cup of your sister Samaria;
EZK.23.34	you shall drink it and drain it out,
EZK.23.34	and pluck out your hair,
EZK.23.34	and tear your breasts;
EZK.23.34	for I have spoken, says the Lord 
EZK.23.35	Therefore thus says the Lord 
EZK.23.36	The 
EZK.23.37	For they have committed adultery, and blood is upon their hands; with their idols they have committed adultery; and they have even offered up to them for food the sons whom they had borne to me. 
EZK.23.38	Moreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary on the same day and profaned my sabbaths. 
EZK.23.39	For when they had slaughtered their children in sacrifice to their idols, on the same day they came into my sanctuary to profane it. And lo, this is what they did in my house. 
EZK.23.40	They even sent for men to come from far, to whom a messenger was sent, and lo, they came. For them you bathed yourself, painted your eyes, and decked yourself with ornaments; 
EZK.23.41	you sat upon a stately couch, with a table spread before it on which you had placed my incense and my oil. 
EZK.23.42	The sound of a carefree multitude was with her; and with men of the common sort drunkards
EZK.23.43	“Then I said, Do not men now commit adultery
EZK.23.44	For they have gone in to her, as men go in to a harlot. Thus they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah to commit lewdness.
EZK.23.45	But righteous men shall pass judgment on them with the sentence of adulteresses, and with the sentence of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is upon their hands.”
EZK.23.46	For thus says the Lord 
EZK.23.47	And the host shall stone them and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses. 
EZK.23.48	Thus will I put an end to lewdness in the land, that all women may take warning and not commit lewdness as you have done. 
EZK.23.49	And your lewdness shall be requited upon you, and you shall bear the penalty for your sinful idolatry; and you shall know that I am the Lord 
EZK.24.1	In the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, the word of the 
EZK.24.2	“Son of man, write down the name of this day, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day. 
EZK.24.3	And utter an allegory to the rebellious house and say to them, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.24.3	Set on the pot, set it on,
EZK.24.3	pour in water also;
EZK.24.4	put in it the pieces of flesh,
EZK.24.4	all the good pieces, the thigh and the shoulder;
EZK.24.4	fill it with choice bones.
EZK.24.5	Take the choicest one of the flock,
EZK.24.5	pile the logs
EZK.24.5	boil its pieces,
EZK.24.5	seethe
EZK.24.6	“Therefore thus says the Lord 
EZK.24.7	For the blood she has shed is still in the midst of her; she put it on the bare rock, she did not pour it upon the ground to cover it with dust. 
EZK.24.8	To rouse my wrath, to take vengeance, I have set on the bare rock the blood she has shed, that it may not be covered. 
EZK.24.9	Therefore thus says the Lord 
EZK.24.10	Heap on the logs, kindle the fire, boil well the flesh, and empty out the broth,
EZK.24.11	Then set it empty upon the coals, that it may become hot, and its copper may burn, that its filthiness may be melted in it, its rust consumed. 
EZK.24.12	In vain I have wearied myself;
EZK.24.13	Its rust is your filthy lewdness. Because I would have cleansed you and you were not cleansed from your filthiness, you shall not be cleansed any more till I have satisfied my fury upon you. 
EZK.24.14	I the 
EZK.24.15	Also the word of the 
EZK.24.16	“Son of man, behold, I am about to take the delight of your eyes away from you at a stroke; yet you shall not mourn or weep nor shall your tears run down. 
EZK.24.17	Sigh, but not aloud; make no mourning for the dead. Bind on your turban, and put your shoes on your feet; do not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of mourners.”
EZK.24.18	So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died. And on the next morning I did as I was commanded.
EZK.24.19	And the people said to me, “Will you not tell us what these things mean for us, that you are acting thus?” 
EZK.24.20	Then I said to them, “The word of the 
EZK.24.21	‘Say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.24.22	And you shall do as I have done; you shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of mourners.
EZK.24.23	Your turbans shall be on your heads and your shoes on your feet; you shall not mourn or weep, but you shall pine away in your iniquities and groan to one another. 
EZK.24.24	Thus shall Ezekiel be to you a sign; according to all that he has done you shall do. When this comes, then you will know that I am the Lord 
EZK.24.25	“And you, son of man, on the day when I take from them their stronghold, their joy and glory, the delight of their eyes and their heart's desire, and also their sons and daughters, 
EZK.24.26	on that day a fugitive will come to you to report to you the news. 
EZK.24.27	On that day your mouth will be opened to the fugitive, and you shall speak and be no longer dumb. So you will be a sign to them; and they will know that I am the 
EZK.25.2	“Son of man, set your face toward the Ammonites, and prophesy against them. 
EZK.25.3	Say to the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord 
EZK.25.4	therefore I am handing you over to the people of the East for a possession, and they shall set their encampments among you and make their dwellings in your midst; they shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk. 
EZK.25.5	I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and the cities of the Ammonites
EZK.25.6	For thus says the Lord 
EZK.25.7	therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand against you, and will hand you over as spoil to the nations; and I will cut you off from the peoples and will make you perish out of the countries; I will destroy you. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.25.9	therefore I will lay open the flank of Moab from the cities
EZK.25.10	I will give it along with the Ammonites to the people of the East as a possession, that it

EZK.25.14	And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my wrath; and they shall know my vengeance, says the Lord 
EZK.25.16	therefore thus says the Lord 
EZK.25.17	I will execute great vengeance upon them with wrathful chastisements. Then they will know that I am the

EZK.26.3	therefore thus says the Lord 
EZK.26.4	They shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers; and I will scrape her soil from her, and make her a bare rock. 
EZK.26.5	She shall be in the midst of the sea a place for the spreading of nets; for I have spoken, says the Lord 
EZK.26.6	and her daughters on the mainland shall be slain by the sword. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.26.7	“For thus says the Lord 
EZK.26.8	He will slay with the sword your daughters on the mainland; he will set up a siege wall against you, and throw up a mound against you, and raise a roof of shields against you. 
EZK.26.9	He will direct the shock of his battering rams against your walls, and with his axes he will break down your towers. 
EZK.26.10	His horses will be so many that their dust will cover you; your walls will shake at the noise of the horsemen and wagons and chariots, when he enters your gates as one enters a city which has been breached. 
EZK.26.11	With the hoofs of his horses he will trample all your streets; he will slay your people with the sword; and your mighty pillars will fall to the ground. 
EZK.26.12	They will make a spoil of your riches and a prey of your merchandise; they will break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses; your stones and timber and soil they will cast into the midst of the waters. 
EZK.26.13	 And I will stop the music of your songs, and the sound of your lyres shall be heard no more. 
EZK.26.14	I will make you a bare rock; you shall be a place for the spreading of nets; you shall never be rebuilt; for I the

EZK.26.17	And they will raise a lamentation over you, and say to you,
EZK.26.17	‘How you have vanished
EZK.26.17	O city renowned,
EZK.26.17	that was mighty on the sea,
EZK.26.17	you and your inhabitants,

EZK.26.19	“For thus says the Lord 
EZK.26.20	then I will thrust you down with those who descend into the Pit, to the people of old, and I will make you to dwell in the nether world, among primeval ruins, with those who go down to the Pit, so that you will not be inhabited or have a place
EZK.26.21	I will bring you to a dreadful end, and you shall be no more; though you be sought for, you will never be found again, says the Lord

EZK.27.3	‘I am perfect in beauty.’
EZK.27.4	Your borders are in the heart of the seas;
EZK.27.4	your builders made perfect your beauty.

EZK.27.5	to make a mast for you.
EZK.27.6	Of oaks of Bashan
EZK.27.6	they made your oars;

EZK.28.3	you are indeed wiser than Daniel;
EZK.28.3	no secret is hidden from you;

EZK.28.4	you have gotten wealth for yourself,

EZK.28.15	till iniquity was found in you.
EZK.28.16	In the abundance of your trade
EZK.28.16	you were filled with violence, and you sinned;
EZK.28.16	so I cast you as a profane thing from the mountain of God,
EZK.28.16	and the guardian cherub drove you out
EZK.28.16	from the midst of the stones of fire.
EZK.28.17	Your heart was proud because of your beauty;
EZK.28.17	you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor.

EZK.28.17	to feast their eyes on you.
EZK.28.18	By the multitude of your iniquities,
EZK.28.18	in the unrighteousness of your trade
EZK.28.18	you profaned your sanctuaries;
EZK.28.18	so I brought forth fire from the midst of you;

EZK.30.3	For the day is near,
EZK.30.3	the day of the 
EZK.30.3	it will be a day of clouds,
EZK.30.3	a time of doom for the nations.
EZK.30.4	A sword shall come upon Egypt,
EZK.30.4	and anguish shall be in Ethiopia,
EZK.30.4	when the slain fall in Egypt,
EZK.30.4	and her wealth is carried away,
EZK.30.4	and her foundations are torn down.
EZK.30.5	Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all Arabia, and Libya,
EZK.30.6	“Thus says the 
EZK.30.6	Those who support Egypt shall fall,
EZK.30.6	and her proud might shall come down;
EZK.30.6	from Migdol to Syene
EZK.30.6	they shall fall within her by the sword,
EZK.30.6	says the Lord 
EZK.30.7	And she
EZK.30.7	and her cities shall be in the midst of cities that are laid waste.
EZK.30.8	Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.30.8	when I have set fire to Egypt,
EZK.30.8	and all her helpers are broken.
EZK.30.9	“On that day swift
EZK.30.10	“Thus says the Lord 
EZK.30.10	I will put an end to the wealth
EZK.30.10	by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.
EZK.30.11	He and his people with him, the most terrible of the nations,
EZK.30.11	shall be brought in to destroy the land;
EZK.30.11	and they shall draw their swords against Egypt,
EZK.30.11	and fill the land with the slain.
EZK.30.12	And I will dry up the Nile,
EZK.30.12	and will sell the land into the hand of evil men;
EZK.30.12	I will bring desolation upon the land and everything in it,

EZK.30.13	I will destroy the idols,
EZK.30.13	and put an end to the images, in Memphis;
EZK.30.13	there shall no longer be a prince in the land of Egypt;
EZK.30.13	so I will put fear in the land of Egypt.
EZK.30.14	I will make Pathros a desolation,
EZK.30.14	and will set fire to Zoan,
EZK.30.14	and will execute acts of judgment upon Thebes.
EZK.30.15	And I will pour my wrath upon Pelusium,
EZK.30.15	the stronghold of Egypt,
EZK.30.15	and cut off the multitude of Thebes.
EZK.30.16	And I will set fire to Egypt;
EZK.30.16	Pelusium shall be in great agony;
EZK.30.16	Thebes shall be breached,
EZK.30.16	and its walls broken down.
EZK.30.17	The young men of On and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword;

EZK.30.18	At Tehaphnehes the day shall be dark,
EZK.30.18	when I break there the dominion of Egypt,
EZK.30.18	and her proud might shall come to an end;
EZK.30.18	she shall be covered by a cloud,
EZK.30.18	and her daughters shall go into captivity.
EZK.30.19	Thus I will execute acts of judgment upon Egypt.
EZK.30.19	Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.30.20	In the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, the word of the 
EZK.30.21	“Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and lo, it has not been bound up, to heal it by binding it with a bandage, so that it may become strong to wield the sword. 
EZK.30.22	Therefore thus says the Lord 
EZK.30.23	I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries. 
EZK.30.24	And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand; but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he will groan before him like a man mortally wounded. 
EZK.30.25	I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, but the arms of Pharaoh shall fall; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.30.26	and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them throughout the countries. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.31.1	In the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, the word of the 
EZK.31.2	“Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitude:
EZK.31.2	“Whom are you like in your greatness?
EZK.31.3	Behold, I will liken you to
EZK.31.3	with fair branches and forest shade,
EZK.31.3	and of great height,
EZK.31.3	its top among the clouds.
EZK.31.4	The waters nourished it,
EZK.31.4	the deep made it grow tall,
EZK.31.4	making its rivers flow
EZK.31.4	round the place of its planting,
EZK.31.4	sending forth its streams
EZK.31.4	to all the trees of the forest.
EZK.31.5	So it towered high
EZK.31.5	above all the trees of the forest;
EZK.31.5	its boughs grew large
EZK.31.5	and its branches long,
EZK.31.5	from abundant water in its shoots.
EZK.31.6	made their nests in its boughs;
EZK.31.6	under its branches all the beasts of the field
EZK.31.6	brought forth their young;
EZK.31.6	and under its shadow
EZK.31.6	dwelt all great nations.
EZK.31.7	It was beautiful in its greatness,
EZK.31.7	in the length of its branches;
EZK.31.7	for its roots went down
EZK.31.7	to abundant waters.
EZK.31.8	nor the fir trees equal its boughs;
EZK.31.8	the plane trees were as nothing
EZK.31.8	compared with its branches;
EZK.31.8	no tree in the garden of God
EZK.31.8	was like it in beauty.
EZK.31.9	I made it beautiful
EZK.31.9	in the mass of its branches,
EZK.31.9	and all the trees of Eden envied it,
EZK.31.9	that were in the garden of God.
EZK.31.10	“Therefore thus says the Lord 
EZK.31.11	I will give it into the hand of a mighty one of the nations; he shall surely deal with it as its wickedness deserves. I have cast it out. 
EZK.31.12	Foreigners, the most terrible of the nations, will cut it down and leave it. On the mountains and in all the valleys its branches will fall, and its boughs will lie broken in all the watercourses of the land; and all the peoples of the earth will go from its shadow and leave it. 
EZK.31.13	Upon its ruin will dwell all the birds of the air, and upon its branches will be all the beasts of the field. 
EZK.31.14	All this is in order that no trees by the waters may grow to lofty height or set their tops among the clouds,
EZK.31.15	“Thus says the Lord 
EZK.31.16	I will make the nations quake at the sound of its fall, when I cast it down to Sheol with those who go down to the Pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, will be comforted in the nether world. 
EZK.31.17	They also shall go down to Sheol with it, to those who are slain by the sword; yea, those who dwelt under its shadow among the nations shall perish.
EZK.31.18	Whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? You shall be brought down with the trees of Eden to the nether world; you shall lie among the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword.
EZK.31.18	“This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord 
EZK.32.1	In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the 
EZK.32.2	“Son of man, raise a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him:
EZK.32.2	“You consider yourself a lion among the nations,
EZK.32.2	but you are like a dragon in the seas;
EZK.32.2	you burst forth in your rivers,
EZK.32.2	trouble the waters with your feet,
EZK.32.2	and foul their rivers.
EZK.32.3	Thus says the Lord 
EZK.32.3	I will throw my net over you
EZK.32.3	with a host of many peoples;
EZK.32.3	and I
EZK.32.4	And I will cast you on the ground,
EZK.32.4	on the open field I will fling you,
EZK.32.4	and will cause all the birds of the air to settle on you,
EZK.32.4	and I will gorge the beasts of the whole earth with you.
EZK.32.5	I will strew your flesh upon the mountains,
EZK.32.5	and fill the valleys with your carcass.
EZK.32.6	I will drench the land even to the mountains
EZK.32.6	with your flowing blood;
EZK.32.6	and the watercourses will be full of you.
EZK.32.7	When I blot you out, I will cover the heavens,
EZK.32.7	and make their stars dark;
EZK.32.7	I will cover the sun with a cloud,
EZK.32.7	and the moon shall not give its light.
EZK.32.8	All the bright lights of heaven
EZK.32.8	will I make dark over you,
EZK.32.8	and put darkness upon your land,
EZK.32.8	says the Lord 
EZK.32.9	“I will trouble the hearts of many peoples, when I carry you captive
EZK.32.10	I will make many peoples appalled at you, and their kings shall shudder because of you, when I brandish my sword before them; they shall tremble every moment, every one for his own life, on the day of your downfall. 
EZK.32.11	For thus says the Lord 
EZK.32.12	I will cause your multitude to fall by the swords of mighty ones, all of them most terrible among the nations.
EZK.32.12	“They shall bring to naught the pride of Egypt,
EZK.32.12	and all its multitude shall perish.
EZK.32.13	I will destroy all its beasts
EZK.32.13	from beside many waters;
EZK.32.13	and no foot of man shall trouble them any more,
EZK.32.13	nor shall the hoofs of beasts trouble them.
EZK.32.14	Then I will make their waters clear,
EZK.32.14	and cause their rivers to run like oil,
EZK.32.14	says the Lord 
EZK.32.15	When I make the land of Egypt desolate
EZK.32.15	and when the land is stripped of all that fills it,
EZK.32.15	when I smite all who dwell in it,
EZK.32.15	then they will know that I am the 
EZK.32.16	This is a lamentation which shall be chanted; the daughters of the nations shall chant it; over Egypt, and over all her multitude, shall they chant it, says the Lord 
EZK.32.17	In the twelfth year, in the first month,
EZK.32.18	“Son of man, wail over the multitude of Egypt, and send them down, her and the daughters of majestic nations, to the nether world, to those who have gone down to the Pit:
EZK.32.19	‘Whom do you surpass in beauty?
EZK.32.19	Go down, and be laid with the uncircumcised.’
EZK.32.20	They shall fall amid those who are slain by the sword,
EZK.32.21	The mighty chiefs shall speak of them, with their helpers, out of the midst of Sheol: ‘They have come down, they lie still, the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.’
EZK.32.22	“Assyria is there, and all her company, their graves round about her, all of them slain, fallen by the sword; 
EZK.32.23	whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the Pit, and her company is round about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who spread terror in the land of the living.
EZK.32.24	“Elam is there, and all her multitude about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who went down uncircumcised into the nether world, who spread terror in the land of the living, and they bear their shame with those who go down to the Pit. 
EZK.32.25	They have made her a bed among the slain with all her multitude, their graves round about her, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for terror of them was spread in the land of the living, and they bear their shame with those who go down to the Pit; they are placed among the slain.
EZK.32.26	“Meshech and Tubal are there, and all their multitude, their graves round about them, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for they spread terror in the land of the living. 
EZK.32.27	And they do not lie with the fallen mighty men of old
EZK.32.28	So you shall be broken and lie among the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword.
EZK.32.29	“Edom is there, her kings and all her princes, who for all their might are laid with those who are slain by the sword; they lie with the uncircumcised, with those who go down to the Pit.
EZK.32.30	“The princes of the north are there, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who have gone down in shame with the slain, for all the terror which they caused by their might; they lie uncircumcised with those who are slain by the sword, and bear their shame with those who go down to the Pit.
EZK.32.31	“When Pharaoh sees them, he will comfort himself for all his multitude, Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword, says the Lord 
EZK.32.32	For he
EZK.33.2	“Son of man, speak to your people and say to them, If I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them, and make him their watchman; 
EZK.33.3	and if he sees the sword coming upon the land and blows the trumpet and warns the people; 
EZK.33.4	then if any one who hears the sound of the trumpet does not take warning, and the sword comes and takes him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. 
EZK.33.5	He heard the sound of the trumpet, and did not take warning; his blood shall be upon himself. But if he had taken warning, he would have saved his life. 
EZK.33.6	But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, so that the people are not warned, and the sword comes, and takes any one of them; that man is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at the watchman's hand.
EZK.33.7	“So you, son of man, I have made a watchman for the house of Israel; whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me. 
EZK.33.8	If I say to the wicked, O wicked man, you shall surely die, and you do not speak to warn the wicked to turn from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand. 
EZK.33.9	But if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way; he shall die in his iniquity, but you will have saved your life.
EZK.33.10	“And you, son of man, say to the house of Israel, Thus have you said: ‘Our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we waste away because of them; how then can we live?’ 
EZK.33.11	 Say to them, As I live, says the Lord 
EZK.33.12	And you, son of man, say to your people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him when he transgresses; and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall by it when he turns from his wickedness; and the righteous shall not be able to live by his righteousness
EZK.33.13	Though I say to the righteous that he shall surely live, yet if he trusts in his righteousness and commits iniquity, none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered; but in the iniquity that he has committed he shall die. 
EZK.33.14	Again, though I say to the wicked, ‘You shall surely die,’ yet if he turns from his sin and does what is lawful and right, 
EZK.33.15	if the wicked restores the pledge, gives back what he has taken by robbery, and walks in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die. 
EZK.33.16	None of the sins that he has committed shall be remembered against him; he has done what is lawful and right, he shall surely live.
EZK.33.17	“Yet your people say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just’; when it is their own way that is not just. 
EZK.33.18	When the righteous turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, he shall die for it. 
EZK.33.19	And when the wicked turns from his wickedness, and does what is lawful and right, he shall live by it. 
EZK.33.20	Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ O house of Israel, I will judge each of you according to his ways.”
EZK.33.21	In the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, a man who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said, “The city has fallen.” 
EZK.33.22	Now the hand of the 
EZK.33.23	The word of the 
EZK.33.24	“Son of man, the inhabitants of these waste places in the land of Israel keep saying, ‘Abraham was only one man, yet he got possession of the land; but we are many; the land is surely given us to possess.’ 
EZK.33.25	Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.33.26	You resort to the sword, you commit abominations and each of you defiles his neighbor's wife; shall you then possess the land? 
EZK.33.27	Say this to them, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.33.28	And I will make the land a desolation and a waste; and her proud might shall come to an end; and the mountains of Israel shall be so desolate that none will pass through. 
EZK.33.29	Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.33.30	“As for you, son of man, your people who talk together about you by the walls and at the doors of the houses, say to one another, each to his brother, ‘Come, and hear what the word is that comes forth from the 
EZK.33.31	And they come to you as people come, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear what you say but they will not do it; for with their lips they show much love, but their heart is set on their gain. 
EZK.33.32	And lo, you are to them like one who sings love songs
EZK.33.33	When this comes—and come it will!—then they will know that a prophet has been among them.”
EZK.34.1	The word of the 
EZK.34.2	“Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say to them, even to the shepherds, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.34.3	You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fatlings; but you do not feed the sheep. 
EZK.34.4	The weak you have not strengthened, the sick you have not healed, the crippled you have not bound up, the strayed you have not brought back, the lost you have not sought, and with force and harshness you have ruled them. 
EZK.34.5	 So they were scattered, because there was no shepherd; and they became food for all the wild beasts. 
EZK.34.6	My sheep were scattered, they wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill; my sheep were scattered over all the face of the earth, with none to search or seek for them.
EZK.34.7	“Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the 
EZK.34.8	As I live, says the Lord 
EZK.34.9	therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the 
EZK.34.10	Thus says the Lord 
EZK.34.11	“For thus says the Lord 
EZK.34.12	As a shepherd seeks out his flock when some of his sheep
EZK.34.13	And I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the fountains, and in all the inhabited places of the country. 
EZK.34.14	I will feed them with good pasture, and upon the mountain heights of Israel shall be their pasture; there they shall lie down in good grazing land, and on fat pasture they shall feed on the mountains of Israel. 
EZK.34.15	I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will make them lie down, says the Lord 
EZK.34.16	 I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the crippled, and I will strengthen the weak, and the fat and the strong I will watch over;
EZK.34.17	“As for you, my flock, thus says the Lord 
EZK.34.18	Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture; and to drink of clear water, that you must foul the rest with your feet? 
EZK.34.19	And must my sheep eat what you have trodden with your feet, and drink what you have fouled with your feet?
EZK.34.20	“Therefore, thus says the Lord 
EZK.34.21	Because you push with side and shoulder, and thrust at all the weak with your horns, till you have scattered them abroad, 
EZK.34.22	I will save my flock, they shall no longer be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep. 
EZK.34.23	 And I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he shall feed them: he shall feed them and be their shepherd. 
EZK.34.24	And I, the 
EZK.34.25	“I will make with them a covenant of peace and banish wild beasts from the land, so that they may dwell securely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods. 
EZK.34.26	And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will send down the showers in their season; they shall be showers of blessing. 
EZK.34.27	And the trees of the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase, and they shall be secure in their land; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.34.28	They shall no more be a prey to the nations, nor shall the beasts of the land devour them; they shall dwell securely, and none shall make them afraid. 
EZK.34.29	And I will provide for them prosperous
EZK.34.30	And they shall know that I, the 
EZK.34.31	And you are my sheep, the sheep of my pasture,
EZK.35.1	The word of the 
EZK.35.2	“Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it, 
EZK.35.3	and say to it, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.35.4	I will lay your cities waste, and you shall become a desolation; and you shall know that I am the 
EZK.35.5	Because you cherished perpetual enmity, and gave over the people of Israel to the power of the sword at the time of their calamity, at the time of their final punishment; 
EZK.35.6	therefore, as I live, says the Lord 
EZK.35.7	I will make Mount Seir a waste and a desolation; and I will cut off from it all who come and go. 
EZK.35.8	And I will fill your mountains with the slain; on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines those slain with the sword shall fall. 
EZK.35.9	I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities shall not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.35.10	“Because you said, ‘These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will take possession of them,’—although the 
EZK.35.11	therefore, as I live, says the Lord 
EZK.35.12	And you shall know that I, the 
EZK.35.13	And you magnified yourselves against me with your mouth, and multiplied your words against me; I heard it. 
EZK.35.14	Thus says the Lord 
EZK.35.15	As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so I will deal with you; you shall be desolate, Mount Seir, and all Edom, all of it. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.36.1	“And you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the 
EZK.36.2	Thus says the Lord 
EZK.36.3	therefore prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.36.4	therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord 
EZK.36.5	therefore thus says the Lord 
EZK.36.6	Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.36.7	therefore thus says the Lord 
EZK.36.8	“But you, O mountains of Israel, shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people Israel; for they will soon come home. 
EZK.36.9	For behold, I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown; 
EZK.36.10	and I will multiply men upon you, the whole house of Israel, all of it; the cities shall be inhabited and the waste places rebuilt; 
EZK.36.11	and I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and be fruitful; and I will cause you to be inhabited as in your former times, and will do more good to you than ever before. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.36.12	Yea, I will let men walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess you, and you shall be their inheritance, and you shall no longer bereave them of children. 
EZK.36.13	Thus says the Lord 
EZK.36.14	therefore you shall no longer devour men and no longer bereave your nation of children, says the Lord 
EZK.36.15	and I will not let you hear any more the reproach of the nations, and you shall no longer bear the disgrace of the peoples and no longer cause your nation to stumble, says the Lord 
EZK.36.16	The word of the 
EZK.36.17	“Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their ways and their doings; their conduct before me was like the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity. 
EZK.36.18	So I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood which they had shed in the land, for the idols with which they had defiled it. 
EZK.36.19	I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries; in accordance with their conduct and their deeds I judged them. 
EZK.36.20	But when they came to the nations, wherever they came, they profaned my holy name, in that men said of them, ‘These are the people of the 
EZK.36.21	But I had concern for my holy name, which the house of Israel caused to be profaned among the nations to which they came.
EZK.36.22	“Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.36.23	And I will vindicate the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them; and the nations will know that I am the 
EZK.36.24	For I will take you from the nations, and gather you from all the countries, and bring you into your own land. 
EZK.36.25	I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. 
EZK.36.26	 A new heart I will give you, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will take out of your flesh the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. 
EZK.36.27	 And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to observe my ordinances. 
EZK.36.28	You shall dwell in the land which I gave to your fathers; and you shall be my people, and I will be your God. 
EZK.36.29	And I will deliver you from all your uncleannesses; and I will summon the grain and make it abundant and lay no famine upon you. 
EZK.36.30	I will make the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field abundant, that you may never again suffer the disgrace of famine among the nations. 
EZK.36.31	 Then you will remember your evil ways, and your deeds that were not good; and you will loathe yourselves for your iniquities and your abominable deeds. 
EZK.36.32	It is not for your sake that I will act, says the Lord 
EZK.36.33	“Thus says the Lord 
EZK.36.34	And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, instead of being the desolation that it was in the sight of all who passed by. 
EZK.36.35	And they will say, ‘This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are now inhabited and fortified.’ 
EZK.36.36	Then the nations that are left round about you shall know that I, the

EZK.37.6	And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath
EZK.37.7	So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, a rattling; and the bones came together, bone to its bone. 
EZK.37.8	And as I looked, there were sinews on them, and flesh had come upon them, and skin had covered them; but there was no breath in them. 
EZK.37.9	Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath,
EZK.37.10	So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, an exceedingly great host.
EZK.37.11	Then he said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off.’ 
EZK.37.12	Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.37.13	And you shall know that I am the

EZK.37.17	and join them together into one stick, that they may become one in your hand. 
EZK.37.18	And when your people say to you, ‘Will you not show us what you mean by these?’ 
EZK.37.19	say to them, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.37.20	When the sticks on which you write are in your hand before their eyes, 
EZK.37.21	then say to them, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.37.22	and I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king over them all; and they shall be no longer two nations, and no longer divided into two kingdoms. 
EZK.37.23	They shall not defile themselves any more with their idols and their detestable things, or with any of their transgressions; but I will save them from all the backslidings in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.

EZK.38.8	After many days you will be mustered; in the latter years you will go against the land that is restored from war, the land where people were gathered from many nations upon the mountains of Israel, which had been a continual waste; its people were brought out from the nations and now dwell securely, all of them. 
EZK.38.9	You will advance, coming on like a storm, you will be like a cloud covering the land, you and all your hordes, and many peoples with you.
EZK.38.10	“Thus says the Lord 
EZK.38.11	and say, ‘I will go up against the land of unwalled villages; I will fall upon the quiet people who dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having no bars or gates’; 
EZK.38.12	to seize spoil and carry off plunder; to assail the waste places which are now inhabited, and the people who were gathered from the nations, who have gotten cattle and goods, who dwell at the center of the earth. 
EZK.38.13	Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish and all its villages will say to you, ‘Have you come to seize spoil? Have you assembled your hosts to carry off plunder, to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to seize great spoil?’
EZK.38.14	“Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and say to Gog, Thus says the Lord 
EZK.38.15	and come from your place out of the uttermost parts of the north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great host, a mighty army; 
EZK.38.16	you will come up against my people Israel, like a cloud covering the land. In the latter days I will bring you against my land, that the nations may know me, when through you, O Gog, I vindicate my holiness before their eyes.
EZK.38.17	“Thus says the Lord 
EZK.38.18	But on that day, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, says the Lord 
EZK.38.19	For in my jealousy and in my blazing wrath I declare, On that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel; 
EZK.38.20	the fish of the sea, and the birds of the air, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep on the ground, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall quake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the cliffs shall fall, and every wall shall tumble to the ground. 
EZK.38.21	I will summon every kind of terror
EZK.38.22	 With pestilence and bloodshed I will enter into judgment with him; and I will rain upon him and his hordes and the many peoples that are with him, torrential rains and hailstones, fire and brimstone.

EZK.39.4	 You shall fall upon the mountains of Israel, you and all your hordes and the peoples that are with you; I will give you to birds of prey of every sort and to the wild beasts to be devoured. 
EZK.39.5	You shall fall in the open field; for I have spoken, says the Lord 
EZK.39.6	I will send fire on Magog and on those who dwell securely in the coastlands; and they shall know that I am the

EZK.39.10	so that they will not need to take wood out of the field or cut down any out of the forests, for they will make their fires of the weapons; they will despoil those who despoiled them, and plunder those who plundered them, says the Lord

EZK.39.19	And you shall eat fat till you are filled, and drink blood till you are drunk, at the sacrificial feast which I am preparing for you.

EZK.39.24	I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and their transgressions, and hid my face from them.
EZK.39.25	“Therefore thus says the Lord 
EZK.39.26	They shall forget their shame, and all the treachery they have practiced against me, when they dwell securely in their land with none to make them afraid, 
EZK.39.27	when I have brought them back from the peoples and gathered them from their enemies' lands, and through them have vindicated my holiness in the sight of many nations. 
EZK.39.28	Then they shall know that I am the

EZK.40.2	 and brought me in the visions of God into the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mountain, on which was a structure like a city opposite me.
EZK.40.3	 When he brought me there, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like bronze, with a line of flax and a measuring reed in his hand; and he was standing in the gateway. 
EZK.40.4	And the man said to me, “Son of man, look with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your mind upon all that I shall show you, for you were brought here in order that I might show it to you; declare all that you see to the house of Israel.”
EZK.40.5	And behold, there was a wall all around the outside of the temple area, and the length of the measuring reed in the man's hand was six long cubits, each being a cubit and a handbreadth in length; so he measured the thickness of the wall, one reed; and the height, one reed. 
EZK.40.6	Then he went into the gateway facing east, going up its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate, one reed deep;
EZK.40.7	and the side rooms, one reed long, and one reed broad; and the space between the side rooms, five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the vestibule of the gate at the inner end, one reed. 
EZK.40.8	Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway, eight cubits; 
EZK.40.9	and its jambs, two cubits; and the vestibule of the gate was at the inner end. 
EZK.40.10	And there were three side rooms on either side of the east gate; the three were of the same size; and the jambs on either side were of the same size. 
EZK.40.11	Then he measured the breadth of the opening of the gateway, ten cubits; and the breadth of the gateway, thirteen cubits. 
EZK.40.12	There was a barrier before the side rooms, one cubit on either side; and the side rooms were six cubits on either side. 
EZK.40.13	Then he measured the gate from the back
EZK.40.14	He measured also the vestibule, twenty cubits; and round about the vestibule of the gateway was the court.
EZK.40.15	From the front of the gate at the entrance to the end of the inner vestibule of the gate was fifty cubits. 
EZK.40.16	And the gateway had windows round about, narrowing inwards into their jambs in the side rooms, and likewise the vestibule had windows round about inside, and on the jambs were palm trees.
EZK.40.17	Then he brought me into the outer court; and behold, there were chambers and a pavement, round about the court; thirty chambers fronted on the pavement. 
EZK.40.18	And the pavement ran along the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates; this was the lower pavement. 
EZK.40.19	Then he measured the distance from the inner front of
EZK.40.19	Then he went before me to the north, 
EZK.40.20	and behold, there was a gate
EZK.40.21	Its side rooms, three on either side, and its jambs and its vestibule were of the same size as those of the first gate; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits. 
EZK.40.22	And its windows, its vestibule, and its palm trees were of the same size as those of the gate which faced toward the east; and seven steps led up to it; and its vestibule was on the inside. 
EZK.40.23	And opposite the gate on the north, as on the east, was a gate to the inner court; and he measured from gate to gate, a hundred cubits.
EZK.40.24	And he led me toward the south, and behold, there was a gate on the south; and he measured its jambs and its vestibule; they had the same size as the others. 
EZK.40.25	And there were windows round about in it and in its vestibule, like the windows of the others; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits. 
EZK.40.26	And there were seven steps leading up to it, and its vestibule was on the inside; and it had palm trees on its jambs, one on either side. 
EZK.40.27	And there was a gate on the south of the inner court; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south, a hundred cubits.
EZK.40.28	Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate, and he measured the south gate; it was of the same size as the others. 
EZK.40.29	Its side rooms, its jambs, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others; and there were windows round about in it and in its vestibule; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits. 
EZK.40.30	And there were vestibules round about, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits broad. 
EZK.40.31	Its vestibule faced the outer court, and palm trees were on its jambs, and its stairway had eight steps.
EZK.40.32	Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured the gate; it was of the same size as the others. 
EZK.40.33	Its side rooms, its jambs, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others; and there were windows round about in it and in its vestibule; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits. 
EZK.40.34	Its vestibule faced the outer court, and it had palm trees on its jambs, one on either side; and its stairway had eight steps.
EZK.40.35	Then he brought me to the north gate, and he measured it; it had the same size as the others. 
EZK.40.36	Its side rooms, its jambs, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others;
EZK.40.37	Its vestibule
EZK.40.38	There was a chamber with its door in the vestibule of the gate,
EZK.40.39	And in the vestibule of the gate were two tables on either side, on which the burnt offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering were to be slaughtered. 
EZK.40.40	And on the outside of the vestibule
EZK.40.41	Four tables were on the inside, and four tables on the outside of the side of the gate, eight tables, on which the sacrifices were to be slaughtered. 
EZK.40.42	And there were also four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high, on which the instruments were to be laid with which the burnt offerings and the sacrifices were slaughtered. 
EZK.40.43	And hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened round about within. And on the tables the flesh of the offering was to be laid.
EZK.40.44	Then he brought me from without into the inner court, and behold, there were two chambers
EZK.40.45	And he said to me, This chamber which faces south is for the priests who have charge of the temple, 
EZK.40.46	and the chamber which faces north is for the priests who have charge of the altar; these are the sons of Zadok, who alone among the sons of Levi may come near to the 
EZK.40.47	And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar was in front of the temple.
EZK.40.48	Then he brought me to the vestibule of the temple and measured the jambs of the vestibule, five cubits on either side; and the breadth of the gate was fourteen cubits; and the sidewalls of the gate were three cubits
EZK.40.49	The length of the vestibule was twenty cubits, and the breadth twelve
EZK.41.1	Then he brought me to the nave, and measured the jambs; on each side six cubits was the breadth of the jambs.
EZK.41.2	And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sidewalls of the entrance were five cubits on either side; and he measured the length of the nave forty cubits, and its breadth, twenty cubits. 
EZK.41.3	Then he went into the inner room and measured the jambs of the entrance, two cubits; and the breadth of the entrance, six cubits; and the sidewalls
EZK.41.4	And he measured the length of the room, twenty cubits, and its breadth, twenty cubits, beyond the nave. And he said to me, “This is the most holy place.”
EZK.41.5	Then he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits thick; and the breadth of the side chambers, four cubits, round about the temple. 
EZK.41.6	And the side chambers were in three stories, one over another, thirty in each story. There were offsets
EZK.41.7	And the side chambers became broader as they rose
EZK.41.8	I saw also that the temple had a raised platform round about; the foundations of the side chambers measured a full reed of six long cubits. 
EZK.41.9	The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits; and the part of the platform which was left free was five cubits.
EZK.41.10	chambers of the court was a breadth of twenty cubits round about the temple on every side. 
EZK.41.11	And the doors of the side chambers opened on the part of the platform that was left free, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south; and the breadth of the part that was left free was five cubits round about.
EZK.41.12	The building that was facing the temple yard on the west side was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and its length ninety cubits.
EZK.41.13	Then he measured the temple, a hundred cubits long; and the yard and the building with its walls, a hundred cubits long; 
EZK.41.14	also the breadth of the east front of the temple and the yard, a hundred cubits.
EZK.41.15	Then he measured the length of the building facing the yard which was at the west and its walls
EZK.41.15	The nave of the temple and the inner room and the outer
EZK.41.16	were paneled
EZK.41.17	to the space above the door, even to the inner room, and on the outside. And on all the walls round about in the inner room and the nave were carved likenesses
EZK.41.18	of cherubim and palm trees, a palm tree between cherub and cherub. Every cherub had two faces: 
EZK.41.19	the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved on the whole temple round about; 
EZK.41.20	from the floor to above the door cherubim and palm trees were carved on the wall.
EZK.41.21	The doorposts of the nave were squared; and in front of the holy place was something resembling 
EZK.41.22	an altar of wood, three cubits high, two cubits long, and two cubits broad;
EZK.41.23	The nave and the holy place had each a double door. 
EZK.41.24	The doors had two leaves apiece, two swinging leaves for each door. 
EZK.41.25	And on the doors of the nave were carved cherubim and palm trees, such as were carved on the walls; and there was a canopy of wood in front of the vestibule outside. 
EZK.41.26	And there were recessed windows and palm trees on either side, on the sidewalls of the vestibule.
EZK.42.1	Then he led me out into the inner
EZK.42.2	The length of the building which was on the north side
EZK.42.3	Adjoining the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner court, and facing the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery
EZK.42.4	And before the chambers was a passage inward, ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits long,
EZK.42.5	Now the upper chambers were narrower, for the galleries
EZK.42.6	For they were in three stories, and they had no pillars like the pillars of the outer
EZK.42.7	And there was a wall outside parallel to the chambers, toward the outer court, opposite the chambers, fifty cubits long. 
EZK.42.8	For the chambers on the outer court were fifty cubits long, while those opposite the temple were a hundred cubits long. 
EZK.42.9	Below these chambers was an entrance on the east side, as one enters them from the outer court, 
EZK.42.10	where the outside wall begins.
EZK.42.10	On the south
EZK.42.11	with a passage in front of them; they were similar to the chambers on the north, of the same length and breadth, with the same exits
EZK.42.12	And below the south chambers was an entrance on the east side, where one enters the passage, and opposite them was a dividing wall.
EZK.42.13	Then he said to me, “The north chambers and the south chambers opposite the yard are the holy chambers, where the priests who approach the 
EZK.42.14	When the priests enter the holy place, they shall not go out of it into the outer court without laying there the garments in which they minister, for these are holy; they shall put on other garments before they go near to that which is for the people.”
EZK.42.15	Now when he had finished measuring the interior of the temple area, he led me out by the gate which faced east, and measured the temple area round about. 
EZK.42.16	He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred cubits by the measuring reed. 
EZK.42.17	Then he turned and measured
EZK.42.18	Then he turned and measured
EZK.42.19	Then he turned to the west side and measured, five hundred cubits by the measuring reed. 
EZK.42.20	He measured it on the four sides. It had a wall around it, five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits broad, to make a separation between the holy and the common.
EZK.43.1	Afterward he brought me to the gate, the gate facing east. 
EZK.43.2	 And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the east; and the sound of his coming was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shone with his glory. 
EZK.43.3	And
EZK.43.4	As the glory of the 
EZK.43.5	the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the 
EZK.43.6	While the man was standing beside me, I heard one speaking to me out of the temple; 
EZK.43.7	and he said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the people of Israel for ever. And the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their harlotry, and by the dead bodies
EZK.43.8	by setting their threshold by my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them. They have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed, so I have consumed them in my anger. 
EZK.43.9	Now let them put away their idolatry and the dead bodies
EZK.43.10	“And you, son of man, describe to the house of Israel the temple and its appearance and plan,
EZK.43.11	And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, portray
EZK.43.12	This is the law of the temple: the whole territory round about upon the top of the mountain shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the temple.
EZK.43.13	“These are the dimensions of the altar by cubits (the cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth): its base shall be one cubit high,
EZK.43.14	from the base on the ground to the lower ledge, two cubits, with a breadth of one cubit; and from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge, four cubits, with a breadth of one cubit; 
EZK.43.15	and the altar hearth, four cubits; and from the altar hearth projecting upward, four horns, one cubit high.
EZK.43.16	The altar hearth shall be square, twelve cubits long by twelve broad. 
EZK.43.17	The ledge also shall be square, fourteen cubits long by fourteen broad, with a rim around it half a cubit broad, and its base one cubit round about. The steps of the altar shall face east.”
EZK.43.18	And he said to me, “Son of man, thus says the Lord 
EZK.43.19	you shall give to the Levitical priests of the family of Zadok, who draw near to me to minister to me, says the Lord 
EZK.43.20	And you shall take some of its blood, and put it on the four horns of the altar, and on the four corners of the ledge, and upon the rim round about; thus you shall cleanse the altar and make atonement for it. 
EZK.43.21	You shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and it shall be burnt in the appointed place belonging to the temple, outside the sacred area. 
EZK.43.22	And on the second day you shall offer a he-goat without blemish for a sin offering; and the altar shall be cleansed, as it was cleansed with the bull. 
EZK.43.23	When you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a bull without blemish and a ram from the flock without blemish. 
EZK.43.24	You shall present them before the 
EZK.43.25	For seven days you shall provide daily a goat for a sin offering; also a bull and a ram from the flock, without blemish, shall be provided. 
EZK.43.26	Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it, and so consecrate it. 
EZK.43.27	And when they have completed these days, then from the eighth day onward the priests shall offer upon the altar your burnt offerings and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, says the Lord 
EZK.44.1	Then he brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces east; and it was shut. 
EZK.44.2	And he
EZK.44.3	Only the prince may sit in it to eat bread before the 
EZK.44.5	And the 
EZK.44.6	And say to the rebellious house,
EZK.44.7	in admitting foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and flesh, to be in my sanctuary, profaning it,
EZK.44.8	And you have not kept charge of my holy things; but you have set foreigners to keep my charge in my sanctuary.
EZK.44.9	“Therefore
EZK.44.10	But the Levites who went far from me, going astray from me after their idols when Israel went astray, shall bear their punishment. 
EZK.44.11	They shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the temple, and serving in the temple; they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall attend on the people, to serve them. 
EZK.44.12	Because they ministered to them before their idols and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel, therefore I have sworn concerning them, says the Lord 
EZK.44.13	They shall not come near to me, to serve me as priest, nor come near any of my sacred things and the things that are most sacred; but they shall bear their shame, because of the abominations which they have committed. 
EZK.44.14	Yet I will appoint them to keep charge of the temple, to do all its service and all that is to be done in it.
EZK.44.15	“But the Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who kept the charge of my sanctuary when the people of Israel went astray from me, shall come near to me to minister to me; and they shall attend on me to offer me the fat and the blood, says the Lord 
EZK.44.16	they shall enter my sanctuary, and they shall approach my table, to minister to me, and they shall keep my charge. 
EZK.44.17	When they enter the gates of the inner court, they shall wear linen garments; they shall have nothing of wool on them, while they minister at the gates of the inner court, and within. 
EZK.44.18	They shall have linen turbans upon their heads, and linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with anything that causes sweat. 
EZK.44.19	And when they go out into the outer court to the people, they shall put off the garments in which they have been ministering, and lay them in the holy chambers; and they shall put on other garments, lest they communicate holiness to the people with their garments. 
EZK.44.20	They shall not shave their heads or let their locks grow long; they shall only trim the hair of their heads. 
EZK.44.21	No priest shall drink wine, when he enters the inner court. 
EZK.44.22	They shall not marry a widow, or a divorced woman, but only a virgin of the stock of the house of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of a priest. 
EZK.44.23	They shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and show them how to distinguish between the unclean and the clean. 
EZK.44.24	In a controversy they shall act as judges, and they shall judge it according to my judgments. They shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts, and they shall keep my sabbaths holy. 
EZK.44.25	They shall not defile themselves by going near to a dead person; however, for father or mother, for son or daughter, for brother or unmarried sister they may defile themselves. 
EZK.44.26	After he is defiled,
EZK.44.27	And on the day that he goes into the holy place, into the inner court, to minister in the holy place, he shall offer his sin offering, says the Lord 
EZK.44.28	“They shall have no
EZK.44.29	They shall eat the cereal offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs. 
EZK.44.30	And the first of all the first fruits of all kinds, and every offering of all kinds from all your offerings, shall belong to the priests; you shall also give to the priests the first of your coarse meal, that a blessing may rest on your house. 
EZK.44.31	The priests shall not eat of anything, whether bird or beast, that has died of itself or is torn.
EZK.45.1	“When you allot the land as a possession, you shall set apart for the 
EZK.45.2	Of this a square plot of five hundred by five hundred cubits shall be for the sanctuary, with fifty cubits for an open space around it. 
EZK.45.3	And in the holy district you shall measure off a section twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand broad, in which shall be the sanctuary, the most holy place. 
EZK.45.4	It shall be the holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, who minister in the sanctuary and approach the 
EZK.45.5	Another section, twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand cubits broad, shall be for the Levites who minister at the temple, as their possession for cities to live in.
EZK.45.6	“Alongside the portion set apart as the holy district you shall assign for the possession of the city an area five thousand cubits broad, and twenty-five thousand cubits long; it shall belong to the whole house of Israel.
EZK.45.7	“And to the prince shall belong the land on both sides of the holy district and the property of the city, alongside the holy district and the property of the city, on the west and on the east, corresponding in length to one of the tribal portions, and extending from the western to the eastern boundary of the land. 
EZK.45.8	It is to be his property in Israel. And my princes shall no more oppress my people; but they shall let the house of Israel have the land according to their tribes.
EZK.45.9	“Thus says the Lord 
EZK.45.10	“You shall have just balances, a just ephah, and a just bath. 
EZK.45.11	The ephah and the bath shall be of the same measure, the bath containing one tenth of a homer, and the ephah one tenth of a homer; the homer shall be the standard measure. 
EZK.45.12	The shekel shall be twenty gerahs; five shekels shall be five shekels, and ten shekels shall be ten shekels, and your mina shall be fifty shekels.
EZK.45.13	“This is the offering which you shall make: one sixth of an ephah from each homer of wheat, and one sixth of an ephah from each homer of barley, 
EZK.45.14	and as the fixed portion of oil,
EZK.45.15	and one sheep from every flock of two hundred, from the families
EZK.45.16	All the people of the land shall give
EZK.45.17	It shall be the prince's duty to furnish the burnt offerings, cereal offerings, and drink offerings, at the feasts, the new moons, and the sabbaths, all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel: he shall provide the sin offerings, cereal offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.
EZK.45.18	“Thus says the Lord 
EZK.45.19	The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the temple, the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and the posts of the gate of the inner court. 
EZK.45.20	You shall do the same on the seventh day of the month for any one who has sinned through error or ignorance; so you shall make atonement for the temple.
EZK.45.21	“In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you shall celebrate the feast of the passover, and for seven days unleavened bread shall be eaten. 
EZK.45.22	On that day the prince shall provide for himself and all the people of the land a young bull for a sin offering. 
EZK.45.23	And on the seven days of the festival he shall provide as a burnt offering to the 
EZK.45.24	And he shall provide as a cereal offering an ephah for each bull, an ephah for each ram, and a hin of oil to each ephah. 
EZK.45.25	In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month and for the seven days of the feast, he shall make the same provision for sin offerings, burnt offerings, and cereal offerings, and for the oil.
EZK.46.1	“Thus says the Lord 
EZK.46.2	The prince shall enter by the vestibule of the gate from without, and shall take his stand by the post of the gate. The priests shall offer his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate. Then he shall go out, but the gate shall not be shut until evening. 
EZK.46.3	The people of the land shall worship at the entrance of that gate before the 
EZK.46.4	The burnt offering that the prince offers to the 
EZK.46.5	and the cereal offering with the ram shall be an ephah, and the cereal offering with the lambs shall be as much as he is able, together with a hin of oil to each ephah. 
EZK.46.6	On the day of the new moon he shall offer a young bull without blemish, and six lambs and a ram, which shall be without blemish; 
EZK.46.7	as a cereal offering he shall provide an ephah with the bull and an ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he is able, together with a hin of oil to each ephah. 
EZK.46.8	When the prince enters, he shall go in by the vestibule of the gate, and he shall go out by the same way.
EZK.46.9	“When the people of the land come before the 
EZK.46.10	When they go in, the prince shall go in with them; and when they go out, he shall go out.
EZK.46.11	“At the feasts and the appointed seasons the cereal offering with a young bull shall be an ephah, and with a ram an ephah, and with the lambs as much as one is able to give, together with a hin of oil to an ephah. 
EZK.46.12	When the prince provides a freewill offering, either a burnt offering or peace offerings as a freewill offering to the 
EZK.46.13	“He shall provide a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering to the 
EZK.46.14	And he shall provide a cereal offering with it morning by morning, one sixth of an ephah, and one third of a hin of oil to moisten the flour, as a cereal offering to the 
EZK.46.15	Thus the lamb and the meal offering and the oil shall be provided, morning by morning, for a continual burnt offering.
EZK.46.16	“Thus says the Lord 
EZK.46.17	But if he makes a gift out of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall revert to the prince; only his sons may keep a gift from his inheritance. 
EZK.46.18	The prince shall not take any of the inheritance of the people, thrusting them out of their property; he shall give his sons their inheritance out of his own property, so that none of my people shall be dispossessed of his property.”
EZK.46.19	Then he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, to the north row of the holy chambers for the priests; and there I saw a place at the extreme western end of them. 
EZK.46.20	And he said to me, “This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the cereal offering, in order not to bring them out into the outer court and so communicate holiness to the people.”
EZK.46.21	Then he brought me forth to the outer court, and led me to the four corners of the court; and in each corner of the court there was a court— 
EZK.46.22	in the four corners of the court were small
EZK.46.23	On the inside, around each of the four courts was a row of masonry, with hearths made at the bottom of the rows round about. 
EZK.46.24	Then he said to me, “These are the kitchens where those who minister at the temple shall boil the sacrifices of the people.”
EZK.47.2	Then he brought me out by way of the north gate, and led me round on the outside to the outer gate, that faces toward the east;
EZK.47.3	Going on eastward with a line in his hand, the man measured a thousand cubits, and then led me through the water; and it was ankle-deep. 
EZK.47.4	Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water; and it was knee-deep. Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water; and it was up to the loins. 
EZK.47.5	Again he measured a thousand, and it was a river that I could not pass through, for the water had risen; it was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be passed through. 
EZK.47.6	And he said to me, “Son of man, have you seen this?”
EZK.47.6	Then he led me back along the bank of the river. 
EZK.47.7	As I went back, I saw upon the bank of the river very many trees on the one side and on the other. 
EZK.47.8	And he said to me, “This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah; and when it enters the stagnant waters of the sea,
EZK.47.9	And wherever the river
EZK.47.10	Fishermen will stand beside the sea; from En-gedi to En-eglaim it will be a place for the spreading of nets; its fish will be of very many kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea. 
EZK.47.11	But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they are to be left for salt. 
EZK.47.12	And on the banks, on both sides of the river, there will grow all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither nor their fruit fail, but they will bear fresh fruit every month, because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing.”
EZK.47.13	Thus says the Lord 
EZK.47.14	And you shall divide it equally; I swore to give it to your fathers, and this land shall fall to you as your inheritance.
EZK.47.15	“This shall be the boundary of the land: On the north side, from the Great Sea by way of Hethlon to the entrance of Hamath, and on to Zedad,
EZK.47.16	Berothah, Sibraim (which lies on the border between Damascus and Hamath), as far as Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran. 
EZK.47.17	So the boundary shall run from the sea to Hazar-enon, which is on the northern border of Damascus, with the border of Hamath to the north.
EZK.47.18	“On the east side, the boundary shall run from Hazar-enon
EZK.47.19	“On the south side, it shall run from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribath-kadesh, thence along the Brook of Egypt to the Great Sea. This shall be the south side.
EZK.47.20	“On the west side, the Great Sea shall be the boundary to a point opposite the entrance of Hamath. This shall be the west side.
EZK.47.21	“So you shall divide this land among you according to the tribes of Israel. 
EZK.47.22	You shall allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the aliens who reside among you and have begotten children among you. They shall be to you as native-born sons of Israel; with you they shall be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel. 
EZK.47.23	In whatever tribe the alien resides, there you shall assign him his inheritance, says the Lord 
EZK.48.1	“These are the names of the tribes: Beginning at the northern border, from the sea by way
EZK.48.2	Adjoining the territory of Dan, from the east side to the west, Asher, one portion. 
EZK.48.3	Adjoining the territory of Asher, from the east side to the west, Naphtali, one portion. 
EZK.48.4	Adjoining the territory of Naphtali, from the east side to the west, Manasseh, one portion. 
EZK.48.5	Adjoining the territory of Manasseh, from the east side to the west, Ephraim, one portion. 
EZK.48.6	Adjoining the territory of Ephraim, from the east side to the west, Reuben, one portion. 
EZK.48.7	Adjoining the territory of Reuben, from the east side to the west, Judah, one portion.
EZK.48.8	“Adjoining the territory of Judah, from the east side to the west, shall be the portion which you shall set apart, twenty-five thousand cubits in breadth, and in length equal to one of the tribal portions, from the east side to the west, with the sanctuary in the midst of it. 
EZK.48.9	The portion which you shall set apart for the 
EZK.48.10	These shall be the allotments of the holy portion: the priests shall have an allotment measuring twenty-five thousand cubits on the northern side, ten thousand cubits in breadth on the western side, ten thousand in breadth on the eastern side, and twenty-five thousand in length on the southern side, with the sanctuary of the 
EZK.48.11	This shall be for the consecrated priests, the sons
EZK.48.12	And it shall belong to them as a special portion from the holy portion of the land, a most holy place, adjoining the territory of the Levites. 
EZK.48.13	And alongside the territory of the priests, the Levites shall have an allotment twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand in breadth. The whole length shall be twenty-five thousand cubits and the breadth twenty
EZK.48.14	They shall not sell or exchange any of it; they shall not alienate this choice portion of the land, for it is holy to the 
EZK.48.15	“The remainder, five thousand cubits in breadth and twenty-five thousand in length, shall be for ordinary use for the city, for dwellings and for open country. In the midst of it shall be the city; 
EZK.48.16	 and these shall be its dimensions: the north side four thousand five hundred cubits, the south side four thousand five hundred, the east side four thousand five hundred, and the west side four thousand five hundred. 
EZK.48.17	And the city shall have open land: on the north two hundred and fifty cubits, on the south two hundred and fifty, on the east two hundred and fifty, and on the west two hundred and fifty. 
EZK.48.18	The remainder of the length alongside the holy portion shall be ten thousand cubits to the east, and ten thousand to the west, and it shall be alongside the holy portion. Its produce shall be food for the workers of the city. 
EZK.48.19	And the workers of the city, from all the tribes of Israel, shall till it. 
EZK.48.20	The whole portion which you shall set apart shall be twenty-five thousand cubits square, that is, the holy portion together with the property of the city.
EZK.48.21	“What remains on both sides of the holy portion and of the property of the city shall belong to the prince. Extending from the twenty-five thousand cubits of the holy portion to the east border, and westward from the twenty-five thousand cubits to the west border, parallel to the tribal portions, it shall belong to the prince. The holy portion with the sanctuary of the temple in its midst, 
EZK.48.22	and the property of the Levites and the property of the city,
EZK.48.23	“As for the rest of the tribes: from the east side to the west, Benjamin, one portion. 
EZK.48.24	Adjoining the territory of Benjamin, from the east side to the west, Simeon, one portion. 
EZK.48.25	Adjoining the territory of Simeon, from the east side to the west, Issachar, one portion. 
EZK.48.26	Adjoining the territory of Issachar, from the east side to the west, Zebulun, one portion. 
EZK.48.27	Adjoining the territory of Zebulun, from the east side to the west, Gad, one portion. 
EZK.48.28	And adjoining the territory of Gad to the south, the boundary shall run from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh, thence along the Brook of Egypt to the Great Sea. 
EZK.48.29	This is the land which you shall allot as an inheritance among the tribes of Israel, and these are their several portions, says the Lord 
EZK.48.30	“These shall be the exits of the city: On the north side, which is to be four thousand five hundred cubits by measure, 
EZK.48.31	 three gates, the gate of Reuben, the gate of Judah, and the gate of Levi, the gates of the city being named after the tribes of Israel. 
EZK.48.32	On the east side, which is to be four thousand five hundred cubits, three gates, the gate of Joseph, the gate of Benjamin, and the gate of Dan. 
EZK.48.33	On the south side, which is to be four thousand five hundred cubits by measure, three gates, the gate of Simeon, the gate of Issachar, and the gate of Zebulun.

DAN.1.1	In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. 
DAN.1.2	And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with some of the vessels of the house of God; and he brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, and placed the vessels in the treasury of his god. 
DAN.1.3	Then the king commanded Ashpenaz, his chief eunuch, to bring some of the people of Israel, both of the royal family and of the nobility, 
DAN.1.4	youths without blemish, handsome and skilful in all wisdom, endowed with knowledge, understanding learning, and competent to serve in the king's palace, and to teach them the letters and language of the Chaldeans. 
DAN.1.5	The king assigned them a daily portion of the rich food which the king ate, and of the wine which he drank. They were to be educated for three years, and at the end of that time they were to stand before the king. 
DAN.1.6	Among these were Daniel, Hananiah, Misha-el, and Azariah of the tribe of Judah. 
DAN.1.7	And the chief of the eunuchs gave them names: Daniel he called Belteshazzar, Hananiah he called Shadrach, Misha-el he called Meshach, and Azariah he called Abednego.
DAN.1.8	But Daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with the king's rich food, or with the wine which he drank; therefore he asked the chief of the eunuchs to allow him not to defile himself. 
DAN.1.9	And God gave Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs; 
DAN.1.10	and the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, “I fear lest my lord the king, who appointed your food and your drink, should see that you were in poorer condition than the youths who are of your own age. So you would endanger my head with the king.” 
DAN.1.11	Then Daniel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Misha-el, and Azariah, 
DAN.1.12	“Test your servants for ten days; let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink. 
DAN.1.13	Then let our appearance and the appearance of the youths who eat the king's rich food be observed by you, and according to what you see deal with your servants.” 
DAN.1.14	So he hearkened to them in this matter, and tested them for ten days. 
DAN.1.15	At the end of ten days it was seen that they were better in appearance and fatter in flesh than all the youths who ate the king's rich food. 
DAN.1.16	So the steward took away their rich food and the wine they were to drink, and gave them vegetables.
DAN.1.17	As for these four youths, God gave them learning and skill in all letters and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. 
DAN.1.18	At the end of the time, when the king had commanded that they should be brought in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.1.19	And the king spoke with them, and among them all none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Misha-el, and Azariah; therefore they stood before the king. 
DAN.1.20	And in every matter of wisdom and understanding concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his kingdom. 
DAN.1.21	And Daniel continued until the first year of King Cyrus.
DAN.2.1	In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep left him. 
DAN.2.2	Then the king commanded that the magicians, the enchanters, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans be summoned, to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king. 
DAN.2.3	And the king said to them, “I had a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.” 
DAN.2.4	Then the Chaldeans said to the king,
DAN.2.5	The king answered the Chaldeans, “The word from me is sure: if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you shall be torn limb from limb, and your houses shall be laid in ruins. 
DAN.2.6	But if you show the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. Therefore show me the dream and its interpretation.” 
DAN.2.7	They answered a second time, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show its interpretation.” 
DAN.2.8	The king answered, “I know with certainty that you are trying to gain time, because you see that the word from me is sure 
DAN.2.9	that if you do not make the dream known to me, there is but one sentence for you. You have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till the times change. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can show me its interpretation.” 
DAN.2.10	The Chaldeans answered the king, “There is not a man on earth who can meet the king's demand; for no great and powerful king has asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or Chaldean. 
DAN.2.11	The thing that the king asks is difficult, and none can show it to the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.”
DAN.2.12	Because of this the king was angry and very furious, and commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed. 
DAN.2.13	So the decree went forth that the wise men were to be slain, and they sought Daniel and his companions, to slay them. 
DAN.2.14	Then Daniel replied with prudence and discretion to Ari-och, the captain of the king's guard, who had gone out to slay the wise men of Babylon; 
DAN.2.15	he said to Ari-och, the king's captain, “Why is the decree of the king so severe?” Then Ari-och made the matter known to Daniel. 
DAN.2.16	And Daniel went in and besought the king to appoint him a time, that he might show to the king the interpretation.
DAN.2.17	Then Daniel went to his house and made the matter known to Hananiah, Misha-el, and Azariah, his companions, 
DAN.2.18	and told them to seek mercy of the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions might not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. 
DAN.2.19	Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. 
DAN.2.20	Daniel said:
DAN.2.20	“Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever,
DAN.2.20	to whom belong wisdom and might.
DAN.2.21	He changes times and seasons;
DAN.2.21	he removes kings and sets up kings;
DAN.2.21	he gives wisdom to the wise
DAN.2.21	and knowledge to those who have understanding;
DAN.2.22	he reveals deep and mysterious things;
DAN.2.22	he knows what is in the darkness,
DAN.2.22	and the light dwells with him.
DAN.2.23	To thee, O God of my fathers,
DAN.2.23	I give thanks and praise,
DAN.2.23	for thou hast given me wisdom and strength,
DAN.2.23	and hast now made known to me what we asked of thee,
DAN.2.23	for thou hast made known to us the king's matter.”
DAN.2.24	Therefore Daniel went in to Ari-och, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus to him, “Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show the king the interpretation.”
DAN.2.25	Then Ari-och brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus to him: “I have found among the exiles from Judah a man who can make known to the king the interpretation.” 
DAN.2.26	The king said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to make known to me the dream that I have seen and its interpretation?” 
DAN.2.27	Daniel answered the king, “No wise men, enchanters, magicians, or astrologers can show to the king the mystery which the king has asked, 
DAN.2.28	but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days. Your dream and the visions of your head as you lay in bed are these: 
DAN.2.29	To you, O king, as you lay in bed came thoughts of what would be hereafter, and he who reveals mysteries made known to you what is to be. 
DAN.2.30	But as for me, not because of any wisdom that I have more than all the living has this mystery been revealed to me, but in order that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your mind.
DAN.2.31	“You saw, O king, and behold, a great image. This image, mighty and of exceeding brightness, stood before you, and its appearance was frightening. 
DAN.2.32	The head of this image was of fine gold, its breast and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, 
DAN.2.33	its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay. 
DAN.2.34	As you looked, a stone was cut out by no human hand, and it smote the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces; 
DAN.2.35	then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold, all together were broken in pieces, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, so that not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.
DAN.2.36	“This was the dream; now we will tell the king its interpretation. 
DAN.2.37	You, O king, the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the might, and the glory, 
DAN.2.38	and into whose hand he has given, wherever they dwell, the sons of men, the beasts of the field, and the birds of the air, making you rule over them all—you are the head of gold. 
DAN.2.39	After you shall arise another kingdom inferior to you, and yet a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth. 
DAN.2.40	And there shall be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron, because iron breaks to pieces and shatters all things; and like iron which crushes, it shall break and crush all these. 
DAN.2.41	And as you saw the feet and toes partly of potter's clay and partly of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but some of the firmness of iron shall be in it, just as you saw iron mixed with the miry clay. 
DAN.2.42	And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brittle. 
DAN.2.43	As you saw the iron mixed with miry clay, so they will mix with one another in marriage,
DAN.2.44	 And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall its sovereignty be left to another people. It shall break in pieces all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, and it shall stand for ever; 
DAN.2.45	just as you saw that a stone was cut from a mountain by no human hand, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold. A great God has made known to the king what shall be hereafter. The dream is certain, and its interpretation sure.”
DAN.2.46	Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and did homage to Daniel, and commanded that an offering and incense be offered up to him. 
DAN.2.47	The king said to Daniel, “Truly, your God is God of gods and Lord of kings, and a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this mystery.” 
DAN.2.48	Then the king gave Daniel high honors and many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon. 
DAN.2.49	Daniel made request of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon; but Daniel remained at the king's court.
DAN.3.1	King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits and its breadth six cubits. He set it up on the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. 
DAN.3.2	Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent to assemble the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. 
DAN.3.3	Then the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces, were assembled for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. 
DAN.3.4	And the herald proclaimed aloud, “You are commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages, 
DAN.3.5	 that when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up; 
DAN.3.6	and whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace.” 
DAN.3.7	Therefore, as soon as all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, all the peoples, nations, and languages fell down and worshiped the golden image which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
DAN.3.8	Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and maliciously accused the Jews. 
DAN.3.9	They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “O king, live for ever! 
DAN.3.10	You, O king, have made a decree, that every man who hears the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image; 
DAN.3.11	and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into a burning fiery furnace. 
DAN.3.12	There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, pay no heed to you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.”
DAN.3.13	Then Nebuchadnezzar in furious rage commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought. Then they brought these men before the king. 
DAN.3.14	Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image which I have set up? 
DAN.3.15	Now if you are ready when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, to fall down and worship the image which I have made, well and good; but if you do not worship, you shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace; and who is the god that will deliver you out of my hands?”
DAN.3.16	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. 
DAN.3.17	If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.
DAN.3.18	But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.”
DAN.3.19	Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury, and the expression of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He ordered the furnace heated seven times more than it was wont to be heated. 
DAN.3.20	And he ordered certain mighty men of his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. 
DAN.3.21	Then these men were bound in their mantles,
DAN.3.22	Because the king's order was strict and the furnace very hot, the flame of the fire slew those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. 
DAN.3.23	And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell bound into the burning fiery furnace.
DAN.3.24	Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished and rose up in haste. He said to his counselors, “Did we not cast three men bound into the fire?” They answered the king, “True, O king.” 
DAN.3.25	He answered, “But I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are not hurt; and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.”
DAN.3.26	Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the burning fiery furnace and said, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come here!” Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out from the fire. 
DAN.3.27	And the satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the king's counselors gathered together and saw that the fire had not had any power over the bodies of those men; the hair of their heads was not singed, their mantles
DAN.3.28	Nebuchadnezzar said, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants, who trusted in him, and set at naught the king's command, and yielded up their bodies rather than serve and worship any god except their own God. 
DAN.3.29	Therefore I make a decree: Any people, nation, or language that speaks anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be torn limb from limb, and their houses laid in ruins; for there is no other god who is able to deliver in this way.” 
DAN.3.30	Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
DAN.4.2	It has seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has wrought toward me.
DAN.4.3	How great are his signs,
DAN.4.3	how mighty his wonders!
DAN.4.3	His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,
DAN.4.3	and his dominion is from generation to generation.
DAN.4.5	I had a dream which made me afraid; as I lay in bed the fancies and the visions of my head alarmed me. 
DAN.4.6	Therefore I made a decree that all the wise men of Babylon should be brought before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream. 
DAN.4.7	Then the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers came in; and I told them the dream, but they could not make known to me its interpretation. 
DAN.4.8	At last Daniel came in before me—he who was named Belteshazzar after the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods
DAN.4.9	“O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods
DAN.4.10	The visions of my head as I lay in bed were these: I saw, and behold, a tree in the midst of the earth; and its height was great. 
DAN.4.11	The tree grew and became strong, and its top reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of the whole earth. 
DAN.4.12	 Its leaves were fair and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all. The beasts of the field found shade under it, and the birds of the air dwelt in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.
DAN.4.13	“I saw in the visions of my head as I lay in bed, and behold, a watcher, a holy one, came down from heaven. 
DAN.4.14	He cried aloud and said thus, ‘Hew down the tree and cut off its branches, strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit; let the beasts flee from under it and the birds from its branches. 
DAN.4.15	But leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, amid the tender grass of the field. Let him be wet with the dew of heaven; let his lot be with the beasts in the grass of the earth; 
DAN.4.16	let his mind be changed from a man's, and let a beast's mind be given to him; and let seven times pass over him. 
DAN.4.17	The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, the decision by the word of the holy ones, to the end that the living may know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men, and gives it to whom he will, and sets over it the lowliest of men.’ 
DAN.4.18	This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw. And you, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, because all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation, but you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods
DAN.4.19	Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was dismayed for a moment, and his thoughts alarmed him. The king said, “Belteshazzar, let not the dream or the interpretation alarm you.” Belteshazzar answered, “My lord, may the dream be for those who hate you and its interpretation for your enemies! 
DAN.4.20	The tree you saw, which grew and became strong, so that its top reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of the whole earth; 
DAN.4.21	whose leaves were fair and its fruit abundant, and in which was food for all; under which beasts of the field found shade, and in whose branches the birds of the air dwelt— 
DAN.4.22	it is you, O king, who have grown and become strong. Your greatness has grown and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the ends of the earth. 
DAN.4.23	And whereas the king saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, ‘Hew down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field; and let him be wet with the dew of heaven; and let his lot be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him’; 
DAN.4.24	this is the interpretation, O king: It is a decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king, 
DAN.4.25	that you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; you shall be made to eat grass like an ox, and you shall be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over you, till you know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men, and gives it to whom he will. 
DAN.4.26	And as it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, your kingdom shall be sure for you from the time that you know that Heaven rules. 
DAN.4.27	Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you; break off your sins by practicing righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the oppressed, that there may perhaps be a lengthening of your tranquillity.”
DAN.4.28	All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.4.29	At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon, 
DAN.4.30	and the king said, “Is not this great Babylon, which I have built by my mighty power as a royal residence and for the glory of my majesty?” 
DAN.4.31	While the words were still in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, “O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom has departed from you, 
DAN.4.32	and you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; and you shall be made to eat grass like an ox; and seven times shall pass over you, until you have learned that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will.” 
DAN.4.33	Immediately the word was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar. He was driven from among men, and ate grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair grew as long as eagles' feathers, and his nails were like birds' claws.
DAN.4.34	At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored him who lives for ever;
DAN.4.34	for his dominion is an everlasting dominion,
DAN.4.34	and his kingdom endures from generation to generation;
DAN.4.35	all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing;
DAN.4.35	and he does according to his will in the host of heaven
DAN.4.35	and among the inhabitants of the earth;
DAN.4.35	and none can stay his hand
DAN.4.35	or say to him, “What doest thou?”
DAN.4.36	At the same time my reason returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and splendor returned to me. My counselors and my lords sought me, and I was established in my kingdom, and still more greatness was added to me. 
DAN.4.37	Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven; for all his works are right and his ways are just; and those who walk in pride he is able to abase.
DAN.5.1	King Belshazzar made a great feast for a thousand of his lords, and drank wine in front of the thousand.
DAN.5.2	Belshazzar, when he tasted the wine, commanded that the vessels of gold and of silver which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple in Jerusalem be brought, that the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines might drink from them. 
DAN.5.3	Then they brought in the golden and silver vessels
DAN.5.4	They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.
DAN.5.5	Immediately the fingers of a man's hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace, opposite the lampstand; and the king saw the hand as it wrote. 
DAN.5.6	Then the king's color changed, and his thoughts alarmed him; his limbs gave way, and his knees knocked together. 
DAN.5.7	The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers. The king said to the wise men of Babylon, “Whoever reads this writing, and shows me its interpretation, shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.” 
DAN.5.8	Then all the king's wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or make known to the king the interpretation. 
DAN.5.9	Then King Belshazzar was greatly alarmed, and his color changed; and his lords were perplexed.
DAN.5.10	The queen, because of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banqueting hall; and the queen said, “O king, live for ever! Let not your thoughts alarm you or your color change. 
DAN.5.11	There is in your kingdom a man in whom is the spirit of the holy gods.
DAN.5.12	because an excellent spirit, knowledge, and understanding to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve problems were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.”
DAN.5.13	Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king said to Daniel, “You are that Daniel, one of the exiles of Judah, whom the king my father brought from Judah. 
DAN.5.14	I have heard of you that the spirit of the holy gods
DAN.5.15	Now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me to read this writing and make known to me its interpretation; but they could not show the interpretation of the matter. 
DAN.5.16	But I have heard that you can give interpretations and solve problems. Now if you can read the writing and make known to me its interpretation, you shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about your neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.”
DAN.5.17	Then Daniel answered before the king, “Let your gifts be for yourself, and give your rewards to another; nevertheless I will read the writing to the king and make known to him the interpretation. 
DAN.5.18	O king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father kingship and greatness and glory and majesty; 
DAN.5.19	and because of the greatness that he gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him; whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive; whom he would he raised up, and whom he would he put down. 
DAN.5.20	But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and his glory was taken from him; 
DAN.5.21	he was driven from among men, and his mind was made like that of a beast, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; he was fed grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until he knew that the Most High God rules the kingdom of men, and sets over it whom he will. 
DAN.5.22	And you his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this, 
DAN.5.23	but you have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven; and the vessels of his house have been brought in before you, and you and your lords, your wives, and your concubines have drunk wine from them; and you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see or hear or know, but the God in whose hand is your breath, and whose are all your ways, you have not honored.
DAN.5.24	“Then from his presence the hand was sent, and this writing was inscribed. 
DAN.5.25	And this is the writing that was inscribed: 
DAN.5.26	This is the interpretation of the matter: 
DAN.5.27	, you have been weighed in the balances and found wanting; 
DAN.5.28	, your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.”
DAN.5.29	Then Belshazzar commanded, and Daniel was clothed with purple, a chain of gold was put about his neck, and proclamation was made concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
DAN.5.30	That very night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was slain. 
DAN.5.31	And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old.
DAN.6.1	It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, to be throughout the whole kingdom; 
DAN.6.2	and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one, to whom these satraps should give account, so that the king might suffer no loss. 
DAN.6.3	Then this Daniel became distinguished above all the other presidents and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom. 
DAN.6.4	Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find a ground for complaint against Daniel with regard to the kingdom; but they could find no ground for complaint or any fault, because he was faithful, and no error or fault was found in him. 
DAN.6.5	Then these men said, “We shall not find any ground for complaint against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God.”
DAN.6.6	Then these presidents and satraps came by agreement
DAN.6.7	All the presidents of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the counselors and the governors are agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an interdict, that whoever makes petition to any god or man for thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions. 
DAN.6.8	Now, O king, establish the interdict and sign the document, so that it cannot be changed, according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, which cannot be revoked.” 
DAN.6.9	Therefore King Darius signed the document and interdict.
DAN.6.10	When Daniel knew that the document had been signed, he went to his house where he had windows in his upper chamber open toward Jerusalem; and he got down upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously. 
DAN.6.11	Then these men came by agreement
DAN.6.12	Then they came near and said before the king, concerning the interdict, “O king! Did you not sign an interdict, that any man who makes petition to any god or man within thirty days except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?” The king answered, “The thing stands fast, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be revoked.” 
DAN.6.13	Then they answered before the king, “That Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no heed to you, O king, or the interdict you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.”
DAN.6.14	Then the king, when he heard these words, was much distressed, and set his mind to deliver Daniel; and he labored till the sun went down to rescue him. 
DAN.6.15	Then these men came by agreement
DAN.6.16	Then the king commanded, and Daniel was brought and cast into the den of lions. The king said to Daniel, “May your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!” 
DAN.6.17	And a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords, that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel. 
DAN.6.18	Then the king went to his palace, and spent the night fasting; no diversions were brought to him, and sleep fled from him.
DAN.6.19	Then, at break of day, the king arose and went in haste to the den of lions. 
DAN.6.20	When he came near to the den where Daniel was, he cried out in a tone of anguish and said to Daniel, “O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?” 
DAN.6.21	Then Daniel said to the king, “O king, live for ever! 
DAN.6.22	 My God sent his angel and shut the lions' mouths, and they have not hurt me, because I was found blameless before him; and also before you, O king, I have done no wrong.” 
DAN.6.23	Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of hurt was found upon him, beause he had trusted in his God. 
DAN.6.24	And the king commanded, and those men who had accused Daniel were brought and cast into the den of lions—they, their children, and their wives; and before they reached the bottom of the den the lions overpowered them and broke all their bones in pieces.
DAN.6.25	Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth: “Peace be multiplied to you. 
DAN.6.26	I make a decree, that in all my royal dominion men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel,
DAN.6.26	for he is the living God,
DAN.6.26	enduring for ever;
DAN.6.26	his kingdom shall never be destroyed,
DAN.6.26	and his dominion shall be to the end.
DAN.6.27	He delivers and rescues,
DAN.6.27	he works signs and wonders
DAN.6.27	in heaven and on earth,
DAN.6.27	he who has saved Daniel
DAN.6.27	from the power of the lions.”
DAN.6.28	So this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
DAN.7.1	In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head as he lay in his bed. Then he wrote down the dream, and told the sum of the matter. 
DAN.7.2	Daniel said, “I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea. 
DAN.7.4	 The first was like a lion and had eagles' wings. Then as I looked its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand upon two feet like a man; and the mind of a man was given to it. 
DAN.7.5	And behold, another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side; it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, ‘Arise, devour much flesh.’ 
DAN.7.6	After this I looked, and lo, another, like a leopard, with four wings of a bird on its back; and the beast had four heads; and dominion was given to it. 
DAN.7.7	 After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, terrible and dreadful and exceedingly strong; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns. 
DAN.7.8	 I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things. 
DAN.7.9	 As I looked,
DAN.7.9	thrones were placed
DAN.7.9	and one that was ancient of days took his seat;
DAN.7.9	his raiment was white as snow,
DAN.7.9	and the hair of his head like pure wool;
DAN.7.9	his throne was fiery flames,
DAN.7.9	its wheels were burning fire.
DAN.7.10	and came forth from before him;
DAN.7.10	a thousand thousands served him,
DAN.7.10	and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him;
DAN.7.10	the court sat in judgment,
DAN.7.10	and the books were opened.
DAN.7.11	“I looked then because of the sound of the great words which the horn was speaking. And as I looked, the beast was slain, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire. 
DAN.7.12	As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time. 
DAN.7.13	 I saw in the night visions,
DAN.7.13	and behold, with the clouds of heaven
DAN.7.13	there came one like a son of man,
DAN.7.13	and he came to the Ancient of Days
DAN.7.13	and was presented before him.
DAN.7.14	and glory and kingdom,
DAN.7.14	that all peoples, nations, and languages
DAN.7.14	should serve him;
DAN.7.14	his dominion is an everlasting dominion,
DAN.7.14	which shall not pass away,
DAN.7.14	and his kingdom one
DAN.7.14	that shall not be destroyed.
DAN.7.15	“As for me, Daniel, my spirit within me was anxious and the visions of my head alarmed me. 
DAN.7.16	I approached one of those who stood there and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made known to me the interpretation of the things. 
DAN.7.17	‘These four great beasts are four kings who shall arise out of the earth. 
DAN.7.18	But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, for ever and ever.’
DAN.7.19	“Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was different from all the rest, exceedingly terrible, with its teeth of iron and claws of bronze; and which devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet; 
DAN.7.20	 and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up and before which three of them fell, the horn which had eyes and a mouth that spoke great things, and which seemed greater than its fellows. 
DAN.7.21	 As I looked, this horn made war with the saints, and prevailed over them, 
DAN.7.22	until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High, and the time came when the saints received the kingdom.
DAN.7.23	“Thus he said: ‘As for the fourth beast,
DAN.7.23	there shall be a fourth kingdom on earth,
DAN.7.23	which shall be different from all the kingdoms,
DAN.7.23	and it shall devour the whole earth,
DAN.7.23	and trample it down, and break it to pieces.
DAN.7.24	As for the ten horns,
DAN.7.24	out of this kingdom
DAN.7.24	ten kings shall arise,
DAN.7.24	and another shall arise after them;
DAN.7.24	he shall be different from the former ones,
DAN.7.24	and shall put down three kings.
DAN.7.25	and shall wear out the saints of the Most High,
DAN.7.25	and shall think to change the times and the law;
DAN.7.25	and they shall be given into his hand
DAN.7.25	for a time, two times, and half a time.
DAN.7.26	But the court shall sit in judgment,
DAN.7.26	and his dominion shall be taken away,
DAN.7.26	to be consumed and destroyed to the end.
DAN.7.27	And the kingdom and the dominion
DAN.7.27	and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven
DAN.7.27	shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High;
DAN.7.27	their kingdom shall be an everlasting kingdom,
DAN.7.27	and all dominions shall serve and obey them.’
DAN.7.28	“Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly alarmed me, and my color changed; but I kept the matter in my mind.”
DAN.8.1	In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first. 
DAN.8.2	And I saw in the vision; and when I saw, I was in Susa the capital, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was at the river Ulai. 
DAN.8.3	I raised my eyes and saw, and behold, a ram standing on the bank of the river. It had two horns; and both horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last. 
DAN.8.4	I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward; no beast could stand before him, and there was no one who could rescue from his power; he did as he pleased and magnified himself.
DAN.8.5	As I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west across the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground; and the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes. 
DAN.8.6	He came to the ram with the two horns, which I had seen standing on the bank of the river, and he ran at him in his mighty wrath. 
DAN.8.7	I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged against him and struck the ram and broke his two horns; and the ram had no power to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground and trampled upon him; and there was no one who could rescue the ram from his power. 
DAN.8.8	Then the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly; but when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and instead of it there came up four conspicuous horns toward the four winds of heaven.
DAN.8.9	Out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the glorious land. 
DAN.8.10	 It grew great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them. 
DAN.8.11	It magnified itself, even up to the Prince of the host; and the continual burnt offering was taken away from him, and the place of his sanctuary was overthrown. 
DAN.8.12	And the host was given over to it together with the continual burnt offering through transgression;
DAN.8.13	 Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to the one that spoke, “For how long is the vision concerning the continual burnt offering, the transgression that makes desolate, and the giving over of the sanctuary and host to be trampled under foot?”
DAN.8.14	And he said to him,
DAN.8.15	When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it; and behold, there stood before me one having the appearance of a man. 
DAN.8.16	And I heard a man's voice between the banks of the Ulai, and it called, “Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.” 
DAN.8.17	So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was frightened and fell upon my face. But he said to me, “Understand, O son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end.”
DAN.8.18	As he was speaking to me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground; but he touched me and set me on my feet. 
DAN.8.19	He said, “Behold, I will make known to you what shall be at the latter end of the indignation; for it pertains to the appointed time of the end. 
DAN.8.20	As for the ram which you saw with the two horns, these are the kings of Media and Persia. 
DAN.8.21	And the he-goat
DAN.8.22	As for the horn that was broken, in place of which four others arose, four kingdoms shall arise from his
DAN.8.23	And at the latter end of their rule, when the transgressors have reached their full measure, a king of bold countenance, one who understands riddles, shall arise. 
DAN.8.24	His power shall be great,
DAN.8.25	By his cunning he shall make deceit prosper under his hand, and in his own mind he shall magnify himself. Without warning he shall destroy many; and he shall even rise up against the Prince of princes; but, by no human hand, he shall be broken. 
DAN.8.26	The vision of the evenings and the mornings which has been told is true; but seal up the vision, for it pertains to many days hence.”
DAN.8.27	And I, Daniel, was overcome and lay sick for some days; then I rose and went about the king's business; but I was appalled by the vision and did not understand it.
DAN.9.1	In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasu-erus, by birth a Mede, who became king over the realm of the Chaldeans— 
DAN.9.2	in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, perceived in the books the number of years which, according to the word of the 
DAN.9.3	Then I turned my face to the Lord God, seeking him by prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes. 
DAN.9.4	I prayed to the 
DAN.9.5	we have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly and rebelled, turning aside from thy commandments and ordinances; 
DAN.9.6	we have not listened to thy servants the prophets, who spoke in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land. 
DAN.9.7	To thee, O Lord, belongs righteousness, but to us confusion of face, as at this day, to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, those that are near and those that are far away, in all the lands to which thou hast driven them, because of the treachery which they have committed against thee. 
DAN.9.8	To us, O Lord, belongs confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee. 
DAN.9.9	To the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness; because we have rebelled against him, 
DAN.9.10	and have not obeyed the voice of the 
DAN.9.11	All Israel has transgressed thy law and turned aside, refusing to obey thy voice. And the curse and oath which are written in the law of Moses the servant of God have been poured out upon us, because we have sinned against him. 
DAN.9.12	He has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us and against our rulers who ruled us, by bringing upon us a great calamity; for under the whole heaven there has not been done the like of what has been done against Jerusalem. 
DAN.9.13	As it is written in the law of Moses, all this calamity has come upon us, yet we have not entreated the favor of the 
DAN.9.14	Therefore the 
DAN.9.15	And now, O Lord our God, who didst bring thy people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast made thee a name, as at this day, we have sinned, we have done wickedly. 
DAN.9.16	O Lord, according to all thy righteous acts, let thy anger and thy wrath turn away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy hill; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people have become a byword among all who are round about us. 
DAN.9.17	Now therefore, O our God, hearken to the prayer of thy servant and to his supplications, and for thy own sake, O Lord,
DAN.9.18	O my God, incline thy ear and hear; open thy eyes and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name; for we do not present our supplications before thee on the ground of our righteousness, but on the ground of thy great mercy. 
DAN.9.19	O 
DAN.9.20	While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the 
DAN.9.21	while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the first, came to me in swift flight at the time of the evening sacrifice. 
DAN.9.22	He came
DAN.9.23	At the beginning of your supplications a word went forth, and I have come to tell it to you, for you are greatly beloved; therefore consider the word and understand the vision.
DAN.9.24	“Seventy weeks of years are decreed concerning your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to put an end to sin, and to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal both vision and prophet, and to anoint a most holy place.
DAN.9.25	Know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the word to restore and build Jerusalem to the coming of an anointed one, a prince, there shall be seven weeks. Then for sixty-two weeks it shall be built again with squares and moat, but in a troubled time. 
DAN.9.26	And after the sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off, and shall have nothing; and the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its
DAN.9.27	 And he shall make a strong covenant with many for one week; and for half of the week he shall cause sacrifice and offering to cease; and upon the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate, until the decreed end is poured out on the desolator.”
DAN.10.1	In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a word was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshazzar. And the word was true, and it was a great conflict. And he understood the word and had understanding of the vision.
DAN.10.2	In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three weeks. 
DAN.10.3	I ate no delicacies, no meat or wine entered my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, for the full three weeks. 
DAN.10.4	On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river, that is, the Tigris, 
DAN.10.5	 I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with gold of Uphaz. 
DAN.10.6	His body was like beryl, his face like the appearance of lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and the sound of his words like the noise of a multitude. 
DAN.10.7	And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great trembling fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves. 
DAN.10.8	So I was left alone and saw this great vision, and no strength was left in me; my radiant appearance was fearfully changed, and I retained no strength. 
DAN.10.9	Then I heard the sound of his words; and when I heard the sound of his words, I fell on my face in deep sleep with my face to the ground.
DAN.10.10	And behold, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees. 
DAN.10.11	And he said to me, “O Daniel, man greatly beloved, give heed to the words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for now I have been sent to you.” While he was speaking this word to me, I stood up trembling. 
DAN.10.12	Then he said to me, “Fear not, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your mind to understand and humbled yourself before your God, your words have been heard, and I have come because of your words. 
DAN.10.13	 The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days; but Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, so I left him there with the prince of the kingdom of Persia
DAN.10.14	and came to make you understand what is to befall your people in the latter days. For the vision is for days yet to come.”
DAN.10.15	When he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground and was dumb. 
DAN.10.16	And behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips; then I opened my mouth and spoke. I said to him who stood before me, “O my lord, by reason of the vision pains have come upon me, and I retain no strength. 
DAN.10.17	How can my lord's servant talk with my lord? For now no strength remains in me, and no breath is left in me.”
DAN.10.18	Again one having the appearance of a man touched me and strengthened me. 
DAN.10.19	And he said, “O man greatly beloved, fear not, peace be with you; be strong and of good courage.” And when he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, “Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.” 
DAN.10.20	Then he said, “Do you know why I have come to you? But now I will return to fight against the prince of Persia; and when I am through with him, lo, the prince of Greece will come. 
DAN.10.21	But I will tell you what is inscribed in the book of truth: there is none who contends by my side against these except Michael, your prince.
DAN.11.1	And as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to confirm and strengthen him.
DAN.11.2	“And now I will show you the truth. Behold, three more kings shall arise in Persia; and a fourth shall be far richer than all of them; and when he has become strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the kingdom of Greece. 
DAN.11.3	Then a mighty king shall arise, who shall rule with great dominion and do according to his will. 
DAN.11.4	And when he has arisen, his kingdom shall be broken and divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to the dominion with which he ruled; for his kingdom shall be plucked up and go to others besides these.
DAN.11.5	“Then the king of the south shall be strong, but one of his princes shall be stronger than he and his dominion shall be a great dominion. 
DAN.11.6	After some years they shall make an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make peace; but she shall not retain the strength of her arm, and he and his offspring shall not endure; but she shall be given up, and her attendants, her child, and he who got possession of
DAN.11.7	“In those times a branch
DAN.11.8	He shall also carry off to Egypt their gods with their molten images and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and for some years he shall refrain from attacking the king of the north. 
DAN.11.9	Then the latter shall come into the realm of the king of the south but shall return into his own land.
DAN.11.10	“His sons shall wage war and assemble a multitude of great forces, which shall come on and overflow and pass through, and again shall carry the war as far as his fortress. 
DAN.11.11	Then the king of the south, moved with anger, shall come out and fight with the king of the north; and he shall raise a great multitude, but it shall be given into his hand. 
DAN.11.12	And when the multitude is taken, his heart shall be exalted, and he shall cast down tens of thousands, but he shall not prevail. 
DAN.11.13	For the king of the north shall again raise a multitude, greater than the former; and after some years
DAN.11.14	“In those times many shall rise against the king of the south; and the men of violence among your own people shall lift themselves up in order to fulfil the vision; but they shall fail. 
DAN.11.15	Then the king of the north shall come and throw up siegeworks, and take a well-fortified city. And the forces of the south shall not stand, or even his picked troops, for there shall be no strength to stand. 
DAN.11.16	But he who comes against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him; and he shall stand in the glorious land, and all of it shall be in his power. 
DAN.11.17	He shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and he shall bring terms of peace
DAN.11.18	Afterward he shall turn his face to the coastlands, and shall take many of them; but a commander shall put an end to his insolence; indeed
DAN.11.19	Then he shall turn his face back toward the fortresses of his own land; but he shall stumble and fall, and shall not be found.
DAN.11.20	“Then shall arise in his place one who shall send an exactor of tribute through the glory of the kingdom; but within a few days he shall be broken, neither in anger nor in battle. 
DAN.11.21	In his place shall arise a contemptible person to whom royal majesty has not been given; he shall come in without warning and obtain the kingdom by flatteries. 
DAN.11.22	Armies shall be utterly swept away before him and broken, and the prince of the covenant also. 
DAN.11.23	And from the time that an alliance is made with him he shall act deceitfully; and he shall become strong with a small people. 
DAN.11.24	Without warning he shall come into the richest parts
DAN.11.25	And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall wage war with an exceedingly great and mighty army; but he shall not stand, for plots shall be devised against him. 
DAN.11.26	Even those who eat his rich food shall be his undoing; his army shall be swept away, and many shall fall down slain. 
DAN.11.27	And as for the two kings, their minds shall be bent on mischief; they shall speak lies at the same table, but to no avail; for the end is yet to be at the time appointed. 
DAN.11.28	And he shall return to his land with great substance, but his heart shall be set against the holy covenant. And he shall work his will, and return to his own land.
DAN.11.29	“At the time appointed he shall return and come into the south; but it shall not be this time as it was before. 
DAN.11.30	For ships of Kittim shall come against him, and he shall be afraid and withdraw, and shall turn back and be enraged and take action against the holy covenant. He shall turn back and give heed to those who forsake the holy covenant. 
DAN.11.31	 Forces from him shall appear and profane the temple and fortress, and shall take away the continual burnt offering. And they shall set up the abomination that makes desolate. 
DAN.11.32	He shall seduce with flattery those who violate the covenant; but the people who know their God shall stand firm and take action. 
DAN.11.33	And those among the people who are wise shall make many understand, though they shall fall by sword and flame, by captivity and plunder, for some days. 
DAN.11.34	When they fall, they shall receive a little help. And many shall join themselves to them with flattery; 
DAN.11.35	and some of those who are wise shall fall, to refine and to cleanse them
DAN.11.37	He shall give no heed to the gods of his fathers, or to the one beloved by women; he shall not give heed to any other god, for he shall magnify himself above all. 
DAN.11.38	He shall honor the god of fortresses instead of these; a god whom his fathers did not know he shall honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts. 
DAN.11.39	He shall deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a foreign god; those who acknowledge him he shall magnify with honor. He shall make them rulers over many and shall divide the land for a price.
DAN.11.40	“At the time of the end the king of the south shall attack
DAN.11.41	He shall come into the glorious land. And tens of thousands shall fall, but these shall be delivered out of his hand: Edom and Moab and the main part of the Ammonites. 
DAN.11.42	He shall stretch out his hand against the countries, and the land of Egypt shall not escape. 
DAN.11.43	He shall become ruler of the treasures of gold and of silver, and all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall follow in his train. 
DAN.11.44	But tidings from the east and the north shall alarm him, and he shall go forth with great fury to exterminate and utterly destroy many. 
DAN.11.45	And he shall pitch his palatial tents between the sea and the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, with none to help him.
DAN.12.2	 And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. 
DAN.12.3	 And those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the firmament; and those who turn many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever. 
DAN.12.4	 But you, Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, until the time of the end. Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase.”
DAN.12.5	Then I Daniel looked, and behold, two others stood, one on this bank of the stream and one on that bank of the stream. 
DAN.12.6	And I
DAN.12.7	 The man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream, raised his right hand and his left hand toward heaven; and I heard him swear by him who lives for ever that it would be for a time, two times, and half a time; and that when the shattering of the power of the holy people comes to an end all these things would be accomplished. 
DAN.12.8	I heard, but I did not understand. Then I said, “O my lord, what shall be the issue of these things?” 
DAN.12.9	He said, “Go your way, Daniel, for the words are shut up and sealed until the time of the end. 
DAN.12.10	Many shall purify themselves, and make themselves white, and be refined; but the wicked shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked shall understand; but those who are wise shall understand. 
DAN.12.11	 And from the time that the continual burnt offering is taken away, and the abomination that makes desolate is set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days. 
DAN.12.12	Blessed is he who waits and comes to the thousand three hundred and thirty-five days. 
DAN.12.13	But go your way till the end; and you shall rest, and shall stand in your allotted place at the end of the days.”
HOS.1.1	The word of the 
HOS.1.2	When the 
HOS.1.3	So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.
HOS.1.4	And the 
HOS.1.5	And on that day, I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.”
HOS.1.7	But I will have pity on the house of Judah, and I will deliver them by the 
HOS.1.8	When she had weaned Not pitied, she conceived and bore a son. 
HOS.1.9	And the 
HOS.1.11	And the people of Judah and the people of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint for themselves one head; and they shall go up from the land, for great shall be the day of Jezreel.
HOS.2.2	“Plead with your mother, plead—
HOS.2.2	for she is not my wife,
HOS.2.2	and I am not her husband—
HOS.2.2	that she put away her harlotry from her face,
HOS.2.2	and her adultery from between her breasts;
HOS.2.3	lest I strip her naked
HOS.2.3	and make her as in the day she was born,
HOS.2.3	and make her like a wilderness,
HOS.2.3	and set her like a parched land,
HOS.2.3	and slay her with thirst.
HOS.2.4	Upon her children also I will have no pity,
HOS.2.4	because they are children of harlotry.
HOS.2.5	For their mother has played the harlot;
HOS.2.5	she that conceived them has acted shamefully.
HOS.2.5	For she said, ‘I will go after my lovers,
HOS.2.5	who give me my bread and my water,
HOS.2.5	my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.’
HOS.2.6	Therefore I will hedge up her
HOS.2.6	and I will build a wall against her,
HOS.2.6	so that she cannot find her paths.
HOS.2.7	She shall pursue her lovers,
HOS.2.7	but not overtake them;
HOS.2.7	and she shall seek them,
HOS.2.7	but shall not find them.
HOS.2.7	Then she shall say, ‘I will go
HOS.2.7	and return to my first husband,
HOS.2.7	for it was better with me then than now.’
HOS.2.8	And she did not know
HOS.2.8	that it was I who gave her
HOS.2.8	the grain, the wine, and the oil,
HOS.2.8	and who lavished upon her silver
HOS.2.8	and gold which they used for Baal.
HOS.2.9	Therefore I will take back
HOS.2.9	my grain in its time,
HOS.2.9	and my wine in its season;
HOS.2.9	and I will take away my wool and my flax,
HOS.2.9	which were to cover her nakedness.
HOS.2.10	Now I will uncover her lewdness
HOS.2.10	in the sight of her lovers,
HOS.2.10	and no one shall rescue her out of my hand.
HOS.2.11	And I will put an end to all her mirth,
HOS.2.11	her feasts, her new moons, her sabbaths,
HOS.2.11	and all her appointed feasts.
HOS.2.12	And I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees,
HOS.2.12	of which she said,
HOS.2.12	‘These are my hire,
HOS.2.12	which my lovers have given me.’
HOS.2.12	I will make them a forest,
HOS.2.12	and the beasts of the field shall devour them.
HOS.2.13	And I will punish her for the feast days of the Baals
HOS.2.13	when she burned incense to them
HOS.2.13	and decked herself with her ring and jewelry,
HOS.2.13	and went after her lovers,
HOS.2.13	and forgot me, says the 
HOS.2.14	“Therefore, behold, I will allure her,
HOS.2.14	and bring her into the wilderness,
HOS.2.14	and speak tenderly to her.
HOS.2.15	And there I will give her her vineyards,
HOS.2.15	and make the Valley of Achor a door of hope.
HOS.2.15	And there she shall answer as in the days of her youth,
HOS.2.15	as at the time when she came out of the land of Egypt.
HOS.2.16	“And in that day, says the 
HOS.2.17	For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth, and they shall be mentioned by name no more. 
HOS.2.18	And I will make for you
HOS.2.19	And I will betroth you to me for ever; I will betroth you to me in righteousness and in justice, in steadfast love, and in mercy. 
HOS.2.20	I will betroth you to me in faithfulness; and you shall know the 
HOS.2.21	“And in that day, says the 
HOS.2.21	I will answer the heavens
HOS.2.21	and they shall answer the earth;
HOS.2.22	and the earth shall answer the grain, the wine, and the oil,
HOS.2.22	and they shall answer Jezreel;
HOS.2.23	and I will sow him
HOS.2.23	And I will have pity on Not pitied,
HOS.2.23	and I will say to Not my people, ‘You are my people’;
HOS.2.23	and he shall say, ‘Thou art my God.’ ”
HOS.3.1	And the 
HOS.3.2	So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer and a lethech of barley. 
HOS.3.3	And I said to her, “You must dwell as mine for many days; you shall not play the harlot, or belong to another man; so will I also be to you.” 
HOS.3.4	For the children of Israel shall dwell many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or pillar, without ephod or teraphim. 
HOS.3.5	Afterward the children of Israel shall return and seek the 
HOS.4.1	Hear the word of the 
HOS.4.1	for the 
HOS.4.1	There is no faithfulness or kindness,
HOS.4.1	and no knowledge of God in the land;
HOS.4.2	there is swearing, lying, killing, stealing, and committing adultery;
HOS.4.2	they break all bounds and murder follows murder.
HOS.4.3	Therefore the land mourns,
HOS.4.3	and all who dwell in it languish,
HOS.4.3	and also the beasts of the field,
HOS.4.3	and the birds of the air;
HOS.4.3	and even the fish of the sea are taken away.
HOS.4.4	Yet let no one contend,
HOS.4.4	and let none accuse,
HOS.4.4	for with you is my contention, O priest.
HOS.4.5	You shall stumble by day,
HOS.4.5	the prophet also shall stumble with you by night;
HOS.4.5	and I will destroy your mother.
HOS.4.6	My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge;
HOS.4.6	because you have rejected knowledge,
HOS.4.6	I reject you from being a priest to me.
HOS.4.6	And since you have forgotten the law of your God,
HOS.4.6	I also will forget your children.
HOS.4.7	The more they increased,
HOS.4.7	the more they sinned against me;
HOS.4.7	I will change their glory into shame.
HOS.4.8	They feed on the sin of my people;
HOS.4.8	they are greedy for their iniquity.
HOS.4.9	And it shall be like people, like priest;
HOS.4.9	I will punish them for their ways,
HOS.4.9	and requite them for their deeds.
HOS.4.10	They shall eat, but not be satisfied;
HOS.4.10	they shall play the harlot, but not multiply;
HOS.4.10	because they have forsaken the 
HOS.4.10	to cherish harlotry.
HOS.4.11	Wine and new wine
HOS.4.11	take away the understanding.
HOS.4.12	My people inquire of a thing of wood,
HOS.4.12	and their staff gives them oracles.
HOS.4.12	For a spirit of harlotry has led them astray,
HOS.4.12	and they have left their God to play the harlot.
HOS.4.13	They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains,
HOS.4.13	and make offerings upon the hills,
HOS.4.13	under oak, poplar, and terebinth,
HOS.4.13	because their shade is good.
HOS.4.13	Therefore your daughters play the harlot,
HOS.4.13	and your brides commit adultery.
HOS.4.14	I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot,
HOS.4.14	nor your brides when they commit adultery;
HOS.4.14	for the men themselves go aside with harlots,
HOS.4.14	and sacrifice with cult prostitutes,
HOS.4.14	and a people without understanding shall come to ruin.
HOS.4.15	Though you play the harlot, O Israel,
HOS.4.15	let not Judah become guilty.
HOS.4.15	Enter not into Gilgal,
HOS.4.15	nor go up to Beth-aven,
HOS.4.15	and swear not, “As the 
HOS.4.16	Like a stubborn heifer,
HOS.4.16	Israel is stubborn;
HOS.4.16	can the 
HOS.4.16	like a lamb in a broad pasture?
HOS.4.17	Ephraim is joined to idols,
HOS.4.17	let him alone.
HOS.4.18	A band
HOS.4.18	they love shame more than their glory.
HOS.4.19	A wind has wrapped them
HOS.4.19	and they shall be ashamed because of their altars.
HOS.5.1	Hear this, O priests!
HOS.5.1	Give heed, O house of Israel!
HOS.5.1	Hearken, O house of the king!
HOS.5.1	For the judgment pertains to you;
HOS.5.1	for you have been a snare at Mizpah,
HOS.5.1	and a net spread upon Tabor.
HOS.5.2	And they have made deep the pit of Shittim;
HOS.5.2	but I will chastise all of them.
HOS.5.3	I know Ephraim,
HOS.5.3	and Israel is not hid from me;
HOS.5.3	for now, O Ephraim, you have played the harlot,
HOS.5.3	Israel is defiled.
HOS.5.4	Their deeds do not permit them
HOS.5.4	to return to their God.
HOS.5.4	For the spirit of harlotry is within them,
HOS.5.4	and they know not the 
HOS.5.5	The pride of Israel testifies to his face;
HOS.5.5	Ephraim 
HOS.5.5	Judah also shall stumble with them.
HOS.5.6	With their flocks and herds they shall go
HOS.5.6	to seek the 
HOS.5.6	but they will not find him;
HOS.5.6	he has withdrawn from them.
HOS.5.7	They have dealt faithlessly with the 
HOS.5.7	for they have borne alien children.
HOS.5.7	Now the new moon shall devour them with their fields.
HOS.5.8	Blow the horn in Gibe-ah,
HOS.5.8	the trumpet in Ramah.
HOS.5.8	Sound the alarm at Beth-aven;
HOS.5.8	tremble,
HOS.5.9	Ephraim shall become a desolation
HOS.5.9	in the day of punishment;
HOS.5.9	among the tribes of Israel
HOS.5.9	I declare what is sure.
HOS.5.10	The princes of Judah have become
HOS.5.10	like those who remove the landmark;
HOS.5.10	upon them I will pour out
HOS.5.10	my wrath like water.
HOS.5.11	Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment,
HOS.5.11	because he was determined to go after vanity.
HOS.5.12	Therefore I am like a moth to Ephraim,
HOS.5.12	and like dry rot to the house of Judah.
HOS.5.13	When Ephraim saw his sickness,
HOS.5.13	and Judah his wound,
HOS.5.13	then Ephraim went to Assyria,
HOS.5.13	and sent to the great king.
HOS.5.13	But he is not able to cure you
HOS.5.13	or heal your wound.
HOS.5.14	For I will be like a lion to Ephraim,
HOS.5.14	and like a young lion to the house of Judah.
HOS.5.14	I, even I, will rend and go away,
HOS.5.14	I will carry off, and none shall rescue.
HOS.5.15	I will return again to my place,
HOS.5.15	until they acknowledge their guilt and seek my face,
HOS.5.15	and in their distress they seek me, saying,
HOS.6.1	“Come, let us return to the 
HOS.6.1	for he has torn, that he may heal us;
HOS.6.1	he has stricken, and he will bind us up.
HOS.6.2	After two days he will revive us;
HOS.6.2	on the third day he will raise us up,
HOS.6.2	that we may live before him.
HOS.6.3	Let us know, let us press on to know the 
HOS.6.3	his going forth is sure as the dawn;
HOS.6.3	he will come to us as the showers,
HOS.6.3	as the spring rains that water the earth.”
HOS.6.4	What shall I do with you, O Ephraim?
HOS.6.4	What shall I do with you, O Judah?
HOS.6.4	Your love is like a morning cloud,
HOS.6.4	like the dew that goes early away.
HOS.6.5	Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets,
HOS.6.5	I have slain them by the words of my mouth,
HOS.6.5	and my judgment goes forth as the light.
HOS.6.6	the knowledge of God, rather than burnt offerings.
HOS.6.7	But at
HOS.6.7	there they dealt faithlessly with me.
HOS.6.8	Gilead is a city of evildoers,
HOS.6.8	tracked with blood.
HOS.6.9	As robbers lie in wait
HOS.6.9	so the priests are banded together;
HOS.6.9	they murder on the way to Shechem,
HOS.6.9	yea, they commit villainy.
HOS.6.10	In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing;
HOS.6.10	Ephraim's harlotry is there, Israel is defiled.
HOS.6.11	For you also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed.
HOS.6.11	When I would restore the fortunes of my people,
HOS.7.1	when I would heal Israel,
HOS.7.1	the corruption of Ephraim is revealed,
HOS.7.1	and the wicked deeds of Samaria;
HOS.7.1	for they deal falsely,
HOS.7.1	the thief breaks in,
HOS.7.1	and the bandits raid without.
HOS.7.2	But they do not consider
HOS.7.2	that I remember all their evil works.
HOS.7.2	Now their deeds encompass them,
HOS.7.2	they are before my face.
HOS.7.3	By their wickedness they make the king glad,
HOS.7.3	and the princes by their treachery.
HOS.7.4	They are all adulterers;
HOS.7.4	they are like a heated oven,
HOS.7.4	whose baker ceases to stir the fire,
HOS.7.4	from the kneading of the dough until it is leavened.
HOS.7.5	On the day of our king the princes
HOS.7.5	became sick with the heat of wine;
HOS.7.5	he stretched out his hand with mockers.
HOS.7.6	For like an oven their hearts burn
HOS.7.6	all night their anger smolders;
HOS.7.6	in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.
HOS.7.7	All of them are hot as an oven,
HOS.7.7	and they devour their rulers.
HOS.7.7	All their kings have fallen;
HOS.7.7	and none of them calls upon me.
HOS.7.8	Ephraim mixes himself with the peoples;
HOS.7.8	Ephraim is a cake not turned.
HOS.7.9	Aliens devour his strength,
HOS.7.9	and he knows it not;
HOS.7.9	gray hairs are sprinkled upon him,
HOS.7.9	and he knows it not.
HOS.7.10	The pride of Israel witnesses against him;
HOS.7.10	yet they do not return to the 
HOS.7.10	nor seek him, for all this.
HOS.7.11	Ephraim is like a dove,
HOS.7.11	silly and without sense,
HOS.7.11	calling to Egypt, going to Assyria.
HOS.7.12	As they go, I will spread over them my net;
HOS.7.12	I will bring them down like birds of the air;
HOS.7.12	I will chastise them for their wicked deeds.
HOS.7.13	Woe to them, for they have strayed from me!
HOS.7.13	Destruction to them, for they have rebelled against me!
HOS.7.13	I would redeem them,
HOS.7.13	but they speak lies against me.
HOS.7.14	They do not cry to me from the heart,
HOS.7.14	but they wail upon their beds;
HOS.7.14	for grain and wine they gash themselves,
HOS.7.14	they rebel against me.
HOS.7.15	Although I trained and strengthened their arms,
HOS.7.15	yet they devise evil against me.
HOS.7.16	They turn to Baal;
HOS.7.16	they are like a treacherous bow,
HOS.7.16	their princes shall fall by the sword
HOS.7.16	because of the insolence of their tongue.
HOS.7.16	This shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.
HOS.8.1	Set the trumpet to your lips,
HOS.8.1	for
HOS.8.1	because they have broken my covenant,
HOS.8.1	and transgressed my law.
HOS.8.2	To me they cry,
HOS.8.2	My God, we Israel know thee.
HOS.8.3	Israel has spurned the good;
HOS.8.3	the enemy shall pursue him.
HOS.8.4	They made kings, but not through me.
HOS.8.4	They set up princes, but without my knowledge.
HOS.8.4	With their silver and gold they made idols
HOS.8.4	for their own destruction.
HOS.8.5	I have
HOS.8.5	My anger burns against them.
HOS.8.5	How long will it be
HOS.8.5	till they are pure
HOS.8.6	in Israel?
HOS.8.6	A workman made it;
HOS.8.6	it is not God.
HOS.8.6	The calf of Samaria
HOS.8.6	shall be broken to pieces.
HOS.8.7	For they sow the wind,
HOS.8.7	and they shall reap the whirlwind.
HOS.8.7	The standing grain has no heads,
HOS.8.7	it shall yield no meal;
HOS.8.7	if it were to yield,
HOS.8.7	aliens would devour it.
HOS.8.8	Israel is swallowed up;
HOS.8.8	already they are among the nations
HOS.8.8	as a useless vessel.
HOS.8.9	For they have gone up to Assyria,
HOS.8.9	a wild ass wandering alone;
HOS.8.9	Ephraim has hired lovers.
HOS.8.10	Though they hire allies among the nations,
HOS.8.10	I will soon gather them up.
HOS.8.10	And they shall cease
HOS.8.10	from anointing
HOS.8.11	Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning,
HOS.8.11	they have become to him altars for sinning.
HOS.8.12	Were I to write for him my laws by ten thousands,
HOS.8.12	they would be regarded as a strange thing.
HOS.8.13	They love sacrifice;
HOS.8.13	they sacrifice flesh and eat it;
HOS.8.13	but the 
HOS.8.13	Now he will remember their iniquity,
HOS.8.13	and punish their sins;
HOS.8.13	they shall return to Egypt.
HOS.8.14	and built palaces;
HOS.8.14	and Judah has multiplied fortified cities;
HOS.8.14	but I will send a fire upon his cities,
HOS.8.14	and it shall devour his strongholds.
HOS.9.1	Rejoice not, O Israel!
HOS.9.1	Exult not
HOS.9.1	for you have played the harlot, forsaking your God.
HOS.9.1	You have loved a harlot's hire
HOS.9.1	upon all threshing floors.
HOS.9.2	Threshing floor and winevat shall not feed them,
HOS.9.2	and the new wine shall fail them.
HOS.9.3	They shall not remain in the land of the 
HOS.9.3	but Ephraim shall return to Egypt,
HOS.9.3	and they shall eat unclean food in Assyria.
HOS.9.4	They shall not pour libations of wine to the 
HOS.9.4	and they shall not please him with their sacrifices.
HOS.9.4	Their bread
HOS.9.4	all who eat of it shall be defiled;
HOS.9.4	for their bread shall be for their hunger only;
HOS.9.4	it shall not come to the house of the 
HOS.9.5	What will you do on the day of appointed festival,
HOS.9.5	and on the day of the feast of the 
HOS.9.6	For behold, they are going to Assyria;
HOS.9.6	Egypt shall gather them,
HOS.9.6	Memphis shall bury them.
HOS.9.6	Nettles shall possess their precious things of silver;
HOS.9.6	thorns shall be in their tents.
HOS.9.7	the days of recompense have come;
HOS.9.7	Israel shall know it.
HOS.9.7	The prophet is a fool,
HOS.9.7	the man of the spirit is mad,
HOS.9.7	because of your great iniquity
HOS.9.7	and great hatred.
HOS.9.8	The prophet is the watchman of Ephraim,
HOS.9.8	the people of my God,
HOS.9.8	yet a fowler's snare is on all his ways,
HOS.9.8	and hatred in the house of his God.
HOS.9.9	They have deeply corrupted themselves
HOS.9.9	as in the days of Gibe-ah:
HOS.9.9	he will remember their iniquity,
HOS.9.9	he will punish their sins.
HOS.9.10	Like grapes in the wilderness,
HOS.9.10	I found Israel.
HOS.9.10	Like the first fruit on the fig tree,
HOS.9.10	in its first season,
HOS.9.10	I saw your fathers.
HOS.9.10	But they came to Baal-peor,
HOS.9.10	and consecrated themselves to Baal,
HOS.9.10	and became detestable like the thing they loved.
HOS.9.11	Ephraim's glory shall fly away like a bird—
HOS.9.11	no birth, no pregnancy, no conception!
HOS.9.12	Even if they bring up children,
HOS.9.12	I will bereave them till none is left.
HOS.9.12	Woe to them
HOS.9.12	when I depart from them!
HOS.9.13	Ephraim's sons, as I have seen, are destined for a prey;
HOS.9.13	Ephraim must lead forth his sons to slaughter.
HOS.9.14	Give them, O 
HOS.9.14	what wilt thou give?
HOS.9.14	Give them a miscarrying womb
HOS.9.14	and dry breasts.
HOS.9.15	Every evil of theirs is in Gilgal;
HOS.9.15	there I began to hate them.
HOS.9.15	Because of the wickedness of their deeds
HOS.9.15	I will drive them out of my house.
HOS.9.15	I will love them no more;
HOS.9.15	all their princes are rebels.
HOS.9.16	Ephraim is stricken,
HOS.9.16	their root is dried up,
HOS.9.16	they shall bear no fruit.
HOS.9.16	Even though they bring forth,
HOS.9.16	I will slay their beloved children.
HOS.9.17	My God will cast them off,
HOS.9.17	because they have not hearkened to him;
HOS.9.17	they shall be wanderers among the nations.
HOS.10.1	Israel is a luxuriant vine
HOS.10.1	that yields its fruit.
HOS.10.1	The more his fruit increased
HOS.10.1	the more altars he built;
HOS.10.1	as his country improved
HOS.10.1	he improved his pillars.
HOS.10.2	Their heart is false;
HOS.10.2	now they must bear their guilt.
HOS.10.2	The 
HOS.10.2	and destroy their pillars.
HOS.10.3	For now they will say:
HOS.10.3	“We have no king,
HOS.10.3	for we fear not the 
HOS.10.3	and a king, what could he do for us?”
HOS.10.4	They utter mere words;
HOS.10.4	with empty oaths they make covenants;
HOS.10.4	so judgment springs up like poisonous weeds
HOS.10.4	in the furrows of the field.
HOS.10.5	The inhabitants of Samaria tremble
HOS.10.5	for the calf
HOS.10.5	Its people shall mourn for it,
HOS.10.5	and its idolatrous priests shall wail
HOS.10.5	over its glory which has departed from it.
HOS.10.6	Yea, the thing itself shall be carried to Assyria,
HOS.10.6	as tribute to the great king.
HOS.10.6	Ephraim shall be put to shame,
HOS.10.6	and Israel shall be ashamed of his idol.
HOS.10.7	Samaria's king shall perish,
HOS.10.7	like a chip on the face of the waters.
HOS.10.8	shall be destroyed.
HOS.10.8	Thorn and thistle shall grow up
HOS.10.8	on their altars;
HOS.10.8	and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us,
HOS.10.8	and to the hills, Fall upon us.
HOS.10.9	From the days of Gibe-ah, you have sinned, O Israel;
HOS.10.9	there they have continued.
HOS.10.9	Shall not war overtake them in Gibe-ah?
HOS.10.10	I will come
HOS.10.10	and nations shall be gathered against them
HOS.10.10	when they are chastised
HOS.10.11	Ephraim was a trained heifer
HOS.10.11	that loved to thresh,
HOS.10.11	and I spared her fair neck;
HOS.10.11	but I will put Ephraim to the yoke,
HOS.10.11	Judah must plow,
HOS.10.11	Jacob must harrow for himself.
HOS.10.12	reap the fruit
HOS.10.12	break up your fallow ground,
HOS.10.12	for it is the time to seek the 
HOS.10.12	that he may come and rain salvation upon you.
HOS.10.13	You have plowed iniquity,
HOS.10.13	you have reaped injustice,
HOS.10.13	you have eaten the fruit of lies.
HOS.10.13	Because you have trusted in your chariots
HOS.10.13	and in the multitude of your warriors,
HOS.10.14	therefore the tumult of war shall arise among your people,
HOS.10.14	and all your fortresses shall be destroyed,
HOS.10.14	as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel on the day of battle;
HOS.10.14	mothers were dashed in pieces with their children.
HOS.10.15	Thus it shall be done to you, O house of Israel,
HOS.10.15	because of your great wickedness.
HOS.10.15	In the storm
HOS.10.15	shall be utterly cut off.
HOS.11.1	and out of Egypt I called my son.
HOS.11.2	The more I
HOS.11.2	the more they went from me;
HOS.11.2	they kept sacrificing to the Baals,
HOS.11.2	and burning incense to idols.
HOS.11.3	Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk,
HOS.11.3	I took them up in my
HOS.11.3	but they did not know that I healed them.
HOS.11.4	I led them with cords of compassion,
HOS.11.4	with the bands of love,
HOS.11.4	and I became to them as one
HOS.11.4	who eases the yoke on their jaws,
HOS.11.4	and I bent down to them and fed them.
HOS.11.5	They shall return to the land of Egypt,
HOS.11.5	and Assyria shall be their king,
HOS.11.5	because they have refused to return to me.
HOS.11.6	The sword shall rage against their cities,
HOS.11.6	consume the bars of their gates,
HOS.11.6	and devour them in their fortresses.
HOS.11.7	My people are bent on turning away from me;
HOS.11.7	so they are appointed to the yoke,
HOS.11.7	and none shall remove it.
HOS.11.8	How can I give you up, O Ephraim!
HOS.11.8	How can I hand you over, O Israel!
HOS.11.8	How can I make you like Admah!
HOS.11.8	How can I treat you like Zeboiim!
HOS.11.8	My heart recoils within me,
HOS.11.8	my compassion grows warm and tender.
HOS.11.9	I will not execute my fierce anger,
HOS.11.9	I will not again destroy Ephraim;
HOS.11.9	for I am God and not man,
HOS.11.9	the Holy One in your midst,
HOS.11.9	and I will not come to destroy.
HOS.11.10	They shall go after the 
HOS.11.10	he will roar like a lion;
HOS.11.10	yea, he will roar,
HOS.11.10	and his sons shall come trembling from the west;
HOS.11.11	they shall come trembling like birds from Egypt,
HOS.11.11	and like doves from the land of Assyria;
HOS.11.11	and I will return them to their homes, says the 
HOS.11.12	and the house of Israel with deceit;
HOS.11.12	but Judah is still known by
HOS.11.12	and is faithful to the Holy One.
HOS.12.1	Ephraim herds the wind,
HOS.12.1	and pursues the east wind all day long;
HOS.12.1	they multiply falsehood and violence;
HOS.12.1	they make a bargain with Assyria,
HOS.12.1	and oil is carried to Egypt.
HOS.12.2	The 
HOS.12.2	and will punish Jacob according to his ways,
HOS.12.2	and requite him according to his deeds.
HOS.12.3	In the womb he took his brother by the heel,
HOS.12.3	and in his manhood he strove with God.
HOS.12.4	He strove with the angel and prevailed,
HOS.12.4	he wept and sought his favor.
HOS.12.4	He met God at Bethel,
HOS.12.4	and there God spoke with him
HOS.12.5	the 
HOS.12.5	the 
HOS.12.6	“So you, by the help of your God, return,
HOS.12.6	hold fast to love and justice,
HOS.12.6	and wait continually for your God.”
HOS.12.7	A trader, in whose hands are false balances,
HOS.12.7	he loves to oppress.
HOS.12.8	I have gained wealth for myself”;
HOS.12.8	but all his riches can never offset
HOS.12.8	the guilt he has incurred.
HOS.12.9	I am the 
HOS.12.9	from the land of Egypt;
HOS.12.9	I will again make you dwell in tents,
HOS.12.9	as in the days of the appointed feast.
HOS.12.10	I spoke to the prophets;
HOS.12.10	it was I who multiplied visions,
HOS.12.10	and through the prophets gave parables.
HOS.12.11	If there is iniquity in Gilead
HOS.12.11	they shall surely come to naught;
HOS.12.11	if in Gilgal they sacrifice bulls,
HOS.12.11	their altars also shall be like stone heaps
HOS.12.11	on the furrows of the field.
HOS.12.12	(Jacob fled to the land of Aram,
HOS.12.12	there Israel did service for a wife,
HOS.12.12	and for a wife he herded sheep.)
HOS.12.13	By a prophet the 
HOS.12.13	and by a prophet he was preserved.
HOS.12.14	Ephraim has given bitter provocation;
HOS.12.14	so his 
HOS.12.14	and will turn back upon him his reproaches.
HOS.13.1	When Ephraim spoke, men trembled;
HOS.13.1	he was exalted in Israel;
HOS.13.1	but he incurred guilt through Baal and died.
HOS.13.2	And now they sin more and more,
HOS.13.2	and make for themselves molten images,
HOS.13.2	idols skilfully made of their silver,
HOS.13.2	all of them the work of craftsmen.
HOS.13.2	Sacrifice to these, they say.
HOS.13.2	Men kiss calves!
HOS.13.3	Therefore they shall be like the morning mist
HOS.13.3	or like the dew that goes early away,
HOS.13.3	like the chaff that swirls from the threshing floor
HOS.13.3	or like smoke from a window.
HOS.13.4	I am the 
HOS.13.4	from the land of Egypt;
HOS.13.4	you know no God but me,
HOS.13.4	and besides me there is no saviour.
HOS.13.5	It was I who knew you in the wilderness,
HOS.13.5	in the land of drought;
HOS.13.6	but when they had fed
HOS.13.6	they were filled, and their heart was lifted up;
HOS.13.6	therefore they forgot me.
HOS.13.7	So I will be to them like a lion,
HOS.13.7	like a leopard I will lurk beside the way.
HOS.13.8	I will fall upon them like a bear robbed of her cubs,
HOS.13.8	I will tear open their breast,
HOS.13.8	and there I will devour them like a lion,
HOS.13.8	as a wild beast would rend them.
HOS.13.9	I will destroy you, O Israel;
HOS.13.9	who
HOS.13.10	Where
HOS.13.10	where are all
HOS.13.10	those of whom you said,
HOS.13.10	“Give me a king and princes”?
HOS.13.11	I have given you kings in my anger,
HOS.13.11	and I have taken them away in my wrath.
HOS.13.12	The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up,
HOS.13.12	his sin is kept in store.
HOS.13.13	The pangs of childbirth come for him,
HOS.13.13	but he is an unwise son;
HOS.13.13	for now he does not present himself
HOS.13.13	at the mouth of the womb.
HOS.13.14	Shall I redeem them from Death?
HOS.13.14	O Death, where
HOS.13.14	O Sheol, where
HOS.13.14	Compassion is hid from my eyes.
HOS.13.15	Though he may flourish as the reed plant,
HOS.13.15	the east wind, the wind of the 
HOS.13.15	rising from the wilderness;
HOS.13.15	and his fountain shall dry up,
HOS.13.15	his spring shall be parched;
HOS.13.15	it shall strip his treasury
HOS.13.15	of every precious thing.
HOS.13.16	because she has rebelled against her God;
HOS.13.16	they shall fall by the sword,
HOS.13.16	their little ones shall be dashed in pieces,
HOS.13.16	and their pregnant women ripped open.
HOS.14.1	Return, O Israel, to the 
HOS.14.1	for you have stumbled because of your iniquity.
HOS.14.2	and return to the 
HOS.14.2	say to him,
HOS.14.2	“Take away all iniquity;
HOS.14.2	accept that which is good
HOS.14.2	and we will render
HOS.14.2	the fruit
HOS.14.3	Assyria shall not save us,
HOS.14.3	we will not ride upon horses;
HOS.14.3	and we will say no more, ‘Our God,’
HOS.14.3	to the work of our hands.
HOS.14.3	In thee the orphan finds mercy.”
HOS.14.4	I will heal their faithlessness;
HOS.14.4	I will love them freely,
HOS.14.4	for my anger has turned from them.

JOL.1.5	because of the sweet wine,
JOL.1.5	for it is cut off from your mouth.
JOL.1.6	powerful and without number;

JOL.2.4	and like war horses they run.
JOL.2.5	As with the rumbling of chariots,
JOL.2.5	they leap on the tops of the mountains,
JOL.2.5	like the crackling of a flame of fire
JOL.2.5	devouring the stubble,
JOL.2.5	like a powerful army
JOL.2.5	drawn up for battle.
JOL.2.6	Before them peoples are in anguish,
JOL.2.6	all faces grow pale.
JOL.2.7	Like warriors they charge,
JOL.2.7	like soldiers they scale the wall.
JOL.2.7	They march each on his way,
JOL.2.7	they do not swerve
JOL.2.8	They do not jostle one another,
JOL.2.8	each marches in his path;
JOL.2.8	they burst through the weapons
JOL.2.8	and are not halted.
JOL.2.9	They leap upon the city,
JOL.2.9	they run upon the walls;
JOL.2.9	they climb up into the houses,

AMO.1.4	and it shall devour the strongholds of Ben-hadad.
AMO.1.5	I will break the bar of Damascus,
AMO.1.5	and cut off the inhabitants from the Valley of Aven,

AMO.1.7	and it shall devour her strongholds.
AMO.1.8	I will cut off the inhabitants from Ashdod,

AMO.4.7	one field would be rained upon,
AMO.4.7	and the field on which it did not rain withered;
AMO.4.8	so two or three cities wandered to one city
AMO.4.8	to drink water, and were not satisfied;
AMO.4.8	yet you did not return to me,”
AMO.4.8	says the 
AMO.4.9	“I smote you with blight and mildew;
AMO.4.9	I laid waste
AMO.4.9	your fig trees and your olive trees the locust devoured;
AMO.4.9	yet you did not return to me,”
AMO.4.9	says the 
AMO.4.10	“I sent among you a pestilence after the manner of Egypt;
AMO.4.10	I slew your young men with the sword;
AMO.4.10	I carried away your horses;
AMO.4.10	and I made the stench of your camp go up into your nostrils;
AMO.4.10	yet you did not return to me,”
AMO.4.10	says the 
AMO.4.11	“I overthrew some of you,
AMO.4.11	as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah,
AMO.4.11	and you were as a brand plucked out of the burning;
AMO.4.11	yet you did not return to me,”
AMO.4.11	says the 
AMO.4.12	“Therefore thus I will do to you, O Israel;
AMO.4.12	because I will do this to you,
AMO.4.12	prepare to meet your God, O Israel!”
AMO.4.13	For lo, he who forms the mountains, and creates the wind,
AMO.4.13	and declares to man what is his thought;
AMO.4.13	who makes the morning darkness,
AMO.4.13	and treads on the heights of the earth—
AMO.4.13	the 
AMO.5.1	Hear this word which I take up over you in lamentation, O house of Israel:
AMO.5.2	“Fallen, no more to rise,
AMO.5.2	is the virgin Israel;
AMO.5.2	forsaken on her land,
AMO.5.2	with none to raise her up.”
AMO.5.3	For thus says the Lord 
AMO.5.3	“The city that went forth a thousand
AMO.5.3	shall have a hundred left,
AMO.5.3	and that which went forth a hundred
AMO.5.3	shall have ten left
AMO.5.3	to the house of Israel.”
AMO.5.4	For thus says the 
AMO.5.4	“Seek me and live;
AMO.5.5	but do not seek Bethel,
AMO.5.5	and do not enter into Gilgal
AMO.5.5	or cross over to Beer-sheba;
AMO.5.5	for Gilgal shall surely go into exile,
AMO.5.5	and Bethel shall come to naught.”
AMO.5.6	Seek the 
AMO.5.6	lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph,
AMO.5.6	and it devour, with none to quench it for Bethel,
AMO.5.7	O you who turn justice to wormwood,
AMO.5.7	and cast down righteousness to the earth!
AMO.5.8	He who made the Pleiades and Orion,
AMO.5.8	and turns deep darkness into the morning,
AMO.5.8	and darkens the day into night,
AMO.5.8	who calls for the waters of the sea,
AMO.5.8	and pours them out upon the surface of the earth,
AMO.5.8	the 
AMO.5.9	who makes destruction flash forth against the strong,
AMO.5.9	so that destruction comes upon the fortress.
AMO.5.10	They hate him who reproves in the gate,
AMO.5.10	and they abhor him who speaks the truth.
AMO.5.11	Therefore because you trample upon the poor
AMO.5.11	and take from him exactions of wheat,
AMO.5.11	you have built houses of hewn stone,
AMO.5.11	but you shall not dwell in them;
AMO.5.11	you have planted pleasant vineyards,
AMO.5.11	but you shall not drink their wine.
AMO.5.12	For I know how many are your transgressions,
AMO.5.12	and how great are your sins—
AMO.5.12	you who afflict the righteous, who take a bribe,
AMO.5.12	and turn aside the needy in the gate.
AMO.5.13	Therefore he who is prudent will keep silent in such a time;
AMO.5.13	for it is an evil time.
AMO.5.14	Seek good, and not evil,
AMO.5.14	that you may live;
AMO.5.14	and so the 
AMO.5.14	as you have said.
AMO.5.15	Hate evil, and love good,
AMO.5.15	and establish justice in the gate;
AMO.5.15	it may be that the 
AMO.5.15	will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.
AMO.5.16	Therefore thus says the 
AMO.5.16	“In all the squares there shall be wailing;
AMO.5.16	and in all the streets they shall say, ‘Alas! alas!’
AMO.5.16	They shall call the farmers to mourning
AMO.5.16	and to wailing those who are skilled in lamentation,
AMO.5.17	and in all vineyards there shall be wailing,
AMO.5.17	for I will pass through the midst of you,”
AMO.5.17	says the 
AMO.5.18	Woe to you who desire the day of the 
AMO.5.18	Why would you have the day of the 
AMO.5.18	It is darkness, and not light;
AMO.5.19	as if a man fled from a lion,
AMO.5.19	and a bear met him;
AMO.5.19	or went into the house and leaned with his hand against the wall,
AMO.5.19	and a serpent bit him.
AMO.5.20	Is not the day of the 
AMO.5.20	and gloom with no brightness in it?
AMO.5.21	“I hate, I despise your feasts,
AMO.5.21	and I take no delight in your solemn assemblies.
AMO.5.22	Even though you offer me your burnt offerings and cereal offerings,
AMO.5.22	I will not accept them,
AMO.5.22	and the peace offerings of your fatted beasts
AMO.5.22	I will not look upon.
AMO.5.23	Take away from me the noise of your songs;
AMO.5.23	to the melody of your harps I will not listen.
AMO.5.24	But let justice roll down like waters,
AMO.5.24	and righteousness like an everflowing stream.
AMO.5.26	You shall take up Sakkuth your king, and Kaiwan your star-god, your images,
AMO.5.27	therefore I will take you into exile beyond Damascus,” says the 
AMO.6.1	“Woe to those who are at ease in Zion,
AMO.6.1	and to those who feel secure on the mountain of Samaria,
AMO.6.1	the notable men of the first of the nations,
AMO.6.1	to whom the house of Israel come!
AMO.6.2	Pass over to Calneh, and see;
AMO.6.2	and thence go to Hamath the great;
AMO.6.2	then go down to Gath of the Philistines.
AMO.6.2	Are they better than these kingdoms?
AMO.6.2	Or is their territory greater than your territory,
AMO.6.3	O you who put far away the evil day,
AMO.6.3	and bring near the seat of violence?
AMO.6.4	“Woe to those who lie upon beds of ivory,
AMO.6.4	and stretch themselves upon their couches,
AMO.6.4	and eat lambs from the flock,
AMO.6.4	and calves from the midst of the stall;
AMO.6.5	who sing idle songs to the sound of the harp,
AMO.6.5	and like David invent for themselves instruments of music;
AMO.6.6	who drink wine in bowls,
AMO.6.6	and anoint themselves with the finest oils,
AMO.6.6	but are not grieved over the ruin of Joseph!
AMO.6.7	Therefore they shall now be the first of those to go into exile,
AMO.6.7	and the revelry of those who stretch themselves shall pass away.”
AMO.6.8	The Lord 
AMO.6.8	(says the 
AMO.6.8	“I abhor the pride of Jacob,
AMO.6.8	and hate his strongholds;
AMO.6.8	and I will deliver up the city and all that is in it.”
AMO.6.9	And if ten men remain in one house, they shall die. 
AMO.6.10	And when a man's kinsman, he who burns him,
AMO.6.11	For behold, the 
AMO.6.11	and the great house shall be smitten into fragments,
AMO.6.11	and the little house into bits.
AMO.6.12	Do horses run upon rocks?
AMO.6.12	Does one plow the sea with oxen?
AMO.6.12	But you have turned justice into poison
AMO.6.12	and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood—
AMO.6.13	you who rejoice in Lo-debar,
AMO.6.13	who say, “Have we not by our own strength
AMO.6.13	taken Karnaim
AMO.6.14	“For behold, I will raise up against you a nation,
AMO.6.14	O house of Israel,” says the 
AMO.6.14	“and they shall oppress you from the entrance of Hamath
AMO.6.14	to the Brook of the Arabah.”
AMO.7.1	Thus the Lord 
AMO.7.2	When they had finished eating the grass of the land, I said,
AMO.7.2	“O Lord 
AMO.7.2	How can Jacob stand?
AMO.7.2	He is so small!”
AMO.7.3	The 
AMO.7.3	“It shall not be,” said the 
AMO.7.4	Thus the Lord 
AMO.7.5	Then I said,
AMO.7.5	“O Lord 
AMO.7.5	How can Jacob stand?
AMO.7.5	He is so small!”
AMO.7.6	The 
AMO.7.6	“This also shall not be,” said the Lord 
AMO.7.7	He showed me: behold, the Lord was standing beside a wall built with a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand. 
AMO.7.8	And the 
AMO.7.8	“Behold, I am setting a plumb line
AMO.7.8	in the midst of my people Israel;
AMO.7.8	I will never again pass by them;
AMO.7.9	the high places of Isaac shall be made desolate,
AMO.7.9	and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste,
AMO.7.9	and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.”
AMO.7.10	Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, “Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his words. 
AMO.7.11	For thus Amos has said,
AMO.7.11	‘Jeroboam shall die by the sword,
AMO.7.11	and Israel must go into exile
AMO.7.11	away from his land.’ ”
AMO.7.12	And Amaziah said to Amos, “O seer, go, flee away to the land of Judah, and eat bread there, and prophesy there; 
AMO.7.13	but never again prophesy at Bethel, for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a temple of the kingdom.”
AMO.7.14	Then Amos answered Amaziah, “I am no prophet, nor a prophet's son;
AMO.7.15	and the 
AMO.7.16	“Now therefore hear the word of the 
AMO.7.16	You say, ‘Do not prophesy against Israel,
AMO.7.16	and do not preach against the house of Isaac.’
AMO.7.17	Therefore thus says the 
AMO.7.17	‘Your wife shall be a harlot in the city,
AMO.7.17	and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword,
AMO.7.17	and your land shall be parceled out by line;
AMO.7.17	you yourself shall die in an unclean land,
AMO.7.17	and Israel shall surely go into exile away from its land.’ ”
AMO.8.1	Thus the Lord 
AMO.8.2	And he said, “Amos, what do you see?” And I said, “A basket of summer fruit.”
AMO.8.2	“The end
AMO.8.2	I will never again pass by them.
AMO.8.3	The songs of the temple
AMO.8.3	says the Lord 
AMO.8.3	“the dead bodies shall be many;
AMO.8.3	in every place they shall be cast out in silence.”
AMO.8.4	Hear this, you who trample upon the needy,
AMO.8.4	and bring the poor of the land to an end,
AMO.8.5	saying, “When will the new moon be over,
AMO.8.5	that we may sell grain?
AMO.8.5	And the sabbath,
AMO.8.5	that we may offer wheat for sale,
AMO.8.5	that we may make the ephah small and the shekel great,
AMO.8.5	and deal deceitfully with false balances,
AMO.8.6	that we may buy the poor for silver
AMO.8.6	and the needy for a pair of sandals,
AMO.8.6	and sell the refuse of the wheat?”
AMO.8.7	The 
AMO.8.7	“Surely I will never forget any of their deeds.
AMO.8.8	Shall not the land tremble on this account,
AMO.8.8	and every one mourn who dwells in it,
AMO.8.8	and all of it rise like the Nile,
AMO.8.8	and be tossed about and sink again, like the Nile of Egypt?”
AMO.8.9	“And on that day,” says the Lord 
AMO.8.9	“I will make the sun go down at noon,
AMO.8.9	and darken the earth in broad daylight.
AMO.8.10	I will turn your feasts into mourning,
AMO.8.10	and all your songs into lamentation;
AMO.8.10	I will bring sackcloth upon all loins,
AMO.8.10	and baldness on every head;
AMO.8.10	I will make it like the mourning for an only son,
AMO.8.10	and the end of it like a bitter day.
AMO.8.11	“Behold, the days are coming,” says the Lord 
AMO.8.11	“when I will send a famine on the land;
AMO.8.11	not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water,
AMO.8.11	but of hearing the words of the 
AMO.8.12	They shall wander from sea to sea,
AMO.8.12	and from north to east;
AMO.8.12	they shall run to and fro, to seek the word of the 
AMO.8.12	but they shall not find it.
AMO.8.13	“In that day the fair virgins and the young men
AMO.8.13	shall faint for thirst.
AMO.8.14	Those who swear by Ashimah of Samaria,
AMO.8.14	and say, ‘As thy god lives, O Dan,’
AMO.8.14	and, ‘As the way of Beer-sheba lives,’
AMO.8.14	they shall fall, and never rise again.”
AMO.9.1	I saw the 
AMO.9.1	“Smite the capitals until the thresholds shake,
AMO.9.1	and shatter them on the heads of all the people;
AMO.9.1	and what are left of them I will slay with the sword;
AMO.9.1	not one of them shall flee away,
AMO.9.1	not one of them shall escape.
AMO.9.2	“Though they dig into Sheol,
AMO.9.2	from there shall my hand take them;
AMO.9.2	though they climb up to heaven,
AMO.9.2	from there I will bring them down.
AMO.9.3	Though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel,
AMO.9.3	from there I will search out and take them;
AMO.9.3	and though they hide from my sight at the bottom of the sea,
AMO.9.3	there I will command the serpent, and it shall bite them.
AMO.9.4	And though they go into captivity before their enemies,
AMO.9.4	there I will command the sword, and it shall slay them;
AMO.9.4	and I will set my eyes upon them
AMO.9.4	for evil and not for good.”
AMO.9.5	The Lord, 
AMO.9.5	he who touches the earth and it melts,
AMO.9.5	and all who dwell in it mourn,
AMO.9.5	and all of it rises like the Nile,
AMO.9.5	and sinks again, like the Nile of Egypt;
AMO.9.6	who builds his upper chambers in the heavens,
AMO.9.6	and founds his vault upon the earth;
AMO.9.6	who calls for the waters of the sea,
AMO.9.6	and pours them out upon the surface of the earth—
AMO.9.6	the 
AMO.9.7	“Are you not like the Ethiopians to me,
AMO.9.7	O people of Israel?” says the 
AMO.9.7	“Did I not bring up Israel from the land of Egypt,
AMO.9.7	and the Philistines from Caphtor and the Syrians from Kir?
AMO.9.8	Behold, the eyes of the Lord 
AMO.9.8	and I will destroy it from the surface of the ground;
AMO.9.8	except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,”
AMO.9.8	says the 
AMO.9.9	“For lo, I will command,
AMO.9.9	and shake the house of Israel among all the nations
AMO.9.9	as one shakes with a sieve,
AMO.9.9	but no pebble shall fall upon the earth.
AMO.9.10	All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword,
AMO.9.10	who say, ‘Evil shall not overtake or meet us.’
AMO.9.11	the booth of David that is fallen
AMO.9.11	and repair its breaches,
AMO.9.11	and raise up its ruins,
AMO.9.11	and rebuild it as in the days of old;
AMO.9.12	that they may possess the remnant of Edom
AMO.9.12	and all the nations who are called by my name,”
AMO.9.12	says the 
AMO.9.13	“when the plowman shall overtake the reaper
AMO.9.13	and the treader of grapes him who sows the seed;
AMO.9.13	the mountains shall drip sweet wine,
AMO.9.13	and all the hills shall flow with it.
AMO.9.14	I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel,
AMO.9.14	and they shall rebuild the ruined cities and inhabit them;
AMO.9.14	they shall plant vineyards and drink their wine,
AMO.9.14	and they shall make gardens and eat their fruit.
AMO.9.15	I will plant them upon their land,
AMO.9.15	and they shall never again be plucked up
AMO.9.15	out of the land which I have given them,”
AMO.9.15	says the 
OBA.1.1	Thus says the Lord 
OBA.1.1	We have heard tidings from the 
OBA.1.1	and a messenger has been sent among the nations:
OBA.1.1	“Rise up! let us rise against her for battle!”
OBA.1.2	Behold, I will make you small among the nations,
OBA.1.2	you shall be utterly despised.
OBA.1.3	The pride of your heart has deceived you,
OBA.1.3	you who live in the clefts of the rock,
OBA.1.3	whose dwelling is high,
OBA.1.3	who say in your heart,
OBA.1.3	“Who will bring me down to the ground?”
OBA.1.4	Though you soar aloft like the eagle,
OBA.1.4	though your nest is set among the stars,
OBA.1.4	thence I will bring you down,
OBA.1.4	says the 
OBA.1.5	If thieves came to you,
OBA.1.5	if plunderers by night—
OBA.1.5	how you have been destroyed!—
OBA.1.5	would they not steal only enough for themselves?
OBA.1.5	If grape gatherers came to you,
OBA.1.5	would they not leave gleanings?
OBA.1.6	How Esau has been pillaged,
OBA.1.6	his treasures sought out!
OBA.1.7	All your allies have deceived you,
OBA.1.7	they have driven you to the border;
OBA.1.7	your confederates have prevailed against you;
OBA.1.7	your trusted friends have set a trap under you—
OBA.1.7	there is no understanding of it.
OBA.1.8	Will I not on that day, says the 
OBA.1.8	destroy the wise men out of Edom,
OBA.1.8	and understanding out of Mount Esau?
OBA.1.9	And your mighty men shall be dismayed, O Teman,
OBA.1.9	so that every man from Mount Esau will be cut off by slaughter.
OBA.1.10	For the violence done to your brother Jacob,
OBA.1.10	shame shall cover you,
OBA.1.10	and you shall be cut off for ever.
OBA.1.11	On the day that you stood aloof,
OBA.1.11	on the day that strangers carried off his wealth,
OBA.1.11	and foreigners entered his gates
OBA.1.11	and cast lots for Jerusalem,
OBA.1.11	you were like one of them.
OBA.1.12	But you should not have gloated over the day of your brother
OBA.1.12	in the day of his misfortune;
OBA.1.12	you should not have rejoiced over the people of Judah
OBA.1.12	in the day of their ruin;
OBA.1.12	you should not have boasted
OBA.1.12	in the day of distress.
OBA.1.13	You should not have entered the gate of my people
OBA.1.13	in the day of his calamity;
OBA.1.13	you should not have gloated over his disaster
OBA.1.13	in the day of his calamity;
OBA.1.13	you should not have looted his goods
OBA.1.13	in the day of his calamity.
OBA.1.14	You should not have stood at the parting of the ways
OBA.1.14	to cut off his fugitives;
OBA.1.14	you should not have delivered up his survivors
OBA.1.14	in the day of distress.
OBA.1.15	For the day of the 
OBA.1.15	As you have done, it shall be done to you,
OBA.1.15	your deeds shall return on your own head.
OBA.1.16	For as you have drunk upon my holy mountain,
OBA.1.16	all the nations round about shall drink;
OBA.1.16	they shall drink, and stagger,
OBA.1.16	and shall be as though they had not been.
OBA.1.17	But in Mount Zion there shall be those that escape,
OBA.1.17	and it shall be holy;
OBA.1.17	and the house of Jacob shall possess their own possessions.
OBA.1.18	The house of Jacob shall be a fire,
OBA.1.18	and the house of Joseph a flame,
OBA.1.18	and the house of Esau stubble;
OBA.1.18	they shall burn them and consume them,
OBA.1.18	and there shall be no survivor to the house of Esau:
OBA.1.18	for the 
OBA.1.19	Those of the Negeb shall possess Mount Esau,
OBA.1.19	and those of the Shephelah the land of the Philistines;
OBA.1.19	they shall possess the land of Ephraim and the land of Samaria
OBA.1.19	and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.
OBA.1.20	The exiles in Halah
OBA.1.20	shall possess
OBA.1.20	and the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad
OBA.1.20	shall possess the cities of the Negeb.
OBA.1.21	Saviors shall go up to Mount Zion
OBA.1.21	to rule Mount Esau;
OBA.1.21	and the kingdom shall be the 
JON.1.1	Now the word of the 
JON.1.2	“Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness has come up before me.” 
JON.1.3	But Jonah rose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the 
JON.1.4	But the 
JON.1.5	Then the mariners were afraid, and each cried to his god; and they threw the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it for them. But Jonah had gone down into the inner part of the ship and had lain down, and was fast asleep. 
JON.1.6	So the captain came and said to him, “What do you mean, you sleeper? Arise, call upon your god! Perhaps the god will give a thought to us, that we do not perish.”
JON.1.7	And they said to one another, “Come, let us cast lots, that we may know on whose account this evil has come upon us.” So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah. 
JON.1.8	Then they said to him, “Tell us on whose account this evil has come upon us. What is your occupation? And whence do you come? What is your country? And of what people are you?” 
JON.1.9	And he said to them, “I am a Hebrew; and I fear the 
JON.1.10	Then the men were exceedingly afraid, and said to him, “What is this that you have done!” For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the 
JON.1.11	Then they said to him, “What shall we do to you, that the sea may quiet down for us?” For the sea grew more and more tempestuous. 
JON.1.12	He said to them, “Take me up and throw me into the sea; then the sea will quiet down for you; for I know it is because of me that this great tempest has come upon you.” 
JON.1.13	Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring the ship back to land, but they could not, for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them. 
JON.1.14	Therefore they cried to the 
JON.1.15	So they took up Jonah and threw him into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging. 
JON.1.16	Then the men feared the 
JON.2.1	Then Jonah prayed to the 
JON.2.2	saying,
JON.2.2	“I called to the 
JON.2.2	and he answered me;
JON.2.2	out of the belly of Sheol I cried,
JON.2.2	and thou didst hear my voice.
JON.2.3	For thou didst cast me into the deep,
JON.2.3	into the heart of the seas,
JON.2.3	and the flood was round about me;
JON.2.3	all thy waves and thy billows
JON.2.3	passed over me.
JON.2.4	Then I said, ‘I am cast out
JON.2.4	from thy presence;
JON.2.4	how shall I again look
JON.2.4	upon thy holy temple?’
JON.2.5	The waters closed in over me,
JON.2.5	the deep was round about me;
JON.2.5	weeds were wrapped about my head
JON.2.6	at the roots of the mountains.
JON.2.6	I went down to the land
JON.2.6	whose bars closed upon me for ever;
JON.2.6	yet thou didst bring up my life from the Pit,
JON.2.6	O 
JON.2.7	When my soul fainted within me,
JON.2.7	I remembered the 
JON.2.7	and my prayer came to thee,
JON.2.7	into thy holy temple.
JON.2.8	Those who pay regard to vain idols
JON.2.8	forsake their true loyalty.
JON.2.9	But I with the voice of thanksgiving
JON.2.9	will sacrifice to thee;
JON.2.9	what I have vowed I will pay.
JON.2.9	Deliverance belongs to the 
JON.2.10	And the 
JON.3.1	Then the word of the 
JON.3.2	“Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim to it the message that I tell you.” 
JON.3.3	So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh, according to the word of the 
JON.3.4	Jonah began to go into the city, going a day's journey. And he cried, “Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!” 
JON.3.5	And the people of Nineveh believed God; they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them to the least of them.
JON.3.6	Then tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, removed his robe, and covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. 
JON.3.7	And he made proclamation and published through Nineveh, “By the decree of the king and his nobles: Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, or drink water, 
JON.3.8	but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and let them cry mightily to God; yea, let every one turn from his evil way and from the violence which is in his hands. 
JON.3.9	 Who knows, God may yet repent and turn from his fierce anger, so that we perish not?”
JON.3.10	When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil way, God repented of the evil which he had said he would do to them; and he did not do it.
JON.4.1	But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry. 
JON.4.2	 And he prayed to the 
JON.4.3	Therefore now, O 
JON.4.4	And the 
JON.4.5	Then Jonah went out of the city and sat to the east of the city, and made a booth for himself there. He sat under it in the shade, till he should see what would become of the city.
JON.4.6	And the 
JON.4.7	But when dawn came up the next day, God appointed a worm which attacked the plant,
JON.4.8	When the sun rose, God appointed a sultry east wind, and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah so that he was faint; and he asked that he might die, and said, “It is better for me to die than to live.” 
JON.4.9	But God said to Jonah, “Do you do well to be angry for the plant?”
JON.4.10	And the 
JON.4.11	And should not I pity Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons who do not know their right hand from their left, and also much cattle?”
MIC.1.1	The word of the 
MIC.1.2	hearken, O earth, and all that is in it;
MIC.1.2	and let the Lord 
MIC.1.2	the Lord from his holy temple.
MIC.1.3	For behold, the 
MIC.1.3	and will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth.
MIC.1.4	And the mountains will melt under him
MIC.1.4	and the valleys will be cleft,
MIC.1.4	like wax before the fire,
MIC.1.4	like waters poured down a steep place.
MIC.1.5	All this is for the transgression of Jacob
MIC.1.5	and for the sins of the house of Israel.
MIC.1.5	What is the transgression of Jacob?
MIC.1.5	Is it not Samaria?
MIC.1.5	And what is the sin of the house
MIC.1.5	Is it not Jerusalem?
MIC.1.6	Therefore I will make Samaria a heap in the open country,
MIC.1.6	a place for planting vineyards;
MIC.1.6	and I will pour down her stones into the valley,
MIC.1.6	and uncover her foundations.
MIC.1.7	All her images shall be beaten to pieces,
MIC.1.7	all her hires shall be burned with fire,
MIC.1.7	and all her idols I will lay waste;
MIC.1.7	for from the hire of a harlot she gathered them,
MIC.1.7	and to the hire of a harlot they shall return.
MIC.1.8	For this I will lament and wail;
MIC.1.8	I will go stripped and naked;
MIC.1.8	I will make lamentation like the jackals,
MIC.1.8	and mourning like the ostriches.
MIC.1.9	For her wound
MIC.1.9	and it has come to Judah,
MIC.1.9	it has reached to the gate of my people,
MIC.1.9	to Jerusalem.
MIC.1.10	Tell it not in Gath,
MIC.1.10	weep not at all;
MIC.1.10	in Beth-le-aphrah
MIC.1.10	roll yourselves in the dust.
MIC.1.11	Pass on your way,
MIC.1.11	inhabitants of Shaphir,
MIC.1.11	in nakedness and shame;
MIC.1.11	the inhabitants of Zaanan
MIC.1.11	do not come forth;
MIC.1.11	the wailing of Beth-ezel
MIC.1.11	shall take away from you its standing place.
MIC.1.12	For the inhabitants of Maroth
MIC.1.12	wait anxiously for good,
MIC.1.12	because evil has come down from the 
MIC.1.12	to the gate of Jerusalem.
MIC.1.13	Harness the steeds to the chariots,
MIC.1.13	inhabitants of Lachish;
MIC.1.13	you were
MIC.1.13	to the daughter of Zion,
MIC.1.13	for in you were found
MIC.1.13	the transgressions of Israel.
MIC.1.14	Therefore you shall give parting gifts
MIC.1.14	to Moresheth-gath;
MIC.1.14	the houses of Achzib shall be a deceitful thing
MIC.1.14	to the kings of Israel.
MIC.1.15	I will again bring a conqueror upon you,
MIC.1.15	inhabitants of Mareshah;
MIC.1.15	the glory of Israel
MIC.1.15	shall come to Adullam.
MIC.1.16	Make yourselves bald and cut off your hair,
MIC.1.16	for the children of your delight;
MIC.1.16	make yourselves as bald as the eagle,
MIC.1.16	for they shall go from you into exile.
MIC.2.1	Woe to those who devise wickedness
MIC.2.1	and work evil upon their beds!
MIC.2.1	When the morning dawns, they perform it,
MIC.2.1	because it is in the power of their hand.
MIC.2.2	They covet fields, and seize them;
MIC.2.2	and houses, and take them away;
MIC.2.2	they oppress a man and his house,
MIC.2.2	a man and his inheritance.
MIC.2.3	Therefore thus says the 
MIC.2.3	Behold, against this family I am devising evil,
MIC.2.3	from which you cannot remove your necks;
MIC.2.3	and you shall not walk haughtily,
MIC.2.3	for it will be an evil time.
MIC.2.4	In that day they shall take up a taunt song against you,
MIC.2.4	and wail with bitter lamentation,
MIC.2.4	and say, “We are utterly ruined;
MIC.2.4	he changes the portion of my people;
MIC.2.4	how he removes it from me!
MIC.2.4	Among our captors
MIC.2.5	Therefore you will have none to cast the line by lot
MIC.2.5	in the assembly of the 
MIC.2.6	“Do not preach”—thus they preach—
MIC.2.6	“one should not preach of such things;
MIC.2.6	disgrace will not overtake us.”
MIC.2.7	Should this be said, O house of Jacob?
MIC.2.7	Is the Spirit of the 
MIC.2.7	Are these his doings?
MIC.2.7	Do not my words do good
MIC.2.7	to him who walks uprightly?
MIC.2.8	But you rise against my people
MIC.2.8	you strip the robe from the peaceful,
MIC.2.8	from those who pass by trustingly
MIC.2.8	with no thought of war.
MIC.2.9	The women of my people you drive out
MIC.2.9	from their pleasant houses;
MIC.2.9	from their young children you take away
MIC.2.9	my glory for ever.
MIC.2.10	Arise and go,
MIC.2.10	for this is no place to rest;
MIC.2.10	because of uncleanness that destroys
MIC.2.10	with a grievous destruction.
MIC.2.11	If a man should go about and utter wind and lies,
MIC.2.11	saying, “I will preach to you of wine and strong drink,”
MIC.2.11	he would be the preacher for this people!
MIC.2.12	I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob,
MIC.2.12	I will gather the remnant of Israel;
MIC.2.12	I will set them together
MIC.2.12	like sheep in a fold,
MIC.2.12	like a flock in its pasture,
MIC.2.12	a noisy multitude of men.
MIC.2.13	He who opens the breach will go up before them;
MIC.2.13	they will break through and pass the gate,
MIC.2.13	going out by it.
MIC.2.13	Their king will pass on before them,
MIC.2.13	the 
MIC.3.1	And I said:
MIC.3.1	Hear, you heads of Jacob
MIC.3.1	and rulers of the house of Israel!
MIC.3.1	Is it not for you to know justice?—
MIC.3.2	you who hate the good and love the evil,
MIC.3.2	who tear the skin from off my people,
MIC.3.2	and their flesh from off their bones;
MIC.3.3	who eat the flesh of my people,
MIC.3.3	and flay their skin from off them,
MIC.3.3	and break their bones in pieces,
MIC.3.3	and chop them up like meat
MIC.3.3	like flesh in a caldron.
MIC.3.4	Then they will cry to the 
MIC.3.4	but he will not answer them;
MIC.3.4	he will hide his face from them at that time,
MIC.3.4	because they have made their deeds evil.
MIC.3.5	Thus says the 
MIC.3.5	who lead my people astray,
MIC.3.5	who cry “Peace”
MIC.3.5	when they have something to eat,
MIC.3.5	but declare war against him
MIC.3.5	who puts nothing into their mouths.
MIC.3.6	Therefore it shall be night to you, without vision,
MIC.3.6	and darkness to you, without divination.
MIC.3.6	The sun shall go down upon the prophets,
MIC.3.6	and the day shall be black over them;
MIC.3.7	the seers shall be disgraced,
MIC.3.7	and the diviners put to shame;
MIC.3.7	they shall all cover their lips,
MIC.3.7	for there is no answer from God.
MIC.3.8	But as for me, I am filled with power,
MIC.3.8	with the Spirit of the 
MIC.3.8	and with justice and might,
MIC.3.8	to declare to Jacob his transgression
MIC.3.8	and to Israel his sin.
MIC.3.9	Hear this, you heads of the house of Jacob
MIC.3.9	and rulers of the house of Israel,
MIC.3.9	who abhor justice
MIC.3.9	and pervert all equity,
MIC.3.10	who build Zion with blood
MIC.3.10	and Jerusalem with wrong.
MIC.3.11	Its heads give judgment for a bribe,
MIC.3.11	its priests teach for hire,
MIC.3.11	its prophets divine for money;
MIC.3.11	yet they lean upon the 
MIC.3.11	“Is not the 
MIC.3.11	No evil shall come upon us.”
MIC.3.12	Therefore because of you
MIC.3.12	Zion shall be plowed as a field;
MIC.3.12	Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins,
MIC.3.12	and the mountain of the house a wooded height.
MIC.4.1	that the mountain of the house of the 
MIC.4.1	shall be established as the highest of the mountains,
MIC.4.1	and shall be raised up above the hills;
MIC.4.1	and peoples shall flow to it,
MIC.4.2	and many nations shall come, and say:
MIC.4.2	“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the 
MIC.4.2	to the house of the God of Jacob;
MIC.4.2	that he may teach us his ways
MIC.4.2	and we may walk in his paths.”
MIC.4.2	For out of Zion shall go forth the law,
MIC.4.2	and the word of the 
MIC.4.3	He shall judge between many peoples,
MIC.4.3	and shall decide for strong nations afar off;
MIC.4.3	and they shall beat their swords into plowshares,
MIC.4.3	and their spears into pruning hooks;
MIC.4.3	nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
MIC.4.3	neither shall they learn war any more;
MIC.4.4	and none shall make them afraid;
MIC.4.4	for the mouth of the 
MIC.4.5	For all the peoples walk
MIC.4.5	each in the name of its god,
MIC.4.5	but we will walk in the name of the 
MIC.4.5	for ever and ever.
MIC.4.6	In that day, says the 
MIC.4.6	I will assemble the lame
MIC.4.6	and gather those who have been driven away,
MIC.4.6	and those whom I have afflicted;
MIC.4.7	and the lame I will make the remnant;
MIC.4.7	and those who were cast off, a strong nation;
MIC.4.7	and the 
MIC.4.7	from this time forth and for evermore.
MIC.4.8	And you, O tower of the flock,
MIC.4.8	hill of the daughter of Zion,
MIC.4.8	to you shall it come,
MIC.4.8	the former dominion shall come,
MIC.4.8	the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.
MIC.4.9	Now why do you cry aloud?
MIC.4.9	Is there no king in you?
MIC.4.9	Has your counselor perished,
MIC.4.9	that pangs have seized you like a woman in travail?
MIC.4.10	Writhe and groan,
MIC.4.10	like a woman in travail;
MIC.4.10	for now you shall go forth from the city
MIC.4.10	and dwell in the open country;
MIC.4.10	you shall go to Babylon.
MIC.4.10	There you shall be rescued,
MIC.4.10	there the 
MIC.4.10	from the hand of your enemies.
MIC.4.11	Now many nations
MIC.4.11	are assembled against you,
MIC.4.11	saying, “Let her be profaned,
MIC.4.11	and let our eyes gaze upon Zion.”
MIC.4.12	But they do not know
MIC.4.12	the thoughts of the 
MIC.4.12	they do not understand his plan,
MIC.4.12	that he has gathered them as sheaves to the threshing floor.
MIC.4.13	Arise and thresh,
MIC.4.13	O daughter of Zion,
MIC.4.13	for I will make your horn iron
MIC.4.13	and your hoofs bronze;
MIC.4.13	you shall beat in pieces many peoples,
MIC.4.13	and shall
MIC.4.13	their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth.
MIC.5.1	Now you are walled about with a wall;
MIC.5.1	siege is laid against us;
MIC.5.1	with a rod they strike upon the cheek
MIC.5.1	the ruler of Israel.
MIC.5.2	who are little to be among the clans of Judah,
MIC.5.2	from you shall come forth for me
MIC.5.2	one who is to be ruler in Israel,
MIC.5.2	whose origin is from of old,
MIC.5.2	from ancient days.
MIC.5.3	Therefore he shall give them up until the time
MIC.5.3	when she who is in travail has brought forth;
MIC.5.3	then the rest of his brethren shall return
MIC.5.3	to the people of Israel.
MIC.5.4	And he shall stand and feed his flock in the strength of the 
MIC.5.4	in the majesty of the name of the 
MIC.5.4	And they shall dwell secure, for now he shall be great
MIC.5.4	to the ends of the earth.
MIC.5.5	And this shall be peace,
MIC.5.5	when the Assyrian comes into our land
MIC.5.5	and treads upon our soil,
MIC.5.5	that we will raise against him seven shepherds
MIC.5.5	and eight princes of men;
MIC.5.6	they shall rule the land of Assyria with the sword,
MIC.5.6	and the land of Nimrod with the drawn sword;
MIC.5.6	and they
MIC.5.6	when he comes into our land
MIC.5.6	and treads within our border.
MIC.5.7	Then the remnant of Jacob shall be
MIC.5.7	in the midst of many peoples
MIC.5.7	like dew from the 
MIC.5.7	like showers upon the grass,
MIC.5.7	which tarry not for men
MIC.5.7	nor wait for the sons of men.
MIC.5.8	And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations,
MIC.5.8	in the midst of many peoples,
MIC.5.8	like a lion among the beasts of the forest,
MIC.5.8	like a young lion among the flocks of sheep,
MIC.5.8	which, when it goes through, treads down
MIC.5.8	and tears in pieces, and there is none to deliver.
MIC.5.9	Your hand shall be lifted up over your adversaries,
MIC.5.9	and all your enemies shall be cut off.
MIC.5.10	And in that day, says the 
MIC.5.10	I will cut off your horses from among you
MIC.5.10	and will destroy your chariots;
MIC.5.11	and I will cut off the cities of your land
MIC.5.11	and throw down all your strongholds;
MIC.5.12	and I will cut off sorceries from your hand,
MIC.5.12	and you shall have no more soothsayers;
MIC.5.13	and I will cut off your images
MIC.5.13	and your pillars from among you,
MIC.5.13	and you shall bow down no more
MIC.5.13	to the work of your hands;
MIC.5.14	and I will root out your Asherim from among you
MIC.5.14	and destroy your cities.
MIC.5.15	And in anger and wrath I will execute vengeance
MIC.5.15	upon the nations that did not obey.
MIC.6.1	Hear what the 
MIC.6.1	Arise, plead your case before the mountains,
MIC.6.1	and let the hills hear your voice.
MIC.6.2	Hear, you mountains, the controversy of the 
MIC.6.2	and you enduring foundations of the earth;
MIC.6.2	for the 
MIC.6.2	and he will contend with Israel.
MIC.6.3	“O my people, what have I done to you?
MIC.6.3	In what have I wearied you? Answer me!
MIC.6.4	For I brought you up from the land of Egypt,
MIC.6.4	and redeemed you from the house of bondage;
MIC.6.4	and I sent before you Moses,
MIC.6.4	Aaron, and Miriam.
MIC.6.5	O my people, remember what Balak king of Moab devised,
MIC.6.5	and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him,
MIC.6.5	and what happened from Shittim to Gilgal,
MIC.6.5	that you may know the saving acts of the 
MIC.6.6	“With what shall I come before the 
MIC.6.6	and bow myself before God on high?
MIC.6.6	Shall I come before him with burnt offerings,
MIC.6.6	with calves a year old?
MIC.6.7	Will the 
MIC.6.7	with ten thousands of rivers of oil?
MIC.6.7	Shall I give my first-born for my transgression,
MIC.6.7	the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?”
MIC.6.8	He has showed you, O man, what is good;
MIC.6.8	and what does the 
MIC.6.8	but to do justice, and to love kindness,
MIC.6.8	and to walk humbly with your God?
MIC.6.9	The voice of the 
MIC.6.9	and it is sound wisdom to fear thy name:
MIC.6.9	“Hear, O tribe and assembly of the city!
MIC.6.10	Can I forget the
MIC.6.10	and the scant measure that is accursed?
MIC.6.11	Shall I acquit the man with wicked scales
MIC.6.11	and with a bag of deceitful weights?
MIC.6.12	Your
MIC.6.12	your
MIC.6.12	and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.
MIC.6.13	Therefore I have begun
MIC.6.13	making you desolate because of your sins.
MIC.6.14	You shall eat, but not be satisfied,
MIC.6.14	and there shall be hunger in your inward parts;
MIC.6.14	you shall put away, but not save,
MIC.6.14	and what you save I will give to the sword.
MIC.6.15	You shall sow, but not reap;
MIC.6.15	you shall tread olives, but not anoint yourselves with oil;
MIC.6.15	you shall tread grapes, but not drink wine.
MIC.6.16	For you have kept the statutes of Omri,
MIC.6.16	and all the works of the house of Ahab;
MIC.6.16	and you have walked in their counsels;
MIC.6.16	that I may make you a desolation, and your
MIC.6.16	so you shall bear the scorn of the peoples.”
MIC.7.1	Woe is me! For I have become
MIC.7.1	as when the summer fruit has been gathered,
MIC.7.1	as when the vintage has been gleaned:
MIC.7.1	there is no cluster to eat,
MIC.7.1	no first-ripe fig which my soul desires.
MIC.7.2	The godly man has perished from the earth,
MIC.7.2	and there is none upright among men;
MIC.7.2	they all lie in wait for blood,
MIC.7.2	and each hunts his brother with a net.
MIC.7.3	Their hands are upon what is evil, to do it diligently;
MIC.7.3	the prince and the judge ask for a bribe,
MIC.7.3	and the great man utters the evil desire of his soul;
MIC.7.3	thus they weave it together.
MIC.7.4	The best of them is like a brier,
MIC.7.4	the most upright of them a thorn hedge.
MIC.7.4	The day of their
MIC.7.4	now their confusion is at hand.
MIC.7.5	Put no trust in a neighbor,
MIC.7.5	have no confidence in a friend;
MIC.7.5	guard the doors of your mouth
MIC.7.5	from her who lies in your bosom;
MIC.7.6	the daughter rises up against her mother,
MIC.7.6	the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;
MIC.7.6	a man's enemies are the men of his own house.
MIC.7.7	But as for me, I will look to the 
MIC.7.7	I will wait for the God of my salvation;
MIC.7.7	my God will hear me.
MIC.7.8	Rejoice not over me, O my enemy;
MIC.7.8	when I fall, I shall rise;
MIC.7.8	when I sit in darkness,
MIC.7.8	the 
MIC.7.9	I will bear the indignation of the 
MIC.7.9	because I have sinned against him,
MIC.7.9	until he pleads my cause
MIC.7.9	and executes judgment for me.
MIC.7.9	He will bring me forth to the light;
MIC.7.9	I shall behold his deliverance.
MIC.7.10	Then my enemy will see,
MIC.7.10	and shame will cover her who said to me,
MIC.7.10	“Where is the 
MIC.7.10	My eyes will gloat over her;
MIC.7.10	now she will be trodden down
MIC.7.10	like the mire of the streets.
MIC.7.11	A day for the building of your walls!
MIC.7.11	In that day the boundary shall be far extended.
MIC.7.12	In that day they will come to you,
MIC.7.12	from Assyria to
MIC.7.12	and from Egypt to the River,
MIC.7.12	from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain.
MIC.7.13	But the earth will be desolate
MIC.7.13	because of its inhabitants,
MIC.7.13	for the fruit of their doings.
MIC.7.14	Shepherd thy people with thy staff,
MIC.7.14	the flock of thy inheritance,
MIC.7.14	who dwell alone in a forest
MIC.7.14	in the midst of a garden land;
MIC.7.14	let them feed in Bashan and Gilead
MIC.7.14	as in the days of old.
MIC.7.15	As in the days when you came out of the land of Egypt
MIC.7.15	I will show them
MIC.7.16	The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might;
MIC.7.16	they shall lay their hands on their mouths;
MIC.7.16	their ears shall be deaf;
MIC.7.17	they shall lick the dust like a serpent,
MIC.7.17	like the crawling things of the earth;
MIC.7.17	they shall come trembling out of their strongholds,
MIC.7.17	they shall turn in dread to the 
MIC.7.17	and they shall fear because of thee.
MIC.7.18	Who is a God like thee, pardoning iniquity
MIC.7.18	and passing over transgression
MIC.7.18	for the remnant of his inheritance?
MIC.7.18	He does not retain his anger for ever
MIC.7.18	because he delights in steadfast love.
MIC.7.19	He will again have compassion upon us,
MIC.7.19	he will tread our iniquities under foot.
MIC.7.19	Thou wilt cast all our
MIC.7.19	into the depths of the sea.
MIC.7.20	and steadfast love to Abraham,
MIC.7.20	as thou hast sworn to our fathers
MIC.7.20	from the days of old.

NAM.1.3	and the 
NAM.1.3	His way is in whirlwind and storm,
NAM.1.3	and the clouds are the dust of his feet.
NAM.1.4	He rebukes the sea and makes it dry,
NAM.1.4	he dries up all the rivers;
NAM.1.4	Bashan and Carmel wither,
NAM.1.4	the bloom of Lebanon fades.
NAM.1.5	The mountains quake before him,
NAM.1.5	the hills melt;
NAM.1.5	the earth is laid waste before him,
NAM.1.5	the world and all that dwell therein.
NAM.1.6	Who can stand before his indignation?
NAM.1.6	Who can endure the heat of his anger?
NAM.1.6	His wrath is poured out like fire,

NAM.1.14	I will make your grave, for you are vile.”
NAM.1.15	who brings good tidings,
NAM.1.15	who proclaims peace!
NAM.1.15	Keep your feasts, O Judah,
NAM.1.15	fulfil your vows,
NAM.1.15	for never again shall the wicked come against you,
NAM.1.15	he is utterly cut off.
NAM.2.1	The shatterer has come up against you.
NAM.2.1	Man the ramparts;
NAM.2.1	watch the road;
NAM.2.1	gird your loins;
NAM.2.1	collect all your strength.
NAM.2.2	(For the 
NAM.2.2	as the majesty of Israel,
NAM.2.2	for plunderers have stripped them
NAM.2.2	and ruined their branches.)
NAM.2.3	The shield of his mighty men is red,
NAM.2.3	his soldiers are clothed in scarlet.
NAM.2.3	The chariots flash like flame
NAM.2.3	when mustered in array;
NAM.2.3	the chargers
NAM.2.4	The chariots rage in the streets,
NAM.2.4	they rush to and fro through the squares;
NAM.2.4	they gleam like torches,
NAM.2.4	they dart like lightning.
NAM.2.5	The officers are summoned,
NAM.2.5	they stumble as they go,
NAM.2.5	they hasten to the wall,
NAM.2.5	the mantelet is set up.
NAM.2.6	The river gates are opened,
NAM.2.6	the palace is in dismay;
NAM.2.7	its mistress
NAM.2.7	her maidens lamenting,
NAM.2.7	moaning like doves,
NAM.2.7	and beating their breasts.
NAM.2.8	Nineveh is like a pool
NAM.2.8	whose waters
NAM.2.8	“Halt! Halt!” they cry;
NAM.2.8	but none turns back.
NAM.2.9	Plunder the silver,
NAM.2.9	plunder the gold!
NAM.2.9	There is no end of treasure,
NAM.2.9	or wealth of every precious thing.
NAM.2.10	Desolate! Desolation and ruin!
NAM.2.10	Hearts faint and knees tremble,
NAM.2.10	anguish is on all loins,
NAM.2.10	all faces grow pale!
NAM.2.11	Where is the lions' den,
NAM.2.11	the cave
NAM.2.11	where the lion brought his prey,
NAM.2.11	where his cubs were, with none to disturb?
NAM.2.12	The lion tore enough for his whelps
NAM.2.12	and strangled prey for his lionesses;
NAM.2.12	he filled his caves with prey
NAM.2.12	and his dens with torn flesh.
NAM.2.13	Behold, I am against you, says the 
NAM.3.1	Woe to the bloody city,
NAM.3.1	all full of lies and booty—
NAM.3.1	no end to the plunder!
NAM.3.2	The crack of whip, and rumble of wheel,
NAM.3.2	galloping horse and bounding chariot!
NAM.3.3	Horsemen charging,
NAM.3.3	flashing sword and glittering spear,
NAM.3.3	hosts of slain,
NAM.3.3	heaps of corpses,
NAM.3.3	dead bodies without end—
NAM.3.3	they stumble over the bodies!
NAM.3.4	And all for the countless harlotries of the harlot,
NAM.3.4	graceful and of deadly charms,
NAM.3.4	who betrays nations with her harlotries,
NAM.3.4	and peoples with her charms.
NAM.3.5	Behold, I am against you,
NAM.3.5	says the 
NAM.3.5	and will lift up your skirts over your face;
NAM.3.5	and I will let nations look on your nakedness
NAM.3.5	and kingdoms on your shame.
NAM.3.6	I will throw filth at you
NAM.3.6	and treat you with contempt,
NAM.3.6	and make you a gazingstock.
NAM.3.7	And all who look on you will shrink from you and say,
NAM.3.7	Wasted is Nineveh; who will bemoan her?
NAM.3.7	whence shall I seek comforters for her?
NAM.3.8	Are you better than Thebes
NAM.3.8	that sat by the Nile,
NAM.3.8	with water around her,
NAM.3.8	her rampart a sea,
NAM.3.8	and water her wall?
NAM.3.9	Ethiopia was her strength,
NAM.3.9	Egypt too, and that without limit;
NAM.3.9	Put and the Libyans were her
NAM.3.10	Yet she was carried away,
NAM.3.10	she went into captivity;
NAM.3.10	her little ones were dashed in pieces
NAM.3.10	at the head of every street;
NAM.3.10	for her honored men lots were cast,
NAM.3.10	and all her great men were bound in chains.
NAM.3.11	You also will be drunken,
NAM.3.11	you will be dazed;
NAM.3.11	you will seek
NAM.3.11	a refuge from the enemy.
NAM.3.12	All your fortresses are like fig trees
NAM.3.12	with first-ripe figs—
NAM.3.12	if shaken they fall
NAM.3.12	into the mouth of the eater.
NAM.3.13	Behold, your troops
NAM.3.13	are women in your midst.
NAM.3.13	The gates of your land
NAM.3.13	are wide open to your foes;
NAM.3.13	fire has devoured your bars.
NAM.3.14	Draw water for the siege,
NAM.3.14	strengthen your forts;
NAM.3.14	go into the clay,
NAM.3.14	tread the mortar,
NAM.3.14	take hold of the brick mold!
NAM.3.15	There will the fire devour you,
NAM.3.15	the sword will cut you off.
NAM.3.15	It will devour you like the locust.
NAM.3.15	Multiply yourselves like the locust,
NAM.3.15	multiply like the grasshopper!
NAM.3.16	You increased your merchants
NAM.3.16	more than the stars of the heavens.
NAM.3.16	The locust spreads its wings and flies away.
NAM.3.17	Your princes are like grasshoppers,
NAM.3.17	your scribes
NAM.3.17	settling on the fences
NAM.3.17	in a day of cold—
NAM.3.17	when the sun rises, they fly away;
NAM.3.17	no one knows where they are.
NAM.3.18	Your shepherds are asleep,
NAM.3.18	O king of Assyria;
NAM.3.18	your nobles slumber.
NAM.3.18	Your people are scattered on the mountains
NAM.3.18	with none to gather them.
NAM.3.19	There is no assuaging your hurt,
NAM.3.19	your wound is grievous.
NAM.3.19	All who hear the news of you
NAM.3.19	clap their hands over you.
NAM.3.19	For upon whom has not come
NAM.3.19	your unceasing evil?
HAB.1.1	The oracle of God which Habakkuk the prophet saw.
HAB.1.2	and thou wilt not hear?
HAB.1.2	Or cry to thee “Violence!”
HAB.1.2	and thou wilt not save?
HAB.1.3	Why dost thou make me see wrongs
HAB.1.3	and look upon trouble?
HAB.1.3	Destruction and violence are before me;
HAB.1.3	strife and contention arise.
HAB.1.4	So the law is slacked
HAB.1.4	and justice never goes forth.
HAB.1.4	For the wicked surround the righteous,
HAB.1.4	so justice goes forth perverted.
HAB.1.5	wonder and be astounded.
HAB.1.5	For I am doing a work in your days
HAB.1.5	that you would not believe if told.
HAB.1.6	that bitter and hasty nation,
HAB.1.6	who march through the breadth of the earth,
HAB.1.6	to seize habitations not their own.
HAB.1.7	Dread and terrible are they;
HAB.1.7	their justice and dignity proceed from themselves.
HAB.1.8	Their horses are swifter than leopards,
HAB.1.8	more fierce than the evening wolves;
HAB.1.8	their horsemen press proudly on.
HAB.1.8	Yea, their horsemen come from afar;
HAB.1.8	they fly like an eagle swift to devour.
HAB.1.9	They all come for violence;
HAB.1.9	terror
HAB.1.9	They gather captives like sand.
HAB.1.10	At kings they scoff,
HAB.1.10	and of rulers they make sport.
HAB.1.10	They laugh at every fortress,
HAB.1.10	for they heap up earth and take it.
HAB.1.11	Then they sweep by like the wind and go on,
HAB.1.11	guilty men, whose own might is their god!
HAB.1.12	Art thou not from everlasting,
HAB.1.12	O 
HAB.1.12	We shall not die.
HAB.1.12	O 
HAB.1.12	and thou, O Rock, hast established them for chastisement.
HAB.1.13	Thou who art of purer eyes than to behold evil
HAB.1.13	and canst not look on wrong,
HAB.1.13	why dost thou look on faithless men,
HAB.1.13	and art silent when the wicked swallows up
HAB.1.13	the man more righteous than he?
HAB.1.14	For thou makest men like the fish of the sea,
HAB.1.14	like crawling things that have no ruler.
HAB.1.15	He brings all of them up with a hook,
HAB.1.15	he drags them out with his net,
HAB.1.15	he gathers them in his seine;
HAB.1.15	so he rejoices and exults.
HAB.1.16	Therefore he sacrifices to his net
HAB.1.16	and burns incense to his seine;
HAB.1.16	for by them he lives in luxury,
HAB.1.16	and his food is rich.
HAB.1.17	Is he then to keep on emptying his net,
HAB.1.17	and mercilessly slaying nations for ever?
HAB.2.1	and station myself on the tower,
HAB.2.1	and look forth to see what he will say to me,
HAB.2.1	and what I will answer concerning my complaint.
HAB.2.2	And the 
HAB.2.2	“Write the vision;
HAB.2.2	make it plain upon tablets,
HAB.2.2	so he may run who reads it.
HAB.2.3	it hastens to the end—it will not lie.
HAB.2.3	If it seem slow, wait for it;
HAB.2.3	it will surely come, it will not delay.
HAB.2.4	but the righteous shall live by his faith.
HAB.2.5	Moreover, wine is treacherous;
HAB.2.5	the arrogant man shall not abide.
HAB.2.5	His greed is as wide as Sheol;
HAB.2.5	like death he has never enough.
HAB.2.5	He gathers for himself all nations,
HAB.2.5	and collects as his own all peoples.”
HAB.2.6	Shall not all these take up their taunt against him, in scoffing derision of him, and say,
HAB.2.6	“Woe to him who heaps up what is not his own—
HAB.2.6	for how long?—
HAB.2.6	and loads himself with pledges!”
HAB.2.7	Will not your debtors suddenly arise,
HAB.2.7	and those awake who will make you tremble?
HAB.2.7	Then you will be booty for them.
HAB.2.8	Because you have plundered many nations,
HAB.2.8	all the remnant of the peoples shall plunder you,
HAB.2.8	for the blood of men and violence to the earth,
HAB.2.8	to cities and all who dwell therein.
HAB.2.9	Woe to him who gets evil gain for his house,
HAB.2.9	to set his nest on high,
HAB.2.9	to be safe from the reach of harm!
HAB.2.10	You have devised shame to your house
HAB.2.10	by cutting off many peoples;
HAB.2.10	you have forfeited your life.
HAB.2.11	For the stone will cry out from the wall,
HAB.2.11	and the beam from the woodwork respond.
HAB.2.12	Woe to him who builds a town with blood,
HAB.2.12	and founds a city on iniquity!
HAB.2.13	Behold, is it not from the 
HAB.2.13	that peoples labor only for fire,
HAB.2.13	and nations weary themselves for naught?
HAB.2.14	with the knowledge of the glory of the 
HAB.2.14	as the waters cover the sea.
HAB.2.15	Woe to him who makes his neighbors drink
HAB.2.15	of the cup of his wrath,
HAB.2.15	to gaze on their shame!
HAB.2.16	You will be sated with contempt instead of glory.
HAB.2.16	Drink, yourself, and stagger!
HAB.2.16	The cup in the 
HAB.2.16	will come around to you,
HAB.2.16	and shame will come upon your glory!
HAB.2.17	The violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you;
HAB.2.17	the destruction of the beasts will terrify you,
HAB.2.17	for the blood of men and violence to the earth,
HAB.2.17	to cities and all who dwell therein.
HAB.2.18	What profit is an idol
HAB.2.18	when its maker has shaped it,
HAB.2.18	a metal image, a teacher of lies?
HAB.2.18	For the workman trusts in his own creation
HAB.2.18	when he makes dumb idols!
HAB.2.19	Woe to him who says to a wooden thing, Awake;
HAB.2.19	to a dumb stone, Arise!
HAB.2.19	Can this give revelation?
HAB.2.19	Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver,
HAB.2.19	and there is no breath at all in it.
HAB.2.20	let all the earth keep silence before him.
HAB.3.1	A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to Shigionoth.
HAB.3.2	O 
HAB.3.2	and thy work, O 
HAB.3.2	In the midst of the years renew it;
HAB.3.2	in the midst of the years make it known;
HAB.3.2	in wrath remember mercy.
HAB.3.3	God came from Teman,
HAB.3.3	and the Holy One from Mount Paran.
HAB.3.3	His glory covered the heavens,
HAB.3.3	and the earth was full of his praise. 
HAB.3.4	His brightness was like the light,
HAB.3.4	rays flashed from his hand;
HAB.3.4	and there he veiled his power.
HAB.3.5	Before him went pestilence,
HAB.3.5	and plague followed close behind.
HAB.3.6	He stood and measured the earth;
HAB.3.6	he looked and shook the nations;
HAB.3.6	then the eternal mountains were scattered,
HAB.3.6	the everlasting hills sank low.
HAB.3.6	His ways were as of old.
HAB.3.7	I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction;
HAB.3.7	the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
HAB.3.8	Was thy wrath against the rivers, O 
HAB.3.8	Was thy anger against the rivers,
HAB.3.8	or thy indignation against the sea,
HAB.3.8	when thou didst ride upon thy horses,
HAB.3.8	upon thy chariot of victory?
HAB.3.9	Thou didst strip the sheath from thy bow,
HAB.3.9	and put the arrows to the string.
HAB.3.9	Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.
HAB.3.10	The mountains saw thee, and writhed;
HAB.3.10	the raging waters swept on;
HAB.3.10	the deep gave forth its voice,
HAB.3.10	it lifted its hands on high.
HAB.3.11	The sun and moon stood still in their habitation
HAB.3.11	at the light of thine arrows as they sped,
HAB.3.11	at the flash of thy glittering spear.
HAB.3.12	Thou didst bestride the earth in fury,
HAB.3.12	thou didst trample the nations in anger.
HAB.3.13	Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people,
HAB.3.13	for the salvation of thy anointed.
HAB.3.13	Thou didst crush the head of the wicked,
HAB.3.13	laying him bare from thigh to neck.
HAB.3.14	Thou didst pierce with thy
HAB.3.14	who came like a whirlwind to scatter me,
HAB.3.14	rejoicing as if to devour the poor in secret.
HAB.3.15	Thou didst trample the sea with thy horses,
HAB.3.15	the surging of mighty waters.
HAB.3.16	I hear, and my body trembles,
HAB.3.16	my lips quiver at the sound;
HAB.3.16	rottenness enters into my bones,
HAB.3.16	my steps totter
HAB.3.16	I will quietly wait for the day of trouble
HAB.3.16	to come upon people who invade us.
HAB.3.17	Though the fig tree do not blossom,
HAB.3.17	nor fruit be on the vines,
HAB.3.17	the produce of the olive fail
HAB.3.17	and the fields yield no food,
HAB.3.17	the flock be cut off from the fold
HAB.3.17	and there be no herd in the stalls,
HAB.3.18	yet I will rejoice in the 
HAB.3.18	I will joy in the God of my salvation.
HAB.3.19	he makes my feet like hinds' feet,
HAB.3.19	he makes me tread upon my high places.
HAB.3.19	To the choirmaster: with stringed
ZEP.1.1	The word of the 
ZEP.1.2	“I will utterly sweep away everything
ZEP.1.2	from the face of the earth,” says the 
ZEP.1.3	“I will sweep away man and beast;
ZEP.1.3	I will sweep away the birds of the air
ZEP.1.3	and the fish of the sea.
ZEP.1.3	I will overthrow
ZEP.1.3	I will cut off mankind
ZEP.1.3	from the face of the earth,” says the 
ZEP.1.4	“I will stretch out my hand against Judah,
ZEP.1.4	and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
ZEP.1.4	and I will cut off from this place the remnant of Baal
ZEP.1.4	and the name of the idolatrous priests;
ZEP.1.5	those who bow down on the roofs
ZEP.1.5	to the host of the heavens;
ZEP.1.5	those who bow down and swear to the 
ZEP.1.5	and yet swear by Milcom;
ZEP.1.6	those who have turned back from following the 
ZEP.1.6	who do not seek the 
ZEP.1.7	For the day of the 
ZEP.1.7	the 
ZEP.1.7	and consecrated his guests.
ZEP.1.8	And on the day of the 
ZEP.1.8	“I will punish the officials and the king's sons
ZEP.1.8	and all who array themselves in foreign attire.
ZEP.1.9	On that day I will punish
ZEP.1.9	every one who leaps over the threshold,
ZEP.1.9	and those who fill their master's house
ZEP.1.9	with violence and fraud.”
ZEP.1.10	“On that day,” says the 
ZEP.1.10	“a cry will be heard from the Fish Gate,
ZEP.1.10	a wail from the Second Quarter,
ZEP.1.10	a loud crash from the hills.
ZEP.1.11	Wail, O inhabitants of the Mortar!
ZEP.1.11	For all the traders are no more;
ZEP.1.11	all who weigh out silver are cut off.
ZEP.1.12	At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps,
ZEP.1.12	and I will punish the men
ZEP.1.12	who are thickening upon their lees,
ZEP.1.12	those who say in their hearts,
ZEP.1.12	‘The 
ZEP.1.12	nor will he do ill.’
ZEP.1.13	Their goods shall be plundered,
ZEP.1.13	and their houses laid waste.
ZEP.1.13	Though they build houses,
ZEP.1.13	they shall not inhabit them;
ZEP.1.13	though they plant vineyards,
ZEP.1.13	they shall not drink wine from them.”
ZEP.1.14	The great day of the 
ZEP.1.14	near and hastening fast;
ZEP.1.14	the sound of the day of the 
ZEP.1.14	the mighty man cries aloud there.
ZEP.1.15	A day of wrath is that day,
ZEP.1.15	a day of distress and anguish,
ZEP.1.15	a day of ruin and devastation,
ZEP.1.15	a day of darkness and gloom,
ZEP.1.15	a day of clouds and thick darkness,
ZEP.1.16	a day of trumpet blast and battle cry
ZEP.1.16	against the fortified cities
ZEP.1.16	and against the lofty battlements.
ZEP.1.17	I will bring distress on men,
ZEP.1.17	so that they shall walk like the blind,
ZEP.1.17	because they have sinned against the 
ZEP.1.17	their blood shall be poured out like dust,
ZEP.1.17	and their flesh like dung.
ZEP.1.18	Neither their silver nor their gold
ZEP.1.18	shall be able to deliver them
ZEP.1.18	on the day of the wrath of the 
ZEP.1.18	In the fire of his jealous wrath,
ZEP.1.18	all the earth shall be consumed;
ZEP.1.18	for a full, yea, sudden end
ZEP.1.18	he will make of all the inhabitants of the earth.
ZEP.2.1	Come together and hold assembly,
ZEP.2.1	O shameless nation,
ZEP.2.2	before you are driven away
ZEP.2.2	like the drifting chaff,
ZEP.2.2	before there comes upon you
ZEP.2.2	the fierce anger of the 
ZEP.2.2	before there comes upon you
ZEP.2.2	the day of the wrath of the 
ZEP.2.3	Seek the 
ZEP.2.3	who do his commands;
ZEP.2.3	seek righteousness, seek humility;
ZEP.2.3	perhaps you may be hidden
ZEP.2.3	on the day of the wrath of the 
ZEP.2.4	and Ashkelon shall become a desolation;
ZEP.2.4	Ashdod's people shall be driven out at noon,
ZEP.2.4	and Ekron shall be uprooted.
ZEP.2.5	Woe to you inhabitants of the seacoast,
ZEP.2.5	you nation of the Cherethites!
ZEP.2.5	The word of the 
ZEP.2.5	O Canaan, land of the Philistines;
ZEP.2.5	and I will destroy you till no inhabitant is left.
ZEP.2.6	And you, O seacoast, shall be pastures,
ZEP.2.6	meadows for shepherds
ZEP.2.6	and folds for flocks.
ZEP.2.7	The seacoast shall become the possession
ZEP.2.7	of the remnant of the house of Judah,
ZEP.2.7	on which they shall pasture,
ZEP.2.7	and in the houses of Ashkelon
ZEP.2.7	they shall lie down at evening.
ZEP.2.7	For the 
ZEP.2.7	and restore their fortunes.
ZEP.2.8	and the revilings of the Ammonites,
ZEP.2.8	how they have taunted my people
ZEP.2.8	and made boasts against their territory.
ZEP.2.9	Therefore, as I live,” says the 
ZEP.2.9	the God of Israel,
ZEP.2.9	“Moab shall become like Sodom,
ZEP.2.9	and the Ammonites like Gomorrah,
ZEP.2.9	a land possessed by nettles and salt pits,
ZEP.2.9	and a waste for ever.
ZEP.2.9	The remnant of my people shall plunder them,
ZEP.2.9	and the survivors of my nation shall possess them.”
ZEP.2.10	This shall be their lot in return for their pride,
ZEP.2.10	because they scoffed and boasted
ZEP.2.10	against the people of the 
ZEP.2.11	The 
ZEP.2.11	yea, he will famish all the gods of the earth,
ZEP.2.11	and to him shall bow down,
ZEP.2.11	each in its place,
ZEP.2.11	all the lands of the nations.
ZEP.2.12	shall be slain by my sword.
ZEP.2.13	and destroy Assyria;
ZEP.2.13	and he will make Nineveh a desolation,
ZEP.2.13	a dry waste like the desert.
ZEP.2.14	Herds shall lie down in the midst of her,
ZEP.2.14	all the beasts of the field;
ZEP.2.14	the vulture
ZEP.2.14	shall lodge in her capitals;
ZEP.2.14	the owl
ZEP.2.14	the raven
ZEP.2.14	for her cedar work will be laid bare.
ZEP.2.15	This is the exultant city
ZEP.2.15	that dwelt secure,
ZEP.2.15	that said to herself,
ZEP.2.15	“I am and there is none else.”
ZEP.2.15	What a desolation she has become,
ZEP.2.15	a lair for wild beasts!
ZEP.2.15	Every one who passes by her
ZEP.2.15	hisses and shakes his fist.
ZEP.3.1	Woe to her that is rebellious and defiled,
ZEP.3.1	the oppressing city!
ZEP.3.2	She listens to no voice,
ZEP.3.2	she accepts no correction.
ZEP.3.2	She does not trust in the 
ZEP.3.2	she does not draw near to her God.
ZEP.3.3	Her officials within her
ZEP.3.3	are roaring lions;
ZEP.3.3	her judges are evening wolves
ZEP.3.3	that leave nothing till the morning.
ZEP.3.4	Her prophets are wanton, faithless men;
ZEP.3.4	her priests profane what is sacred,
ZEP.3.4	they do violence to the law.
ZEP.3.5	The 
ZEP.3.5	he does no wrong;
ZEP.3.5	every morning he shows forth his justice,
ZEP.3.5	each dawn he does not fail;
ZEP.3.5	but the unjust knows no shame.
ZEP.3.6	“I have cut off nations;
ZEP.3.6	their battlements are in ruins;
ZEP.3.6	I have laid waste their streets
ZEP.3.6	so that none walks in them;
ZEP.3.6	their cities have been made desolate,
ZEP.3.6	without a man, without an inhabitant.
ZEP.3.7	I said, ‘Surely she will fear me,
ZEP.3.7	she will accept correction;
ZEP.3.7	she will not lose sight
ZEP.3.7	of all that I have enjoined upon her.’
ZEP.3.7	But all the more they were eager
ZEP.3.7	to make all their deeds corrupt.”
ZEP.3.8	“Therefore wait for me,” says the 
ZEP.3.8	“for the day when I arise as a witness.
ZEP.3.8	For my decision is to gather nations,
ZEP.3.8	to assemble kingdoms,
ZEP.3.8	to pour out upon them my indignation,
ZEP.3.8	all the heat of my anger;
ZEP.3.8	for in the fire of my jealous wrath
ZEP.3.8	all the earth shall be consumed.
ZEP.3.9	“Yea, at that time I will change the speech of the peoples
ZEP.3.9	to a pure speech,
ZEP.3.9	that all of them may call on the name of the 
ZEP.3.9	and serve him with one accord.
ZEP.3.10	From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia
ZEP.3.10	my suppliants, the daughter of my dispersed ones,
ZEP.3.10	shall bring my offering.
ZEP.3.11	“On that day you shall not be put to shame
ZEP.3.11	because of the deeds by which you have rebelled against me;
ZEP.3.11	for then I will remove from your midst
ZEP.3.11	your proudly exultant ones,
ZEP.3.11	and you shall no longer be haughty
ZEP.3.11	in my holy mountain.
ZEP.3.12	For I will leave in the midst of you
ZEP.3.12	a people humble and lowly.
ZEP.3.12	They shall seek refuge in the name of the 
ZEP.3.13	they shall do no wrong
ZEP.3.13	and utter no lies,
ZEP.3.13	nor shall there be found in their mouth
ZEP.3.13	a deceitful tongue.
ZEP.3.13	For they shall pasture and lie down,
ZEP.3.13	and none shall make them afraid.”
ZEP.3.14	Sing aloud, O daughter of Zion;
ZEP.3.14	shout, O Israel!
ZEP.3.14	Rejoice and exult with all your heart,
ZEP.3.14	O daughter of Jerusalem!
ZEP.3.15	The 
ZEP.3.15	he has cast out your enemies.
ZEP.3.15	The King of Israel, the 
ZEP.3.15	you shall fear evil no more.
ZEP.3.16	On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem:
ZEP.3.16	“Do not fear, O Zion;
ZEP.3.16	let not your hands grow weak.
ZEP.3.17	The 
ZEP.3.17	a warrior who gives victory;
ZEP.3.17	he will rejoice over you with gladness,
ZEP.3.17	he will renew you
ZEP.3.17	he will exult over you with loud singing
ZEP.3.18	as on a day of festival.
ZEP.3.18	“I will remove disaster
ZEP.3.18	so that you will not bear reproach for it.
ZEP.3.19	Behold, at that time I will deal
ZEP.3.19	with all your oppressors.
ZEP.3.19	And I will save the lame
ZEP.3.19	and gather the outcast,
ZEP.3.19	and I will change their shame into praise
ZEP.3.19	and renown in all the earth.
ZEP.3.20	At that time I will bring you home,
ZEP.3.20	at the time when I gather you together;
ZEP.3.20	yea, I will make you renowned and praised
ZEP.3.20	among all the peoples of the earth,
ZEP.3.20	when I restore your fortunes
ZEP.3.20	before your eyes,” says the 
HAG.1.1	In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the 
HAG.1.2	“Thus says the 
HAG.1.3	Then the word of the 
HAG.1.4	“Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins? 
HAG.1.5	Now therefore thus says the 
HAG.1.6	You have sown much, and harvested little; you eat, but you never have enough; you drink, but you never have your fill; you clothe yourselves, but no one is warm; and he who earns wages earns wages to put them into a bag with holes.
HAG.1.7	“Thus says the 
HAG.1.8	Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house, that I may take pleasure in it and that I may appear in my glory, says the 
HAG.1.9	You have looked for much, and lo, it came to little; and when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why? says the 
HAG.1.10	Therefore the heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its produce. 
HAG.1.11	And I have called for a drought upon the land and the hills, upon the grain, the new wine, the oil, upon what the ground brings forth, upon men and cattle, and upon all their labors.”
HAG.1.12	Then Zerubbabel the son of She-alti-el, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the 
HAG.1.13	Then Haggai, the messenger of the 
HAG.1.14	And the 
HAG.1.15	on the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month.
HAG.2.1	In the second year of Darius the king, in the seventh month, on the twenty-first day of the month, the word of the 
HAG.2.2	“Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of She-alti-el, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to all the remnant of the people, and say, 
HAG.2.3	‘Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? How do you see it now? Is it not in your sight as nothing? 
HAG.2.4	Yet now take courage, O Zerubbabel, says the 
HAG.2.5	according to the promise that I made you when you came out of Egypt. My Spirit abides among you; fear not. 
HAG.2.6	 For thus says the 
HAG.2.7	and I will shake all nations, so that the treasures of all nations shall come in, and I will fill this house with splendor, says the 
HAG.2.8	The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, says the 
HAG.2.9	The latter splendor of this house shall be greater than the former, says the 
HAG.2.10	On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the 
HAG.2.11	“Thus says the 
HAG.2.12	‘If one carries holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and touches with his skirt bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any kind of food, does it become holy?’ ” The priests answered, “No.” 
HAG.2.13	Then said Haggai, “If one who is unclean by contact with a dead body touches any of these, does it become unclean?” The priests answered, “It does become unclean.” 
HAG.2.14	Then Haggai said, “So is it with this people, and with this nation before me, says the 
HAG.2.15	Pray now, consider what will come to pass from this day onward. Before a stone was placed upon a stone in the temple of the 
HAG.2.16	how did you fare?
HAG.2.17	I smote you and all the products of your toil with blight and mildew and hail; yet you did not return to me, says the 
HAG.2.18	Consider from this day onward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month. Since the day that the foundation of the 
HAG.2.19	Is the seed yet in the barn? Do the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree still yield nothing? From this day on I will bless you.”
HAG.2.20	The word of the 
HAG.2.21	“Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I am about to shake the heavens and the earth, 
HAG.2.22	and to overthrow the throne of kingdoms; I am about to destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations, and overthrow the chariots and their riders; and the horses and their riders shall go down, every one by the sword of his fellow. 
HAG.2.23	On that day, says the 
ZEC.1.1	In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the 
ZEC.1.2	“The 
ZEC.1.3	Therefore say to them, Thus says the 
ZEC.1.4	Be not like your fathers, to whom the former prophets cried out, ‘Thus says the 
ZEC.1.5	Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live for ever? 
ZEC.1.6	But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? So they repented and said, As the 
ZEC.1.7	On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month which is the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the 
ZEC.1.8	“I saw in the night, and behold, a man riding upon a red horse! He was standing among the myrtle trees in the glen; and behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses. 
ZEC.1.9	Then I said, ‘What are these, my lord?’ The angel who talked with me said to me, ‘I will show you what they are.’ 
ZEC.1.10	So the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered, ‘These are they whom the 
ZEC.1.11	And they answered the angel of the 
ZEC.1.12	Then the angel of the 
ZEC.1.13	And the 
ZEC.1.14	So the angel who talked with me said to me, ‘Cry out, Thus says the 
ZEC.1.15	And I am very angry with the nations that are at ease; for while I was angry but a little they furthered the disaster. 
ZEC.1.16	Therefore, thus says the 
ZEC.1.17	Cry again, Thus says the 
ZEC.1.19	And I said to the angel who talked with me, “What are these?” And he answered me, “These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.” 
ZEC.1.20	Then the 
ZEC.1.21	And I said, “What are these coming to do?” He answered, “These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man raised his head; and these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations who lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter it.”
ZEC.2.2	Then I said, “Where are you going?” And he said to me, “To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its breadth and what is its length.” 
ZEC.2.3	And behold, the angel who talked with me came forward, and another angel came forward to meet him, 
ZEC.2.4	and said to him, “Run, say to that young man, ‘Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, because of the multitude of men and cattle in it. 
ZEC.2.5	For I will be to her a wall of fire round about, says the 
ZEC.2.6	Ho! ho! Flee from the land of the north, says the 
ZEC.2.7	Ho! Escape to Zion, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon. 
ZEC.2.8	For thus said the 
ZEC.2.9	“Behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they shall become plunder for those who served them. Then you will know that the 
ZEC.2.10	Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; for lo, I come and I will dwell in the midst of you, says the 
ZEC.2.11	And many nations shall join themselves to the 
ZEC.2.12	And the 
ZEC.3.1	Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the 
ZEC.3.2	 And the 
ZEC.3.3	Now Joshua was standing before the angel, clothed with filthy garments. 
ZEC.3.4	And the angel said to those who were standing before him, “Remove the filthy garments from him.” And to him he said, “Behold, I have taken your iniquity away from you, and I will clothe you with rich apparel.” 
ZEC.3.5	And I said, “Let them put a clean turban on his head.” So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments; and the angel of the 
ZEC.3.6	And the angel of the 
ZEC.3.7	“Thus says the 
ZEC.3.8	 Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who sit before you, for they are men of good omen: behold, I will bring my servant the Branch. 
ZEC.3.9	For behold, upon the stone which I have set before Joshua, upon a single stone with seven facets, I will engrave its inscription, says the 
ZEC.3.10	 In that day, says the 
ZEC.4.1	And the angel who talked with me came again, and waked me, like a man that is wakened out of his sleep. 
ZEC.4.2	And he said to me, “What do you see?” I said, “I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps which are on the top of it. 
ZEC.4.3	 And there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.” 
ZEC.4.4	And I said to the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” 
ZEC.4.5	Then the angel who talked with me answered me, “Do you not know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.” 
ZEC.4.6	Then he said to me, “This is the word of the 
ZEC.4.7	What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain; and he shall bring forward the top stone amid shouts of ‘Grace, grace to it!’ ” 
ZEC.4.8	Moreover the word of the 
ZEC.4.9	“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also complete it. Then you will know that the 
ZEC.4.10	 For whoever has despised the day of small things shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel.
ZEC.4.10	“These seven are the eyes of the 
ZEC.4.11	Then I said to him, “What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?” 
ZEC.4.12	And a second time I said to him, “What are these two branches of the olive trees, which are beside the two golden pipes from which the oil
ZEC.4.13	He said to me, “Do you not know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.” 
ZEC.4.14	Then he said, “These are the two anointed who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.”
ZEC.5.1	Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, a flying scroll! 
ZEC.5.2	And he said to me, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits, and its breadth ten cubits.” 
ZEC.5.3	Then he said to me, “This is the curse that goes out over the face of the whole land; for every one who steals shall be cut off henceforth according to it, and every one who swears falsely shall be cut off henceforth according to it. 
ZEC.5.4	I will send it forth, says the 
ZEC.5.5	Then the angel who talked with me came forward and said to me, “Lift your eyes, and see what this is that goes forth.” 
ZEC.5.6	And I said, “What is it?” He said, “This is the ephah that goes forth.” And he said, “This is their iniquity
ZEC.5.7	And behold, the leaden cover was lifted, and there was a woman sitting in the ephah! 
ZEC.5.8	And he said, “This is Wickedness.” And he thrust her back into the ephah, and thrust down the leaden weight upon its mouth. 
ZEC.5.9	Then I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, two women coming forward! The wind was in their wings; they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between earth and heaven. 
ZEC.5.10	Then I said to the angel who talked with me, “Where are they taking the ephah?” 
ZEC.5.11	He said to me, “To the land of Shinar, to build a house for it; and when this is prepared, they will set the ephah down there on its base.”
ZEC.6.2	The first chariot had red horses, the second black horses, 
ZEC.6.3	the third white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled gray
ZEC.6.4	Then I said to the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” 
ZEC.6.5	 And the angel answered me, “These are going forth to the four winds of heaven, after presenting themselves before the 
ZEC.6.6	The chariot with the black horses goes toward the north country, the white ones go toward the west country,
ZEC.6.7	When the steeds came out, they were impatient to get off and patrol the earth. And he said, “Go, patrol the earth.” So they patrolled the earth. 
ZEC.6.8	Then he cried to me, “Behold, those who go toward the north country have set my Spirit at rest in the north country.”
ZEC.6.9	And the word of the 
ZEC.6.10	“Take from the exiles Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon; and go the same day to the house of Josiah, the son of Zephaniah. 
ZEC.6.11	Take from them silver and gold, and make a crown,
ZEC.6.12	 and say to him, ‘Thus says the 
ZEC.6.13	It is he who shall build the temple of the 
ZEC.6.14	And the crown
ZEC.6.15	“And those who are far off shall come and help to build the temple of the 
ZEC.7.1	In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the 
ZEC.7.2	Now the people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech and their men, to entreat the favor of the 
ZEC.7.3	and to ask the priests of the house of the 
ZEC.7.4	Then the word of the 
ZEC.7.5	“Say to all the people of the land and the priests, When you fasted and mourned in the fifth month and in the seventh, for these seventy years, was it for me that you fasted? 
ZEC.7.6	And when you eat and when you drink, do you not eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves? 
ZEC.7.7	When Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, with her cities round about her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited, were not these the words which the 
ZEC.7.8	And the word of the 
ZEC.7.9	“Thus says the 
ZEC.7.10	do not oppress the widow, the fatherless, the sojourner, or the poor; and let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart.” 
ZEC.7.11	But they refused to hearken, and turned a stubborn shoulder, and stopped their ears that they might not hear. 
ZEC.7.12	They made their hearts like adamant lest they should hear the law and the words which the 
ZEC.7.13	“As I called, and they would not hear, so they called, and I would not hear,” says the 
ZEC.7.14	“and I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations which they had not known. Thus the land they left was desolate, so that no one went to and fro, and the pleasant land was made desolate.”
ZEC.8.1	And the word of the 
ZEC.8.2	“Thus says the 
ZEC.8.3	Thus says the 
ZEC.8.4	Thus says the 
ZEC.8.5	And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets. 
ZEC.8.6	Thus says the 
ZEC.8.7	Thus says the 
ZEC.8.8	and I will bring them to dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be my people and I will be their God, in faithfulness and in righteousness.”
ZEC.8.9	Thus says the 
ZEC.8.10	For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for beast, neither was there any safety from the foe for him who went out or came in; for I set every man against his fellow. 
ZEC.8.11	But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as in the former days, says the 
ZEC.8.12	For there shall be a sowing of peace; the vine shall yield its fruit, and the ground shall give its increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things. 
ZEC.8.13	And as you have been a byword of cursing among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you and you shall be a blessing. Fear not, but let your hands be strong.”
ZEC.8.14	For thus says the 
ZEC.8.15	so again have I purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah; fear not. 
ZEC.8.16	 These are the things that you shall do: Speak the truth to one another, render in your gates judgments that are true and make for peace, 
ZEC.8.17	do not devise evil in your hearts against one another, and love no false oath, for all these things I hate, says the 
ZEC.8.18	And the word of the 
ZEC.8.19	“Thus says the 
ZEC.8.20	“Thus says the 
ZEC.8.21	the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, ‘Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the

ZEC.9.1	An Oracle

ZEC.9.1	and will rest upon Damascus.
ZEC.9.1	For to the 
ZEC.9.1	even as all the tribes of Israel;
ZEC.9.2	Hamath also, which borders thereon,
ZEC.9.2	Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise.
ZEC.9.3	Tyre has built herself a rampart,
ZEC.9.3	and heaped up silver like dust,
ZEC.9.3	and gold like the mud of the streets.
ZEC.9.4	But lo, the Lord will strip her of her possessions
ZEC.9.4	and hurl her wealth into the sea,
ZEC.9.4	and she shall be devoured by fire.
ZEC.9.5	Ashkelon shall see it, and be afraid;
ZEC.9.5	Gaza too, and shall writhe in anguish;
ZEC.9.5	Ekron also, because its hopes are confounded.
ZEC.9.5	The king shall perish from Gaza;
ZEC.9.5	Ashkelon shall be uninhabited;
ZEC.9.6	a mongrel people shall dwell in Ashdod;
ZEC.9.6	and I will make an end of the pride of Philistia.
ZEC.9.7	I will take away its blood from its mouth,
ZEC.9.7	and its abominations from between its teeth;
ZEC.9.7	it too shall be a remnant for our God;
ZEC.9.7	it shall be like a clan in Judah,
ZEC.9.7	and Ekron shall be like the Jebusites.
ZEC.9.8	Then I will encamp at my house as a guard,
ZEC.9.8	so that none shall march to and fro;
ZEC.9.8	no oppressor shall again overrun them,
ZEC.9.8	for now I see with my own eyes.
ZEC.9.9	Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem!
ZEC.9.9	Lo, your king comes to you;
ZEC.9.9	triumphant and victorious is he,
ZEC.9.9	humble and riding on an ass,
ZEC.9.9	on a colt the foal of an ass.
ZEC.9.10	I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim
ZEC.9.10	and the war horse from Jerusalem;
ZEC.9.10	and the battle bow shall be cut off,
ZEC.9.10	and he shall command peace to the nations;
ZEC.9.10	his dominion shall be from sea to sea,
ZEC.9.10	and from the River to the ends of the earth.
ZEC.9.11	As for you also, because of the blood of my covenant with you,
ZEC.9.11	I will set your captives free from the waterless pit.
ZEC.9.12	Return to your stronghold, O prisoners of hope;
ZEC.9.12	today I declare that I will restore to you double.
ZEC.9.13	For I have bent Judah as my bow;
ZEC.9.13	I have made Ephraim its arrow.
ZEC.9.13	I will brandish your sons, O Zion,
ZEC.9.13	over your sons, O Greece,
ZEC.9.13	and wield you like a warrior's sword.
ZEC.9.14	Then the 
ZEC.9.14	and his arrow go forth like lightning;
ZEC.9.14	the Lord 
ZEC.9.14	and march forth in the whirlwinds of the south.
ZEC.9.15	The 
ZEC.9.15	and they shall devour and tread down the slingers;
ZEC.9.15	and they shall drink their blood
ZEC.9.15	and be full like a bowl,
ZEC.9.15	drenched like the corners of the altar.
ZEC.9.16	On that day the 
ZEC.9.16	for they are the flock of his people;
ZEC.9.16	for like the jewels of a crown
ZEC.9.16	they shall shine on his land.
ZEC.9.17	Yea, how good and how fair it shall be!
ZEC.9.17	Grain shall make the young men flourish,
ZEC.9.17	and new wine the maidens.
ZEC.10.1	Ask rain from the 
ZEC.10.1	in the season of the spring rain,
ZEC.10.1	from the 
ZEC.10.1	who gives men showers of rain,
ZEC.10.1	to every one the vegetation in the field.
ZEC.10.2	For the teraphim utter nonsense,
ZEC.10.2	and the diviners see lies;
ZEC.10.2	the dreamers tell false dreams,
ZEC.10.2	and give empty consolation.
ZEC.10.2	Therefore the people wander like sheep;
ZEC.10.2	they are afflicted for want of a shepherd.
ZEC.10.3	“My anger is hot against the shepherds,
ZEC.10.3	and I will punish the leaders;
ZEC.10.3	for the 
ZEC.10.3	and will make them like his proud steed in battle.
ZEC.10.4	Out of them shall come the cornerstone,
ZEC.10.4	out of them the tent peg,
ZEC.10.4	out of them the battle bow,
ZEC.10.4	out of them every ruler.
ZEC.10.5	Together they shall be like mighty men in battle,
ZEC.10.5	trampling the foe in the mud of the streets;
ZEC.10.5	they shall fight because the 
ZEC.10.5	and they shall confound the riders on horses.
ZEC.10.6	“I will strengthen the house of Judah,
ZEC.10.6	and I will save the house of Joseph.
ZEC.10.6	I will bring them back because I have compassion on them,
ZEC.10.6	and they shall be as though I had not rejected them;
ZEC.10.6	for I am the 
ZEC.10.7	Then Ephraim shall become like a mighty warrior,
ZEC.10.7	and their hearts shall be glad as with wine.
ZEC.10.7	Their children shall see it and rejoice,
ZEC.10.7	their hearts shall exult in the 
ZEC.10.8	“I will signal for them and gather them in,
ZEC.10.8	for I have redeemed them,
ZEC.10.8	and they shall be as many as of old.
ZEC.10.9	Though I scattered them among the nations,
ZEC.10.9	yet in far countries they shall remember me,
ZEC.10.9	and with their children they shall live and return.
ZEC.10.10	I will bring them home from the land of Egypt,
ZEC.10.10	and gather them from Assyria;
ZEC.10.10	and I will bring them to the land of Gilead and to Lebanon,
ZEC.10.10	till there is no room for them.
ZEC.10.11	They shall pass through the sea of Egypt,
ZEC.10.11	and the waves of the sea shall be smitten,
ZEC.10.11	and all the depths of the Nile dried up.
ZEC.10.11	The pride of Assyria shall be laid low,
ZEC.10.11	and the scepter of Egypt shall depart.
ZEC.10.12	I will make them strong in the 
ZEC.10.12	and they shall glory

ZEC.11.1	Open your doors, O Lebanon,
ZEC.11.1	that the fire may devour your cedars!
ZEC.11.2	Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen,
ZEC.11.2	for the glorious trees are ruined!
ZEC.11.2	Wail, oaks of Bashan,
ZEC.11.2	for the thick forest has been felled!
ZEC.11.3	Hark, the wail of the shepherds,
ZEC.11.3	for their glory is despoiled!
ZEC.11.3	Hark, the roar of the lions,
ZEC.11.3	for the jungle of the Jordan is laid waste!
ZEC.11.4	Thus said the 
ZEC.11.5	Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished; and those who sell them say, ‘Blessed be the 
ZEC.11.6	For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of this land, says the 
ZEC.11.7	So I became the shepherd of the flock doomed to be slain for those who trafficked in the sheep. And I took two staffs; one I named Grace, the other I named Union. And I tended the sheep. 
ZEC.11.8	In one month I destroyed the three shepherds. But I became impatient with them, and they also detested me. 
ZEC.11.9	So I said, “I will not be your shepherd. What is to die, let it die; what is to be destroyed, let it be destroyed; and let those that are left devour the flesh of one another.” 
ZEC.11.10	And I took my staff Grace, and I broke it, annulling the covenant which I had made with all the peoples. 
ZEC.11.11	So it was annulled on that day, and the traffickers in the sheep, who were watching me, knew that it was the word of the 
ZEC.11.12	 Then I said to them, “If it seems right to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them.” And they weighed out as my wages thirty shekels of silver. 
ZEC.11.13	Then the 
ZEC.11.14	Then I broke my second staff Union, annulling the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
ZEC.11.15	Then the 
ZEC.11.16	For lo, I am raising up in the land a shepherd who does not care for the perishing, or seek the wandering,
ZEC.11.17	Woe to my worthless shepherd,
ZEC.11.17	who deserts the flock!
ZEC.11.17	May the sword smite his arm
ZEC.11.17	and his right eye!
ZEC.11.17	Let his arm be wholly withered,
ZEC.11.17	his right eye utterly blinded!”
ZEC.12.1	An Oracle
ZEC.12.1	The word of the 
ZEC.12.2	“Lo, I am about to make Jerusalem a cup of reeling to all the peoples round about; it will be against Judah also in the siege against Jerusalem. 
ZEC.12.3	On that day I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it shall grievously hurt themselves. And all the nations of the earth will come together against it. 
ZEC.12.4	On that day, says the 
ZEC.12.5	Then the clans of Judah shall say to themselves, ‘The inhabitants of Jerusalem have strength through the 
ZEC.12.6	“On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a blazing pot in the midst of wood, like a flaming torch among sheaves; and they shall devour to the right and to the left all the peoples round about, while Jerusalem shall still be inhabited in its place, in Jerusalem.
ZEC.12.7	“And the 
ZEC.12.8	On that day the 
ZEC.12.9	And on that day I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
ZEC.12.11	On that day the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning for Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo. 
ZEC.12.12	The land shall mourn, each family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves; 
ZEC.12.13	the family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shime-ites by itself, and their wives by themselves; 
ZEC.12.14	and all the families that are left, each by itself, and their wives by themselves.
ZEC.13.1	“On that day there shall be a fountain opened for the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to cleanse them from sin and uncleanness.
ZEC.13.2	“And on that day, says the 
ZEC.13.3	And if any one again appears as a prophet, his father and mother who bore him will say to him, ‘You shall not live, for you speak lies in the name of the 
ZEC.13.4	On that day every prophet will be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies; he will not put on a hairy mantle in order to deceive, 
ZEC.13.5	but he will say, ‘I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the soil; for the land has been my possession
ZEC.13.6	And if one asks him, ‘What are these wounds on your back?’ he will say, ‘The wounds I received in the house of my friends.’ ”
ZEC.13.7	against the man who stands next to me,”
ZEC.13.7	says the 
ZEC.13.7	“Strike the shepherd, that the sheep may be scattered;
ZEC.13.7	I will turn my hand against the little ones.
ZEC.13.8	In the whole land, says the 
ZEC.13.8	two thirds shall be cut off and perish,
ZEC.13.8	and one third shall be left alive.
ZEC.13.9	And I will put this third into the fire,
ZEC.13.9	and refine them as one refines silver,
ZEC.13.9	and test them as gold is tested.
ZEC.13.9	They will call on my name,
ZEC.13.9	and I will answer them.
ZEC.13.9	I will say, ‘They are my people’;
ZEC.13.9	and they will say, ‘The 
ZEC.14.1	Behold, a day of the 
ZEC.14.2	For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city shall be taken and the houses plundered and the women ravished; half of the city shall go into exile, but the rest of the people shall not be cut off from the city. 
ZEC.14.3	Then the 
ZEC.14.4	On that day his feet shall stand on the Mount of Olives which lies before Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives shall be split in two from east to west by a very wide valley; so that one half of the Mount shall withdraw northward, and the other half southward. 
ZEC.14.5	And the valley of my mountains shall be stopped up, for the valley of the mountains shall touch the side of it; and you shall flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the 
ZEC.14.6	On that day there shall be neither cold nor frost.
ZEC.14.7	And there shall be continuous day (it is known to the 
ZEC.14.9	And the 
ZEC.14.10	The whole land shall be turned into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. But Jerusalem shall remain aloft upon its site from the Gate of Benjamin to the place of the former gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king's wine presses. 
ZEC.14.11	 And it shall be inhabited, for there shall be no more curse;
ZEC.14.12	And this shall be the plague with which the 
ZEC.14.13	And on that day a great panic from the 
ZEC.14.14	even Judah will fight against Jerusalem. And the wealth of all the nations round about shall be collected, gold, silver, and garments in great abundance. 
ZEC.14.15	And a plague like this plague shall fall on the horses, the mules, the camels, the asses, and whatever beasts may be in those camps.
ZEC.14.16	Then every one that survives of all the nations that have come against Jerusalem shall go up year after year to worship the King, the 
ZEC.14.17	And if any of the families of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the 
ZEC.14.18	 And if the family of Egypt do not go up and present themselves, then upon them shall
ZEC.14.19	This shall be the punishment to Egypt and the punishment to all the nations that do not go up to keep the feast of booths.
ZEC.14.20	And on that day there shall be inscribed on the bells of the horses, “Holy to the 
ZEC.14.21	and every pot in Jerusalem and Judah shall be sacred to the 
MAL.1.1	The oracle of the word of the 
MAL.1.3	but I have hated Esau; I have laid waste his hill country and left his heritage to jackals of the desert.” 
MAL.1.4	If Edom says, “We are shattered but we will rebuild the ruins,” the 
MAL.1.5	Your own eyes shall see this, and you shall say, “Great is the 
MAL.1.6	“A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If then I am a father, where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is my fear? says the 
MAL.1.7	By offering polluted food upon my altar. And you say, ‘How have we polluted it?’
MAL.1.8	When you offer blind animals in sacrifice, is that no evil? And when you offer those that are lame or sick, is that no evil? Present that to your governor; will he be pleased with you or show you favor? says the 
MAL.1.9	‘And now entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us.’ With such a gift from your hand, will he show favor to any of you? says the 
MAL.1.10	Oh, that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle fire upon my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, says the 
MAL.1.11	For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name is great among the nations, and in every place incense is offered to my name, and a pure offering; for my name is great among the nations, says the 
MAL.1.12	But you profane it when you say that the 
MAL.1.13	‘What a weariness this is,’ you say, and you sniff at me,
MAL.1.14	Cursed be the cheat who has a male in his flock, and vows it, and yet sacrifices to the Lord what is blemished; for I am a great King, says the 
MAL.2.1	“And now, O priests, this command is for you. 
MAL.2.2	If you will not listen, if you will not lay it to heart to give glory to my name, says the 
MAL.2.3	Behold, I will rebuke your offspring, and spread dung upon your faces, the dung of your offerings, and I will put you out of my presence.
MAL.2.4	So shall you know that I have sent this command to you, that my covenant with Levi may hold, says the 
MAL.2.5	My covenant with him was a covenant of life and peace, and I gave them to him, that he might fear; and he feared me, he stood in awe of my name. 
MAL.2.6	True instruction
MAL.2.7	For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and men should seek instruction
MAL.2.8	But you have turned aside from the way; you have caused many to stumble by your instruction;
MAL.2.9	and so I make you despised and abased before all the people, inasmuch as you have not kept my ways but have shown partiality in your instruction.”
MAL.2.10	Have we not all one father? Has not one God created us? Why then are we faithless to one another, profaning the covenant of our fathers? 
MAL.2.11	Judah has been faithless, and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the

MAL.3.2	“For he is like a refiner's fire and like fullers' soap; 
MAL.3.3	he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, till they present right offerings to the

MAL.3.5	“Then I will draw near to you for judgment; I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who swear falsely, against those who oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow and the orphan, against those who thrust aside the sojourner, and do not fear me, says the 
MAL.3.6	“For I the

MAL.3.8	Will man rob God? Yet you are robbing me. But you say, ‘How are we robbing thee?’ In your tithes and offerings. 
MAL.3.9	You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing me; the whole nation of you. 
MAL.3.10	Bring the full tithes into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house; and thereby put me to the test, says the 
MAL.3.11	I will rebuke the devourer

MAL.3.16	Then those who feared the 
MAL.3.17	“They shall be mine, says the 
MAL.3.18	Then once more you shall distinguish between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve him.
MAL.4.2	But for you who fear my name the sun of righteousness shall rise, with healing in its wings. You shall go forth leaping like calves from the stall. 
MAL.4.3	And you shall tread down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet, on the day when I act, says the 
MAL.4.4	“Remember the law of my servant Moses, the statutes and ordinances that I commanded him at Horeb for all Israel.
MAL.4.6	 And he will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the land with a curse.”
MAT.1.2	Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers, 
MAT.1.3	 and Judah the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, and Perez the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram,
MAT.1.4	and Ram
MAT.1.5	and Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse, 
MAT.1.6	and Jesse the father of David the king.
MAT.1.6	And David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah, 
MAT.1.7	and Solomon the father of Rehoboam, and Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asa,
MAT.1.8	and Asa
MAT.1.9	and Uzziah the father of Jotham, and Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah, 
MAT.1.10	and Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh the father of Amos,
MAT.1.11	 and Josiah the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.
MAT.1.12	And after the deportation to Babylon: Jechoniah was the father of She-alti-el,
MAT.1.13	and Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, and Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor, 
MAT.1.14	and Azor the father of Zadok, and Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud, 
MAT.1.15	and Eliud the father of Eleazar, and Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob, 
MAT.1.16	and Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.
MAT.1.17	So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.
MAT.1.19	and her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. 
MAT.1.20	But as he considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit; 
MAT.1.21	 she will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” 
MAT.1.22	All this took place to fulfil what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:
MAT.1.23	and his name shall be called Emmanu-el”
MAT.1.23	(which means, God with us). 
MAT.1.24	When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took his wife, 
MAT.1.25	but knew her not until she had borne a son; and he called his name Jesus.
MAT.2.2	 “Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the East, and have come to worship him.” 
MAT.2.3	When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; 
MAT.2.4	and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. 
MAT.2.5	 They told him, “In Bethlehem of Judea; for so it is written by the prophet:
MAT.2.6	are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;
MAT.2.6	for from you shall come a ruler
MAT.2.6	who will govern my people Israel.’ ”
MAT.2.7	Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star appeared; 
MAT.2.8	and he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.” 
MAT.2.9	When they had heard the king they went their way; and lo, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came to rest over the place where the child was. 
MAT.2.10	When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy; 
MAT.2.11	 and going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. 
MAT.2.12	 And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.
MAT.2.13	Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there till I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.” 
MAT.2.14	And he rose and took the child and his mother by night, and departed to Egypt, 
MAT.2.15	 and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfil what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, “Out of Egypt have I called my son.”
MAT.2.16	Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, was in a furious rage, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time which he had ascertained from the wise men. 
MAT.2.17	Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:
MAT.2.18	wailing and loud lamentation,
MAT.2.18	Rachel weeping for her children;
MAT.2.18	she refused to be consoled,
MAT.2.18	because they were no more.”
MAT.2.20	“Rise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead.” 
MAT.2.21	And he rose and took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel. 
MAT.2.22	But when he heard that Archelaus reigned over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream he withdrew to the district of Galilee. 
MAT.2.23	 And he went and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, “He shall be called a Nazarene.”
MAT.3.2	 “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” 
MAT.3.3	 For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said,
MAT.3.3	“The voice of one crying in the wilderness:
MAT.3.3	Prepare the way of the Lord,
MAT.3.3	make his paths straight.”
MAT.3.5	Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan, 
MAT.3.6	and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
MAT.3.8	Bear fruit that befits repentance, 
MAT.3.9	 and do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father’; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham. 
MAT.3.10	 Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
MAT.3.11	“I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. 
MAT.3.12	 His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the granary, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.”
MAT.3.14	John would have prevented him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?” 
MAT.3.15	But Jesus answered him, “Let it be so now; for thus it is fitting for us to fulfil all righteousness.” Then he consented. 
MAT.3.16	And when Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened
MAT.3.17	 and lo, a voice from heaven, saying, “This is my beloved Son,
MAT.4.2	 And he fasted forty days and forty nights, and afterward he was hungry. 
MAT.4.3	And the tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.” 
MAT.4.4	 But he answered, “It is written,
MAT.4.4	‘Man shall not live by bread alone,
MAT.4.4	but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.’ ”
MAT.4.6	 and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written,
MAT.4.6	‘He will give his angels charge of you,’
MAT.4.6	and
MAT.4.6	‘On their hands they will bear you up,
MAT.4.6	lest you strike your foot against a stone.’ ”
MAT.4.8	Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them; 
MAT.4.9	and he said to him, “All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.” 
MAT.4.10	 Then Jesus said to him, “Begone, Satan! for it is written,
MAT.4.10	‘You shall worship the Lord your God
MAT.4.10	and him only shall you serve.’ ”
MAT.4.13	 and leaving Nazareth he went and dwelt in Caperna-um by the sea, in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali, 
MAT.4.14	that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:
MAT.4.15	toward the sea, across the Jordan,
MAT.4.15	Galilee of the Gentiles—
MAT.4.16	the people who sat in darkness
MAT.4.16	have seen a great light,
MAT.4.16	and for those who sat in the region and shadow of death
MAT.4.16	light has dawned.”
MAT.4.19	And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.” 
MAT.4.20	Immediately they left their nets and followed him. 
MAT.4.21	And going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them. 
MAT.4.22	Immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed him.
MAT.4.24	So his fame spread throughout all Syria, and they brought him all the sick, those afflicted with various diseases and pains, demoniacs, epileptics, and paralytics, and he healed them. 
MAT.4.25	And great crowds followed him from Galilee and the Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and from beyond the Jordan.
MAT.5.2	And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:
MAT.5.7	“Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
MAT.5.9	“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
MAT.5.11	“Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. 
MAT.5.12	 Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so men persecuted the prophets who were before you.
MAT.5.15	 Nor do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. 
MAT.5.16	Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.
MAT.5.17	“Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them. 
MAT.5.18	 For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. 
MAT.5.19	 Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.5.20	For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
MAT.5.22	But I say to you that every one who is angry with his brother
MAT.5.23	So if you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, 
MAT.5.24	leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. 
MAT.5.25	 Make friends quickly with your accuser, while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison; 
MAT.5.26	truly, I say to you, you will never get out till you have paid the last penny.
MAT.5.28	But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 
MAT.5.29	 If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away; it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell.
MAT.5.30	And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away; it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell.
MAT.5.32	But I say to you that every one who divorces his wife, except on the ground of unchastity, makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
MAT.5.34	But I say to you, Do not swear at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, 
MAT.5.35	 or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. 
MAT.5.36	And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. 
MAT.5.37	Let what you say be simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’; anything more than this comes from evil.
MAT.5.39	 But I say to you, Do not resist one who is evil. But if any one strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also; 
MAT.5.40	and if any one would sue you and take your coat, let him have your cloak as well; 
MAT.5.41	and if any one forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. 
MAT.5.42	Give to him who begs from you, and do not refuse him who would borrow from you.
MAT.5.44	But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 
MAT.5.45	so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. 
MAT.5.46	For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? 
MAT.5.47	And if you salute only your brethren, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? 
MAT.5.48	 You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
MAT.6.2	“Thus, when you give alms, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by men. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. 
MAT.6.3	But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 
MAT.6.4	 so that your alms may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
MAT.6.6	But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
MAT.6.8	 Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. 
MAT.6.9	 Pray then like this:
MAT.6.9	Our Father who art in heaven,
MAT.6.9	Hallowed be thy name.
MAT.6.10	Thy kingdom come,
MAT.6.10	Thy will be done,
MAT.6.10	On earth as it is in heaven.
MAT.6.11	Give us this day our daily bread;
MAT.6.12	And forgive us our debts,
MAT.6.12	As we also have forgiven our debtors;
MAT.6.13	But deliver us from evil.
MAT.6.15	but if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
MAT.6.17	But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, 
MAT.6.18	 that your fasting may not be seen by men but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
MAT.6.20	but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust
MAT.6.21	For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
MAT.6.23	but if your eye is not sound, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
MAT.6.26	 Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? 
MAT.6.27	 And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his span of life?
MAT.6.28	And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; 
MAT.6.29	 yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 
MAT.6.30	 But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O men of little faith? 
MAT.6.31	Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ 
MAT.6.32	For the Gentiles seek all these things; and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. 
MAT.6.33	 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well.
MAT.6.34	“Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Let the day's own trouble be sufficient for the day.
MAT.7.2	For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and the measure you give will be the measure you get. 
MAT.7.3	 Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? 
MAT.7.4	Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when there is the log in your own eye? 
MAT.7.5	You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.
MAT.7.6	“Do not give dogs what is holy; and do not throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under foot and turn to attack you.
MAT.7.8	For every one who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. 
MAT.7.9	Or what man of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? 
MAT.7.10	Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? 
MAT.7.11	If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him! 
MAT.7.12	 So whatever you wish that men would do to you, do so to them; for this is the law and the prophets.
MAT.7.14	For the gate is narrow and the way is hard, that leads to life, and those who find it are few.
MAT.7.16	 You will know them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles? 
MAT.7.17	So, every sound tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears evil fruit. 
MAT.7.18	A sound tree cannot bear evil fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. 
MAT.7.19	Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 
MAT.7.20	Thus you will know them by their fruits.
MAT.7.22	 On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ 
MAT.7.23	And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you evildoers.’
MAT.7.25	and the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. 
MAT.7.26	And every one who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house upon the sand; 
MAT.7.27	and the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell; and great was the fall of it.”
MAT.7.29	for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.
MAT.8.1	When he came down from the mountain, great crowds followed him; 
MAT.8.3	And he stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, “I will; be clean.” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. 
MAT.8.4	 And Jesus said to him, “See that you say nothing to any one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a proof to the people.”
MAT.8.6	and saying, “Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, in terrible distress.” 
MAT.8.7	And he said to him, “I will come and heal him.” 
MAT.8.8	But the centurion answered him, “Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant will be healed. 
MAT.8.9	For I am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” 
MAT.8.10	When Jesus heard him, he marveled, and said to those who followed him, “Truly, I say to you, not even
MAT.8.11	 I tell you, many will come from east and west and sit at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, 
MAT.8.12	 while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.” 
MAT.8.13	And to the centurion Jesus said, “Go; be it done for you as you have believed.” And the servant was healed at that very moment.
MAT.8.15	he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she rose and served him. 
MAT.8.16	That evening they brought to him many who were possessed with demons; and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick. 
MAT.8.17	 This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, “He took our infirmities and bore our diseases.”
MAT.8.19	And a scribe came up and said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.” 
MAT.8.20	And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.” 
MAT.8.21	Another of the disciples said to him, “Lord, let me first go and bury my father.” 
MAT.8.22	 But Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.”
MAT.8.24	And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but he was asleep. 
MAT.8.25	And they went and woke him, saying, “Save, Lord; we are perishing.” 
MAT.8.26	 And he said to them, “Why are you afraid, O men of little faith?” Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm. 
MAT.8.27	And the men marveled, saying, “What sort of man is this, that even winds and sea obey him?”
MAT.8.29	 And behold, they cried out, “What have you to do with us, O Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?” 
MAT.8.30	Now a herd of many swine was feeding at some distance from them. 
MAT.8.31	And the demons begged him, “If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine.” 
MAT.8.32	And he said to them, “Go.” So they came out and went into the swine; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and perished in the waters. 
MAT.8.33	The herdsmen fled, and going into the city they told everything, and what had happened to the demoniacs. 
MAT.8.34	And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw him, they begged him to leave their neighborhood.
MAT.9.2	 And behold, they brought to him a paralytic, lying on his bed; and when Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic, “Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven.” 
MAT.9.3	And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming.” 
MAT.9.4	But Jesus, knowing
MAT.9.5	For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise and walk’? 
MAT.9.6	But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he then said to the paralytic—“Rise, take up your bed and go home.” 
MAT.9.7	And he rose and went home. 
MAT.9.8	When the crowds saw it, they were afraid, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to men.
MAT.9.10	And as he sat at table
MAT.9.11	And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” 
MAT.9.12	But when he heard it, he said, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. 
MAT.9.13	 Go and learn what this means, ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.”
MAT.9.15	And Jesus said to them, “Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come, when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast. 
MAT.9.16	And no one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch tears away from the garment, and a worse tear is made. 
MAT.9.17	Neither is new wine put into old wineskins; if it is, the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins are destroyed; but new wine is put into fresh wineskins, and so both are preserved.”
MAT.9.19	And Jesus rose and followed him, with his disciples. 
MAT.9.20	 And behold, a woman who had suffered from a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment; 
MAT.9.21	for she said to herself, “If I only touch his garment, I shall be made well.” 
MAT.9.22	 Jesus turned, and seeing her he said, “Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well.” And instantly the woman was made well. 
MAT.9.23	And when Jesus came to the ruler's house, and saw the flute players, and the crowd making a tumult, 
MAT.9.24	he said, “Depart; for the girl is not dead but sleeping.” And they laughed at him. 
MAT.9.25	But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose. 
MAT.9.26	And the report of this went through all that district.
MAT.9.28	When he entered the house, the blind men came to him; and Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They said to him, “Yes, Lord.” 
MAT.9.29	Then he touched their eyes, saying, “According to your faith be it done to you.” 
MAT.9.30	And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly charged them, “See that no one knows it.” 
MAT.9.31	But they went away and spread his fame through all that district.
MAT.9.33	And when the demon had been cast out, the dumb man spoke; and the crowds marveled, saying, “Never was anything like this seen in Israel.” 
MAT.9.34	But the Pharisees said, “He casts out demons by the prince of demons.”
MAT.9.36	 When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. 
MAT.9.37	 Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; 
MAT.9.38	pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.”
MAT.10.2	The names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; 
MAT.10.3	Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
MAT.10.4	Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
MAT.10.6	 but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 
MAT.10.7	 And preach as you go, saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand.’ 
MAT.10.8	Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. You received without paying, give without pay. 
MAT.10.9	 Take no gold, nor silver, nor copper in your belts, 
MAT.10.10	 no bag for your journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff; for the laborer deserves his food. 
MAT.10.11	And whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy in it, and stay with him until you depart. 
MAT.10.12	As you enter the house, salute it. 
MAT.10.13	And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. 
MAT.10.14	 And if any one will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town. 
MAT.10.15	 Truly, I say to you, it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.
MAT.10.17	 Beware of men; for they will deliver you up to councils, and flog you in their synagogues, 
MAT.10.18	 and you will be dragged before governors and kings for my sake, to bear testimony before them and the Gentiles. 
MAT.10.19	When they deliver you up, do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour; 
MAT.10.20	 for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. 
MAT.10.21	 Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death; 
MAT.10.22	 and you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved. 
MAT.10.23	 When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next; for truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel, before the Son of man comes.
MAT.10.25	 it is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant
MAT.10.27	What I tell you in the dark, utter in the light; and what you hear whispered, proclaim upon the housetops. 
MAT.10.28	 And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
MAT.10.29	Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father's will. 
MAT.10.30	But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. 
MAT.10.31	 Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. 
MAT.10.32	 So every one who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven; 
MAT.10.33	but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven.
MAT.10.35	For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; 
MAT.10.36	and a man's foes will be those of his own household. 
MAT.10.37	 He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; 
MAT.10.38	and he who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. 
MAT.10.39	He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.
MAT.10.41	He who receives a prophet because he is a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward, and he who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. 
MAT.10.42	 And whoever gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.”
MAT.11.3	 and said to him, “Are you he who is to come, or shall we look for another?” 
MAT.11.4	And Jesus answered them, “Go and tell John what you hear and see: 
MAT.11.5	 the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. 
MAT.11.6	And blessed is he who takes no offense at me.”
MAT.11.7	As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to behold? A reed shaken by the wind? 
MAT.11.8	Why then did you go out? To see a man
MAT.11.9	 Why then did you go out? To see a prophet?
MAT.11.10	 This is he of whom it is written,
MAT.11.10	‘Behold, I send my messenger before thy face,
MAT.11.10	who shall prepare thy way before thee.’
MAT.11.11	Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has risen no one greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. 
MAT.11.12	 From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence,
MAT.11.13	For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John; 
MAT.11.14	 and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come. 
MAT.11.15	 He who has ears to hear,
MAT.11.17	‘We piped to you, and you did not dance;
MAT.11.17	we wailed, and you did not mourn.’
MAT.11.18	For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon’; 
MAT.11.19	the Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Behold, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds.”
MAT.11.21	“Woe to you, Chorazin! woe to you, Beth-saida! for if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 
MAT.11.22	But I tell you, it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you. 
MAT.11.23	And you, Caperna-um, will you be exalted to heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. 
MAT.11.24	 But I tell you that it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you.”
MAT.11.26	yea, Father, for such was thy gracious will.
MAT.11.27	 All things have been delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. 
MAT.11.28	Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 
MAT.11.29	 Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 
MAT.11.30	For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”
MAT.12.2	But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, “Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the sabbath.” 
MAT.12.3	 He said to them, “Have you not read what David did, when he was hungry, and those who were with him: 
MAT.12.4	how he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests? 
MAT.12.5	 Or have you not read in the law how on the sabbath the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are guiltless? 
MAT.12.6	 I tell you, something greater than the temple is here. 
MAT.12.7	 And if you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the guiltless. 
MAT.12.8	 For the Son of man is lord of the sabbath.”
MAT.12.10	And behold, there was a man with a withered hand. And they asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath?” so that they might accuse him. 
MAT.12.11	 He said to them, “What man of you, if he has one sheep and it falls into a pit on the sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift it out? 
MAT.12.12	 Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the sabbath.” 
MAT.12.13	Then he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And the man stretched it out, and it was restored, whole like the other. 
MAT.12.14	 But the Pharisees went out and took counsel against him, how to destroy him.
MAT.12.16	and ordered them not to make him known. 
MAT.12.17	This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:
MAT.12.18	my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased.
MAT.12.18	I will put my Spirit upon him,
MAT.12.18	and he shall proclaim justice to the Gentiles.
MAT.12.19	He will not wrangle or cry aloud,
MAT.12.19	nor will any one hear his voice in the streets;
MAT.12.20	he will not break a bruised reed
MAT.12.20	or quench a smoldering wick,
MAT.12.20	till he brings justice to victory;
MAT.12.21	and in his name will the Gentiles hope.”
MAT.12.23	And all the people were amazed, and said, “Can this be the Son of David?” 
MAT.12.24	 But when the Pharisees heard it they said, “It is only by Be-elzebul, the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons.” 
MAT.12.25	Knowing their thoughts, he said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand; 
MAT.12.26	and if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand? 
MAT.12.27	And if I cast out demons by Be-elzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges. 
MAT.12.28	But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. 
MAT.12.29	Or how can one enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house. 
MAT.12.30	 He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters. 
MAT.12.31	 Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. 
MAT.12.32	And whoever says a word against the Son of man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.
MAT.12.34	You brood of vipers! how can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. 
MAT.12.35	The good man out of his good treasure brings forth good, and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings forth evil. 
MAT.12.36	I tell you, on the day of judgment men will render account for every careless word they utter; 
MAT.12.37	for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”
MAT.12.39	But he answered them, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign; but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. 
MAT.12.40	 For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. 
MAT.12.41	 The men of Nineveh will arise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here. 
MAT.12.42	 The queen of the South will arise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.
MAT.12.44	Then he says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’ And when he comes he finds it empty, swept, and put in order. 
MAT.12.45	Then he goes and brings with him seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So shall it be also with this evil generation.”
MAT.12.48	But he replied to the man who told him, “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?” 
MAT.12.49	And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers! 
MAT.12.50	 For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother, and sister, and mother.”
MAT.13.2	And great crowds gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat there; and the whole crowd stood on the beach. 
MAT.13.3	And he told them many things in parables, saying: “A sower went out to sow. 
MAT.13.4	And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them. 
MAT.13.5	Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they had not much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil, 
MAT.13.6	but when the sun rose they were scorched; and since they had no root they withered away. 
MAT.13.7	Other seeds fell upon thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. 
MAT.13.8	Other seeds fell on good soil and brought forth grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. 
MAT.13.9	He who has ears,
MAT.13.11	And he answered them, “To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. 
MAT.13.12	 For to him who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away. 
MAT.13.13	This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. 
MAT.13.14	 With them indeed is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says:
MAT.13.14	‘You shall indeed hear but never understand,
MAT.13.14	and you shall indeed see but never perceive.
MAT.13.15	For this people's heart has grown dull,
MAT.13.15	and their ears are heavy of hearing,
MAT.13.15	and their eyes they have closed,
MAT.13.15	lest they should perceive with their eyes,
MAT.13.15	and hear with their ears,
MAT.13.15	and understand with their heart,
MAT.13.15	and turn for me to heal them.’
MAT.13.17	Truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.
MAT.13.19	When any one hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in his heart; this is what was sown along the path. 
MAT.13.20	As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy; 
MAT.13.21	yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away.
MAT.13.22	 As for what was sown among thorns, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the delight in riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. 
MAT.13.23	As for what was sown on good soil, this is he who hears the word and understands it; he indeed bears fruit, and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.”
MAT.13.25	but while men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. 
MAT.13.26	So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also. 
MAT.13.27	And the servants
MAT.13.28	He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’ The servants
MAT.13.29	But he said, ‘No; lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them. 
MAT.13.30	Let both grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.’ ”
MAT.13.32	it is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.”
MAT.13.35	 This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet:
MAT.13.35	“I will open my mouth in parables,
MAT.13.35	I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world.”
MAT.13.36	Then he left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.” 
MAT.13.37	He answered, “He who sows the good seed is the Son of man; 
MAT.13.38	 the field is the world, and the good seed means the sons of the kingdom; the weeds are the sons of the evil one, 
MAT.13.39	and the enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the close of the age, and the reapers are angels. 
MAT.13.40	Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the close of the age. 
MAT.13.41	 The Son of man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers, 
MAT.13.42	 and throw them into the furnace of fire; there men will weep and gnash their teeth. 
MAT.13.43	Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.
MAT.13.44	“The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up; then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
MAT.13.45	“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, 
MAT.13.46	who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it.
MAT.13.48	when it was full, men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into vessels but threw away the bad. 
MAT.13.49	So it will be at the close of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous, 
MAT.13.50	and throw them into the furnace of fire; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.
MAT.13.51	“Have you understood all this?” They said to him, “Yes.” 
MAT.13.52	And he said to them, “Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.”
MAT.13.54	 and coming to his own country he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works? 
MAT.13.55	Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? 
MAT.13.56	And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all this?” 
MAT.13.57	And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.” 
MAT.13.58	And he did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.
MAT.14.2	and he said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist, he has been raised from the dead; that is why these powers are at work in him.” 
MAT.14.3	 For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison, for the sake of Herodi-as, his brother Philip's wife;
MAT.14.4	because John said to him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.” 
MAT.14.5	 And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet. 
MAT.14.6	But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodi-as danced before the company, and pleased Herod, 
MAT.14.7	so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask. 
MAT.14.8	Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.” 
MAT.14.9	And the king was sorry; but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given; 
MAT.14.10	he sent and had John beheaded in the prison, 
MAT.14.11	and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. 
MAT.14.12	And his disciples came and took the body and buried it; and they went and told Jesus.
MAT.14.14	As he went ashore he saw a great throng; and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick. 
MAT.14.15	When it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, “This is a lonely place, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves.” 
MAT.14.16	Jesus said, “They need not go away; you give them something to eat.” 
MAT.14.17	They said to him, “We have only five loaves here and two fish.” 
MAT.14.18	And he said, “Bring them here to me.” 
MAT.14.19	 Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass; and taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. 
MAT.14.20	And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over. 
MAT.14.21	And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
MAT.14.23	And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone, 
MAT.14.24	 but the boat by this time was many furlongs distant from the land,
MAT.14.25	And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. 
MAT.14.26	 But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, “It is a ghost!” and they cried out for fear. 
MAT.14.27	But immediately he spoke to them, saying, “Take heart, it is I; have no fear.”
MAT.14.28	And Peter answered him, “Lord, if it is you, bid me come to you on the water.” 
MAT.14.29	 He said, “Come.” So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus; 
MAT.14.30	but when he saw the wind,
MAT.14.31	 Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, saying to him, “O man of little faith, why did you doubt?” 
MAT.14.32	And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased. 
MAT.14.33	 And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”
MAT.14.35	And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent round to all that region and brought to him all that were sick, 
MAT.14.36	 and besought him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched it were made well.
MAT.15.2	“Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat.” 
MAT.15.3	He answered them, “And why do you transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition? 
MAT.15.4	 For God commanded, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him surely die.’ 
MAT.15.5	But you say, ‘If any one tells his father or his mother, What you would have gained from me is given to God,
MAT.15.6	So, for the sake of your tradition, you have made void the word
MAT.15.7	You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, when he said:
MAT.15.8	but their heart is far from me;
MAT.15.9	in vain do they worship me,
MAT.15.9	teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.’ ”
MAT.15.10	And he called the people to him and said to them, “Hear and understand: 
MAT.15.11	 not what goes into the mouth defiles a man, but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.” 
MAT.15.12	Then the disciples came and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?” 
MAT.15.13	 He answered, “Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up. 
MAT.15.14	 Let them alone; they are blind guides. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.” 
MAT.15.15	But Peter said to him, “Explain the parable to us.” 
MAT.15.16	And he said, “Are you also still without understanding? 
MAT.15.17	Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach, and so passes on?
MAT.15.18	But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a man. 
MAT.15.19	 For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander. 
MAT.15.20	These are what defile a man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.”
MAT.15.22	And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and cried, “Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely possessed by a demon.” 
MAT.15.23	But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away, for she is crying after us.” 
MAT.15.24	 He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” 
MAT.15.25	 But she came and knelt before him, saying, “Lord, help me.” 
MAT.15.26	And he answered, “It is not fair to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.” 
MAT.15.27	She said, “Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table.” 
MAT.15.28	 Then Jesus answered her, “O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire.” And her daughter was healed instantly.
MAT.15.30	And great crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the maimed, the blind, the dumb, and many others, and they put them at his feet, and he healed them, 
MAT.15.31	so that the throng wondered, when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.
MAT.15.33	And the disciples said to him, “Where are we to get bread enough in the desert to feed so great a crowd?” 
MAT.15.34	And Jesus said to them, “How many loaves have you?” They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.” 
MAT.15.35	And commanding the crowd to sit down on the ground, 
MAT.15.36	he took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. 
MAT.15.37	And they all ate and were satisfied; and they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left over. 
MAT.15.38	Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. 
MAT.15.39	And sending away the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
MAT.16.2	He answered them,
MAT.16.3	And in the morning, ‘It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and threatening.’ You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times. 
MAT.16.4	 An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah.” So he left them and departed.
MAT.16.6	 Jesus said to them, “Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” 
MAT.16.7	And they discussed it among themselves, saying, “We brought no bread.” 
MAT.16.8	 But Jesus, aware of this, said, “O men of little faith, why do you discuss among yourselves the fact that you have no bread? 
MAT.16.9	 Do you not yet perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered? 
MAT.16.10	 Or the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered? 
MAT.16.11	How is it that you fail to perceive that I did not speak about bread? Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” 
MAT.16.12	Then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
MAT.16.14	 And they said, “Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” 
MAT.16.15	He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” 
MAT.16.16	 Simon Peter replied, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” 
MAT.16.17	 And Jesus answered him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jona! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. 
MAT.16.18	 And I tell you, you are Peter,
MAT.16.19	 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” 
MAT.16.20	 Then he strictly charged the disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.
MAT.16.22	And Peter took him and began to rebuke him, saying, “God forbid, Lord! This shall never happen to you.” 
MAT.16.23	 But he turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance
MAT.16.25	For whoever would save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. 
MAT.16.26	For what will it profit a man, if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life? Or what shall a man give in return for his life? 
MAT.16.27	 For the Son of man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay every man for what he has done. 
MAT.16.28	 Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.”
MAT.17.2	And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his garments became white as light. 
MAT.17.3	And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him. 
MAT.17.4	And Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is well that we are here; if you wish, I will make three booths here, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.” 
MAT.17.5	 He was still speaking, when lo, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my beloved Son,
MAT.17.6	When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces, and were filled with awe. 
MAT.17.7	But Jesus came and touched them, saying, “Rise, and have no fear.” 
MAT.17.8	And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.
MAT.17.10	 And the disciples asked him, “Then why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?” 
MAT.17.11	He replied, “Elijah does come, and he is to restore all things; 
MAT.17.12	 but I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not know him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son of man will suffer at their hands.” 
MAT.17.13	Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.
MAT.17.15	“Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is an epileptic and he suffers terribly; for often he falls into the fire, and often into the water. 
MAT.17.16	And I brought him to your disciples, and they could not heal him.” 
MAT.17.17	And Jesus answered, “O faithless and perverse generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him here to me.” 
MAT.17.18	And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him, and the boy was cured instantly. 
MAT.17.19	 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, “Why could we not cast it out?” 
MAT.17.20	 He said to them, “Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.” 
MAT.17.23	and they will kill him, and he will be raised on the third day.” And they were greatly distressed.
MAT.17.25	 He said, “Yes.” And when he came home, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do kings of the earth take toll or tribute? From their sons or from others?” 
MAT.17.26	And when he said, “From others,” Jesus said to him, “Then the sons are free. 
MAT.17.27	 However, not to give offense to them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth you will find a shekel; take that and give it to them for me and for yourself.”
MAT.18.2	And calling to him a child, he put him in the midst of them, 
MAT.18.3	 and said, “Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.18.4	Whoever humbles himself like this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
MAT.18.6	 but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin,
MAT.18.7	“Woe to the world for temptations to sin!
MAT.18.8	 And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin,
MAT.18.9	And if your eye causes you to sin,
MAT.18.12	 What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray? 
MAT.18.13	And if he finds it, truly, I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray. 
MAT.18.14	So it is not the will of my
MAT.18.16	But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses. 
MAT.18.17	If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. 
MAT.18.18	 Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. 
MAT.18.19	 Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. 
MAT.18.20	For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them.”
MAT.18.22	Jesus said to him, “I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven.
MAT.18.24	When he began the reckoning, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents;
MAT.18.25	 and as he could not pay, his lord ordered him to be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made. 
MAT.18.26	 So the servant fell on his knees, imploring him, ‘Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.’ 
MAT.18.27	And out of pity for him the lord of that servant released him and forgave him the debt. 
MAT.18.28	But that same servant, as he went out, came upon one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii;
MAT.18.29	So his fellow servant fell down and besought him, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you.’ 
MAT.18.30	He refused and went and put him in prison till he should pay the debt. 
MAT.18.31	When his fellow servants saw what had taken place, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place. 
MAT.18.32	Then his lord summoned him and said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you besought me; 
MAT.18.33	and should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?’ 
MAT.18.34	And in anger his lord delivered him to the jailers,
MAT.18.35	 So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.”
MAT.19.2	and large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.
MAT.19.3	And Pharisees came up to him and tested him by asking, “Is it lawful to divorce one's wife for any cause?” 
MAT.19.4	He answered, “Have you not read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female, 
MAT.19.5	 and said, ‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’? 
MAT.19.6	So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder.” 
MAT.19.7	 They said to him, “Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?” 
MAT.19.8	He said to them, “For your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. 
MAT.19.9	 And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for unchastity,
MAT.19.10	The disciples said to him, “If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.” 
MAT.19.11	 But he said to them, “Not all men can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given. 
MAT.19.12	For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it.”
MAT.19.14	but Jesus said, “Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.” 
MAT.19.15	And he laid his hands on them and went away.
MAT.19.17	And he said to him, “Why do you ask me about what is good? One there is who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments.” 
MAT.19.18	 He said to him, “Which?” And Jesus said, “You shall not kill, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, 
MAT.19.19	 Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” 
MAT.19.20	The young man said to him, “All these I have observed; what do I still lack?” 
MAT.19.21	 Jesus said to him, “If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” 
MAT.19.22	When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions.
MAT.19.24	Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.” 
MAT.19.25	When the disciples heard this they were greatly astonished, saying, “Who then can be saved?” 
MAT.19.26	 But Jesus looked at them and said to them, “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.” 
MAT.19.27	 Then Peter said in reply, “Lo, we have left everything and followed you. What then shall we have?” 
MAT.19.28	 Jesus said to them, “Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of man shall sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 
MAT.19.29	And every one who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name's sake, will receive a hundredfold,
MAT.19.30	 But many that are first will be last, and the last first.
MAT.20.2	After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius
MAT.20.3	And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the market place; 
MAT.20.4	and to them he said, ‘You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you.’ So they went. 
MAT.20.5	Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, he did the same. 
MAT.20.6	And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing; and he said to them, ‘Why do you stand here idle all day?’ 
MAT.20.7	They said to him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You go into the vineyard too.’ 
MAT.20.8	 And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, ‘Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first.’ 
MAT.20.9	And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, each of them received a denarius. 
MAT.20.10	Now when the first came, they thought they would receive more; but each of them also received a denarius. 
MAT.20.11	And on receiving it they grumbled at the householder, 
MAT.20.12	saying, ‘These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.’ 
MAT.20.13	 But he replied to one of them, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for a denarius? 
MAT.20.14	Take what belongs to you, and go; I choose to give to this last as I give to you. 
MAT.20.15	 Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or do you begrudge my generosity?’
MAT.20.16	 So the last will be first, and the first last.”
MAT.20.18	“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death, 
MAT.20.19	and deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified, and he will be raised on the third day.”
MAT.20.21	 And he said to her, “What do you want?” She said to him, “Command that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.” 
MAT.20.22	 But Jesus answered, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am to drink?” They said to him, “We are able.” 
MAT.20.23	 He said to them, “You will drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.” 
MAT.20.24	And when the ten heard it, they were indignant at the two brothers. 
MAT.20.25	 But Jesus called them to him and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them. 
MAT.20.26	 It shall not be so among you; but whoever would be great among you must be your servant, 
MAT.20.27	and whoever would be first among you must be your slave; 
MAT.20.28	 even as the Son of man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”
MAT.20.30	And behold, two blind men sitting by the roadside, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out,
MAT.20.31	The crowd rebuked them, telling them to be silent; but they cried out the more, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!” 
MAT.20.32	And Jesus stopped and called them, saying, “What do you want me to do for you?” 
MAT.20.33	They said to him, “Lord, let our eyes be opened.” 
MAT.20.34	And Jesus in pity touched their eyes, and immediately they received their sight and followed him.
MAT.21.2	saying to them, “Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find an ass tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me. 
MAT.21.3	If any one says anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord has need of them,’ and he will send them immediately.” 
MAT.21.4	This took place to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet, saying,
MAT.21.5	Behold, your king is coming to you,
MAT.21.5	humble, and mounted on an ass,
MAT.21.5	and on a colt, the foal of an ass.”
MAT.21.6	The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them; 
MAT.21.7	they brought the ass and the colt, and put their garments on them, and he sat thereon. 
MAT.21.8	 Most of the crowd spread their garments on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. 
MAT.21.9	 And the crowds that went before him and that followed him shouted, “Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!” 
MAT.21.10	And when he entered Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, “Who is this?” 
MAT.21.11	 And the crowds said, “This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee.”
MAT.21.13	 He said to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer’; but you make it a den of robbers.”
MAT.21.14	And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them. 
MAT.21.15	 But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying out in the temple, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” they were indignant; 
MAT.21.16	 and they said to him, “Do you hear what these are saying?” And Jesus said to them, “Yes; have you never read,
MAT.21.16	‘Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings
MAT.21.16	thou hast brought perfect praise’?”
MAT.21.18	In the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was hungry. 
MAT.21.19	And seeing a fig tree by the wayside he went to it, and found nothing on it but leaves only. And he said to it, “May no fruit ever come from you again!” And the fig tree withered at once. 
MAT.21.20	 When the disciples saw it they marveled, saying, “How did the fig tree wither at once?” 
MAT.21.21	 And Jesus answered them, “Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and never doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ it will be done. 
MAT.21.22	 And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith.”
MAT.21.24	Jesus answered them, “I also will ask you a question; and if you tell me the answer, then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things. 
MAT.21.25	The baptism of John, whence was it? From heaven or from men?” And they argued with one another, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say to us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ 
MAT.21.26	 But if we say, ‘From men,’ we are afraid of the multitude; for all hold that John was a prophet.” 
MAT.21.27	So they answered Jesus, “We do not know.” And he said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
MAT.21.29	And he answered, ‘I will not’; but afterward he repented and went. 
MAT.21.30	And he went to the second and said the same; and he answered, ‘I go, sir,’ but did not go. 
MAT.21.31	Which of the two did the will of his father?” They said, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. 
MAT.21.32	 For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him; and even when you saw it, you did not afterward repent and believe him.
MAT.21.34	 When the season of fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, to get his fruit; 
MAT.21.35	and the tenants took his servants and beat one, killed another, and stoned another. 
MAT.21.36	Again he sent other servants, more than the first; and they did the same to them. 
MAT.21.37	Afterward he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ 
MAT.21.38	But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, ‘This is the heir; come, let us kill him and have his inheritance.’ 
MAT.21.39	And they took him and cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. 
MAT.21.40	When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?” 
MAT.21.41	 They said to him, “He will put those wretches to a miserable death, and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons.”
MAT.21.42	‘The very stone which the builders rejected
MAT.21.42	has become the head of the corner;
MAT.21.42	this was the Lord's doing,
MAT.21.42	and it is marvelous in our eyes’?
MAT.21.43	Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation producing the fruits of it.” 
MAT.21.45	When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he was speaking about them. 
MAT.21.46	But when they tried to arrest him, they feared the multitudes, because they held him to be a prophet.
MAT.22.2	“The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a marriage feast for his son, 
MAT.22.3	 and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast; but they would not come. 
MAT.22.4	Again he sent other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, Behold, I have made ready my dinner, my oxen and my fat calves are killed, and everything is ready; come to the marriage feast.’ 
MAT.22.5	But they made light of it and went off, one to his farm, another to his business, 
MAT.22.6	while the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them. 
MAT.22.7	The king was angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. 
MAT.22.8	Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding is ready, but those invited were not worthy. 
MAT.22.9	Go therefore to the thoroughfares, and invite to the marriage feast as many as you find.’ 
MAT.22.10	 And those servants went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good; so the wedding hall was filled with guests.
MAT.22.11	“But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man who had no wedding garment; 
MAT.22.12	 and he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?’ And he was speechless. 
MAT.22.13	 Then the king said to the attendants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, and cast him into the outer darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.’ 
MAT.22.14	For many are called, but few are chosen.”
MAT.22.16	And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodi-ans, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God truthfully, and care for no man; for you do not regard the position of men. 
MAT.22.17	Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?” 
MAT.22.18	But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, “Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? 
MAT.22.19	Show me the money for the tax.” And they brought him a coin.
MAT.22.20	And Jesus said to them, “Whose likeness and inscription is this?” 
MAT.22.21	 They said, “Caesar's.” Then he said to them, “Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.” 
MAT.22.22	When they heard it, they marveled; and they left him and went away.
MAT.22.24	 saying, “Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies, having no children, his brother must marry the widow, and raise up children for his brother.’ 
MAT.22.25	Now there were seven brothers among us; the first married, and died, and having no children left his wife to his brother. 
MAT.22.26	So too the second and third, down to the seventh. 
MAT.22.27	After them all, the woman died. 
MAT.22.28	In the resurrection, therefore, to which of the seven will she be wife? For they all had her.”
MAT.22.29	But Jesus answered them, “You are wrong, because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God. 
MAT.22.30	For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels
MAT.22.31	And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God, 
MAT.22.32	 ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not God of the dead, but of the living.” 
MAT.22.33	 And when the crowd heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.
MAT.22.35	 And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, to test him. 
MAT.22.36	“Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?” 
MAT.22.37	 And he said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. 
MAT.22.38	This is the great and first commandment. 
MAT.22.39	 And a second is like it, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. 
MAT.22.40	On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets.”
MAT.22.42	saying, “What do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?” They said to him, “The son of David.” 
MAT.22.43	He said to them, “How is it then that David, inspired by the Spirit,
MAT.22.44	Sit at my right hand,
MAT.22.44	till I put thy enemies under thy feet’?
MAT.22.45	If David thus calls him Lord, how is he his son?” 
MAT.22.46	 And no one was able to answer him a word, nor from that day did any one dare to ask him any more questions.
MAT.23.1	Then said Jesus to the crowds and to his disciples, 
MAT.23.2	“The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat; 
MAT.23.3	so practice and observe whatever they tell you, but not what they do; for they preach, but do not practice. 
MAT.23.4	 They bind heavy burdens, hard to bear,
MAT.23.5	 They do all their deeds to be seen by men; for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long, 
MAT.23.6	 and they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues, 
MAT.23.7	and salutations in the market places, and being called rabbi by men. 
MAT.23.8	 But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brethren. 
MAT.23.9	And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. 
MAT.23.10	Neither be called masters, for you have one master, the Christ. 
MAT.23.11	 He who is greatest among you shall be your servant; 
MAT.23.12	 whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
MAT.23.15	 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you traverse sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes a proselyte, you make him twice as much a child of hell
MAT.23.17	 You blind fools! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred? 
MAT.23.18	And you say, ‘If any one swears by the altar, it is nothing; but if any one swears by the gift that is on the altar, he is bound by his oath.’ 
MAT.23.19	You blind men! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred? 
MAT.23.20	So he who swears by the altar, swears by it and by everything on it; 
MAT.23.21	 and he who swears by the temple, swears by it and by him who dwells in it; 
MAT.23.22	and he who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by him who sits upon it.
MAT.23.24	You blind guides, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel!
MAT.23.26	You blind Pharisee! first cleanse the inside of the cup and of the plate, that the outside also may be clean.
MAT.23.28	So you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
MAT.23.30	saying, ‘If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’ 
MAT.23.31	Thus you witness against yourselves, that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. 
MAT.23.32	Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers. 
MAT.23.33	 You serpents, you brood of vipers, how are you to escape being sentenced to hell?
MAT.23.35	 that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of innocent Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. 
MAT.23.36	 Truly, I say to you, all this will come upon this generation.
MAT.23.38	 Behold, your house is forsaken and desolate.
MAT.23.39	 For I tell you, you will not see me again, until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.’ ”
MAT.24.2	 But he answered them, “You see all these, do you not? Truly, I say to you, there will not be left here one stone upon another, that will not be thrown down.”
MAT.24.4	And Jesus answered them, “Take heed that no one leads you astray. 
MAT.24.5	 For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will lead many astray. 
MAT.24.6	 And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that you are not alarmed; for this must take place, but the end is not yet. 
MAT.24.7	For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places: 
MAT.24.8	all this is but the beginning of the birth-pangs.
MAT.24.10	And then many will fall away,
MAT.24.11	And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. 
MAT.24.12	And because wickedness is multiplied, most men's love will grow cold. 
MAT.24.13	 But he who endures to the end will be saved. 
MAT.24.14	 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world, as a testimony to all nations; and then the end will come.
MAT.24.16	then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains; 
MAT.24.17	 let him who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house; 
MAT.24.18	and let him who is in the field not turn back to take his mantle. 
MAT.24.19	 And alas for those who are with child and for those who give suck in those days! 
MAT.24.20	Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a sabbath. 
MAT.24.21	 For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be. 
MAT.24.22	And if those days had not been shortened, no human being would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened. 
MAT.24.23	Then if any one says to you, ‘Lo, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There he is!’ do not believe it. 
MAT.24.24	For false Christs and false prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. 
MAT.24.25	Lo, I have told you beforehand. 
MAT.24.26	 So, if they say to you, ‘Lo, he is in the wilderness,’ do not go out; if they say, ‘Lo, he is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it. 
MAT.24.27	For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of man. 
MAT.24.28	 Wherever the body is, there the eagles
MAT.24.30	 then will appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory; 
MAT.24.31	 and he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
MAT.24.32	“From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near. 
MAT.24.33	So also, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, at the very gates. 
MAT.24.34	 Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away till all these things take place. 
MAT.24.35	 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
MAT.24.37	 As were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of man. 
MAT.24.38	For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, 
MAT.24.39	and they did not know until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of man. 
MAT.24.40	 Then two men will be in the field; one is taken and one is left. 
MAT.24.41	Two women will be grinding at the mill; one is taken and one is left. 
MAT.24.42	 Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. 
MAT.24.44	Therefore you also must be ready; for the Son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
MAT.24.46	Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes will find so doing. 
MAT.24.47	Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions. 
MAT.24.48	But if that wicked servant says to himself, ‘My master is delayed,’ 
MAT.24.49	 and begins to beat his fellow servants, and eats and drinks with the drunken, 
MAT.24.50	the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, 
MAT.24.51	 and will punish
MAT.25.2	 Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. 
MAT.25.3	For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them; 
MAT.25.4	but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. 
MAT.25.5	As the bridegroom was delayed, they all slumbered and slept. 
MAT.25.6	But at midnight there was a cry, ‘Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.’ 
MAT.25.7	Then all those maidens rose and trimmed their lamps. 
MAT.25.8	And the foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’ 
MAT.25.9	But the wise replied, ‘Perhaps there will not be enough for us and for you; go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.’ 
MAT.25.10	 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast; and the door was shut. 
MAT.25.11	 Afterward the other maidens came also, saying, ‘Lord, lord, open to us.’ 
MAT.25.12	But he replied, ‘Truly, I say to you, I do not know you.’ 
MAT.25.13	 Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.
MAT.25.15	to one he gave five talents,
MAT.25.16	He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them; and he made five talents more. 
MAT.25.17	So also, he who had the two talents made two talents more. 
MAT.25.18	But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. 
MAT.25.19	 Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. 
MAT.25.20	And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more.’ 
MAT.25.21	 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little, I will set you over much; enter into the joy of your master.’ 
MAT.25.22	And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more.’ 
MAT.25.23	His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little, I will set you over much; enter into the joy of your master.’ 
MAT.25.24	He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, ‘Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow; 
MAT.25.25	so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.’ 
MAT.25.26	But his master answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sowed, and gather where I have not winnowed? 
MAT.25.27	Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. 
MAT.25.28	So take the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents. 
MAT.25.29	 For to every one who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away. 
MAT.25.30	 And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.’
MAT.25.32	 Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate them one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats, 
MAT.25.33	and he will place the sheep at his right hand, but the goats at the left. 
MAT.25.34	 Then the King will say to those at his right hand, ‘Come, O blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; 
MAT.25.35	 for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, 
MAT.25.36	I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.’ 
MAT.25.37	Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see thee hungry and feed thee, or thirsty and give thee drink? 
MAT.25.38	And when did we see thee a stranger and welcome thee, or naked and clothe thee? 
MAT.25.39	And when did we see thee sick or in prison and visit thee?’ 
MAT.25.40	 And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me.’ 
MAT.25.41	 Then he will say to those at his left hand, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels; 
MAT.25.42	for I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, 
MAT.25.43	I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’ 
MAT.25.44	Then they also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see thee hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to thee?’ 
MAT.25.45	Then he will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it not to one of the least of these, you did it not to me.’ 
MAT.25.46	 And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”
MAT.26.2	 “You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of man will be delivered up to be crucified.”
MAT.26.3	Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, 
MAT.26.4	and took counsel together in order to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him. 
MAT.26.5	But they said, “Not during the feast, lest there be a tumult among the people.”
MAT.26.7	a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head, as he sat at table. 
MAT.26.8	But when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, “Why this waste? 
MAT.26.9	For this ointment might have been sold for a large sum, and given to the poor.” 
MAT.26.10	But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, “Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me. 
MAT.26.11	 For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me. 
MAT.26.12	 In pouring this ointment on my body she has done it to prepare me for burial. 
MAT.26.13	Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her.”
MAT.26.15	 and said, “What will you give me if I deliver him to you?” And they paid him thirty pieces of silver. 
MAT.26.16	And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him.
MAT.26.18	 He said, “Go into the city to a certain one, and say to him, ‘The Teacher says, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at your house with my disciples.’ ” 
MAT.26.19	 And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the passover.
MAT.26.21	and as they were eating, he said, “Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.” 
MAT.26.22	And they were very sorrowful, and began to say to him one after another, “Is it I, Lord?” 
MAT.26.23	He answered, “He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me, will betray me. 
MAT.26.24	 The Son of man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.” 
MAT.26.25	Judas, who betrayed him, said, “Is it I, Master?”
MAT.26.27	And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, “Drink of it, all of you; 
MAT.26.28	 for this is my blood of the
MAT.26.29	I tell you I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.”
MAT.26.31	 Then Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away because of me this night; for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’ 
MAT.26.32	 But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.” 
MAT.26.33	Peter declared to him, “Though they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away.” 
MAT.26.34	Jesus said to him, “Truly, I say to you, this very night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.” 
MAT.26.35	Peter said to him, “Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.” And so said all the disciples.
MAT.26.37	And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled. 
MAT.26.38	 Then he said to them, “My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch
MAT.26.39	 And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, “My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.” 
MAT.26.40	And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter, “So, could you not watch
MAT.26.41	 Watch
MAT.26.42	 Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, “My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, thy will be done.” 
MAT.26.43	And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. 
MAT.26.44	So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words. 
MAT.26.45	 Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 
MAT.26.46	Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.”
MAT.26.48	Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “The one I shall kiss is the man; seize him.” 
MAT.26.49	And he came up to Jesus at once and said, “Hail, Master!”
MAT.26.50	 Jesus said to him, “Friend, why are you here?”
MAT.26.51	And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest, and cut off his ear. 
MAT.26.52	 Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword. 
MAT.26.53	Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? 
MAT.26.54	But how then should the scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?” 
MAT.26.55	 At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. 
MAT.26.56	But all this has taken place, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.
MAT.26.58	But Peter followed him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and going inside he sat with the guards to see the end. 
MAT.26.59	Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death, 
MAT.26.60	but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward 
MAT.26.61	 and said, “This fellow said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.’ ” 
MAT.26.62	And the high priest stood up and said, “Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?” 
MAT.26.63	 But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him, “I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.” 
MAT.26.64	 Jesus said to him, “You have said so. But I tell you, hereafter you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.” 
MAT.26.65	 Then the high priest tore his robes, and said, “He has uttered blasphemy. Why do we still need witnesses? You have now heard his blasphemy. 
MAT.26.66	What is your judgment?” They answered, “He deserves death.” 
MAT.26.67	Then they spat in his face, and struck him; and some slapped him, 
MAT.26.68	saying, “Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you?”
MAT.26.69	Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a maid came up to him, and said, “You also were with Jesus the Galilean.” 
MAT.26.70	But he denied it before them all, saying, “I do not know what you mean.” 
MAT.26.71	And when he went out to the porch, another maid saw him, and she said to the bystanders, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.” 
MAT.26.72	And again he denied it with an oath, “I do not know the man.” 
MAT.26.73	After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, “Certainly you are also one of them, for your accent betrays you.” 
MAT.26.74	Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, “I do not know the man.” And immediately the cock crowed. 
MAT.26.75	 And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, “Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.” And he went out and wept bitterly.
MAT.27.2	and they bound him and led him away and delivered him to Pilate the governor.
MAT.27.4	saying, “I have sinned in betraying innocent blood.” They said, “What is that to us? See to it yourself.” 
MAT.27.5	And throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed; and he went and hanged himself. 
MAT.27.6	 But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, “It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since they are blood money.” 
MAT.27.7	So they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. 
MAT.27.8	Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. 
MAT.27.9	 Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, “And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel, 
MAT.27.10	and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me.”
MAT.27.12	But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer. 
MAT.27.13	Then Pilate said to him, “Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?” 
MAT.27.14	 But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge; so that the governor wondered greatly.
MAT.27.15	Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted. 
MAT.27.16	And they had then a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.
MAT.27.17	So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you, Barabbas
MAT.27.18	For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up. 
MAT.27.19	 Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much over him today in a dream.” 
MAT.27.20	Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the people to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. 
MAT.27.21	 The governor again said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said, “Barabbas.” 
MAT.27.22	Pilate said to them, “Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?” They all said, “Let him be crucified.” 
MAT.27.23	And he said, “Why, what evil has he done?” But they shouted all the more, “Let him be crucified.”
MAT.27.25	 And all the people answered, “His blood be on us and on our children!” 
MAT.27.26	Then he released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified.
MAT.27.28	And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe upon him, 
MAT.27.29	and plaiting a crown of thorns they put it on his head, and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him they mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” 
MAT.27.30	And they spat upon him, and took the reed and struck him on the head. 
MAT.27.31	And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.
MAT.27.33	 And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means the place of a skull), 
MAT.27.34	they offered him wine to drink, mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not drink it. 
MAT.27.35	 And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots; 
MAT.27.36	then they sat down and kept watch over him there. 
MAT.27.37	And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, “This is Jesus the King of the Jews.” 
MAT.27.38	Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left. 
MAT.27.39	 And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads 
MAT.27.40	 and saying, “You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.” 
MAT.27.41	So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying, 
MAT.27.42	“He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. 
MAT.27.43	He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him; for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’ ” 
MAT.27.44	And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way.
MAT.27.46	 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lama sabach-thani?” that is, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” 
MAT.27.47	And some of the bystanders hearing it said, “This man is calling Elijah.” 
MAT.27.48	 And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink. 
MAT.27.49	But the others said, “Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.”
MAT.27.50	And Jesus cried again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.
MAT.27.52	the tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, 
MAT.27.53	and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many. 
MAT.27.54	 When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe, and said, “Truly this was the Son
MAT.27.55	There were also many women there, looking on from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him; 
MAT.27.56	 among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
MAT.27.58	He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. 
MAT.27.59	And Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud, 
MAT.27.60	and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock; and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed. 
MAT.27.61	Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the sepulchre.
MAT.27.62	Next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate 
MAT.27.63	 and said, “Sir, we remember how that imposter said, while he was still alive, ‘After three days I will rise again.’ 
MAT.27.64	Therefore order the sepulchre to be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him away, and tell the people, ‘He has risen from the dead,’ and the last fraud will be worse than the first.” 
MAT.27.65	Pilate said to them, “You have a guard
MAT.27.66	 So they went and made the sepulchre secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard.
MAT.28.2	 And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone, and sat upon it. 
MAT.28.3	His appearance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow. 
MAT.28.4	 And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men. 
MAT.28.5	But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid; for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. 
MAT.28.6	He is not here; for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he
MAT.28.7	 Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. Lo, I have told you.” 
MAT.28.8	So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples. 
MAT.28.9	 And behold, Jesus met them and said, “Hail!” And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him. 
MAT.28.10	Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid; go and tell my brethren to go to Galilee, and there they will see me.”
MAT.28.12	And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sum of money to the soldiers 
MAT.28.13	and said, “Tell people, ‘His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.’ 
MAT.28.14	And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.” 
MAT.28.15	So they took the money and did as they were directed; and this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.
MAT.28.17	And when they saw him they worshiped him; but some doubted. 
MAT.28.18	 And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 
MAT.28.19	 Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 
MAT.28.20	 teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age.”
MRK.1.1	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
MRK.1.2	“Behold, I send my messenger before thy face,
MRK.1.2	who shall prepare thy way;
MRK.1.3	Prepare the way of the Lord,
MRK.1.3	make his paths straight—”
MRK.1.5	And there went out to him all the country of Judea, and all the people of Jerusalem; and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. 
MRK.1.6	Now John was clothed with camel's hair, and had a leather girdle around his waist, and ate locusts and wild honey. 
MRK.1.7	And he preached, saying, “After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. 
MRK.1.8	I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”
MRK.1.10	And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit descending upon him like a dove; 
MRK.1.11	 and a voice came from heaven, “Thou art my beloved Son;
MRK.1.13	And he was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to him.
MRK.1.15	and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe in the gospel.”
MRK.1.17	And Jesus said to them, “Follow me and I will make you become fishers of men.” 
MRK.1.18	And immediately they left their nets and followed him. 
MRK.1.19	And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets. 
MRK.1.20	And immediately he called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and followed him.
MRK.1.22	And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes. 
MRK.1.23	 And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; 
MRK.1.24	 and he cried out, “What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God.” 
MRK.1.25	But Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!” 
MRK.1.26	And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. 
MRK.1.27	And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching! With authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.” 
MRK.1.28	And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee.
MRK.1.30	Now Simon's mother-in-law lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him of her. 
MRK.1.31	And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her; and she served them.
MRK.1.33	And the whole city was gathered together about the door. 
MRK.1.34	And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.
MRK.1.36	And Simon and those who were with him pursued him, 
MRK.1.37	and they found him and said to him, “Every one is searching for you.” 
MRK.1.38	And he said to them, “Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also; for that is why I came out.” 
MRK.1.39	 And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.
MRK.1.41	Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him, “I will; be clean.” 
MRK.1.42	And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean. 
MRK.1.43	And he sternly charged him, and sent him away at once, 
MRK.1.44	 and said to him, “See that you say nothing to any one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to the people.”
MRK.1.45	But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus
MRK.2.1	And when he returned to Caperna-um after some days, it was reported that he was at home. 
MRK.2.2	And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room for them, not even about the door; and he was preaching the word to them. 
MRK.2.3	 And they came, bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men. 
MRK.2.4	And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him; and when they had made an opening, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic lay. 
MRK.2.5	And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “My son, your sins are forgiven.” 
MRK.2.6	Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts, 
MRK.2.7	“Why does this man speak thus? It is blasphemy! Who can forgive sins but God alone?” 
MRK.2.8	And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, “Why do you question thus in your hearts? 
MRK.2.9	Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise, take up your pallet and walk’? 
MRK.2.10	But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he said to the paralytic— 
MRK.2.11	“I say to you, rise, take up your pallet and go home.” 
MRK.2.12	 And he rose, and immediately took up the pallet and went out before them all; so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything like this!”
MRK.2.13	He went out again beside the sea; and all the crowd gathered about him, and he taught them. 
MRK.2.14	 And as he passed on, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, “Follow me.” And he rose and followed him.
MRK.2.15	And as he sat at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were sitting with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many who followed him. 
MRK.2.16	 And the scribes of
MRK.2.17	And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.”
MRK.2.19	And Jesus said to them, “Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. 
MRK.2.20	 The days will come, when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day. 
MRK.2.21	No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; if he does, the patch tears away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made. 
MRK.2.22	And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost, and so are the skins; but new wine is for fresh skins.”
MRK.2.24	And the Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?” 
MRK.2.25	And he said to them, “Have you never read what David did, when he was in need and was hungry, he and those who were with him: 
MRK.2.26	 how he entered the house of God, when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those who were with him?” 
MRK.2.27	 And he said to them, “The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath; 
MRK.2.28	so the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath.”
MRK.3.2	 And they watched him, to see whether he would heal him on the sabbath, so that they might accuse him. 
MRK.3.3	And he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Come here.” 
MRK.3.4	And he said to them, “Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?” But they were silent. 
MRK.3.5	And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was restored. 
MRK.3.6	 The Pharisees went out, and immediately held counsel with the Herodi-ans against him, how to destroy him.
MRK.3.8	 and Jerusalem and Idumea and from beyond the Jordan and from about Tyre and Sidon a great multitude, hearing all that he did, came to him. 
MRK.3.9	And he told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, lest they should crush him; 
MRK.3.10	 for he had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed upon him to touch him. 
MRK.3.11	And whenever the unclean spirits beheld him, they fell down before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God.” 
MRK.3.12	 And he strictly ordered them not to make him known.
MRK.3.14	 And he appointed twelve,
MRK.3.15	and have authority to cast out demons: 
MRK.3.16	 Simon
MRK.3.17	James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James, whom he surnamed Bo-anerges, that is, sons of thunder; 
MRK.3.18	Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean, 
MRK.3.19	 and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
MRK.3.19	Then he went home; 
MRK.3.20	 and the crowd came together again, so that they could not even eat. 
MRK.3.21	 And when his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for people were saying, “He is beside himself.” 
MRK.3.23	And he called them to him, and said to them in parables, “How can Satan cast out Satan? 
MRK.3.24	If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. 
MRK.3.25	And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. 
MRK.3.26	And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end. 
MRK.3.27	 But no one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man; then indeed he may plunder his house.
MRK.3.29	but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin” — 
MRK.3.30	for they had said, “He has an unclean spirit.”
MRK.3.32	And a crowd was sitting about him; and they said to him, “Your mother and your brothers
MRK.3.33	And he replied, “Who are my mother and my brothers?” 
MRK.3.34	And looking around on those who sat about him, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers! 
MRK.3.35	Whoever does the will of God is my brother, and sister, and mother.”
MRK.4.2	And he taught them many things in parables, and in his teaching he said to them: 
MRK.4.3	“Listen! A sower went out to sow. 
MRK.4.4	And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it. 
MRK.4.5	Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it had not much soil, and immediately it sprang up, since it had no depth of soil; 
MRK.4.6	and when the sun rose it was scorched, and since it had no root it withered away. 
MRK.4.7	Other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain. 
MRK.4.8	And other seeds fell into good soil and brought forth grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.” 
MRK.4.9	And he said, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”
MRK.4.11	 And he said to them, “To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables; 
MRK.4.12	 so that they may indeed see but not perceive, and may indeed hear but not understand; lest they should turn again, and be forgiven.” 
MRK.4.13	 And he said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables? 
MRK.4.14	The sower sows the word. 
MRK.4.15	And these are the ones along the path, where the word is sown; when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word which is sown in them. 
MRK.4.16	And these in like manner are the ones sown upon rocky ground, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy; 
MRK.4.17	and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away.
MRK.4.18	And others are the ones sown among thorns; they are those who hear the word, 
MRK.4.19	but the cares of the world, and the delight in riches, and the desire for other things, enter in and choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. 
MRK.4.20	But those that were sown upon the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.”
MRK.4.22	 For there is nothing hid, except to be made manifest; nor is anything secret, except to come to light. 
MRK.4.23	 If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.” 
MRK.4.24	 And he said to them, “Take heed what you hear; the measure you give will be the measure you get, and still more will be given you. 
MRK.4.25	 For to him who has will more be given; and from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.”
MRK.4.27	and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he knows not how. 
MRK.4.28	The earth produces of itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. 
MRK.4.29	But when the grain is ripe, at once he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.”
MRK.4.31	It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when sown upon the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth; 
MRK.4.32	yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs, and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.”
MRK.4.33	With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it; 
MRK.4.34	 he did not speak to them without a parable, but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.
MRK.4.36	And leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was. And other boats were with him. 
MRK.4.37	And a great storm of wind arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already filling. 
MRK.4.38	But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke him and said to him, “Teacher, do you not care if we perish?” 
MRK.4.39	And he awoke and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace! Be still!” And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. 
MRK.4.40	He said to them, “Why are you afraid? Have you no faith?” 
MRK.4.41	And they were filled with awe, and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even wind and sea obey him?”
MRK.5.2	And when he had come out of the boat, there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, 
MRK.5.3	who lived among the tombs; and no one could bind him any more, even with a chain; 
MRK.5.4	for he had often been bound with fetters and chains, but the chains he wrenched apart, and the fetters he broke in pieces; and no one had the strength to subdue him. 
MRK.5.5	Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out, and bruising himself with stones. 
MRK.5.6	And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshiped him; 
MRK.5.7	 and crying out with a loud voice, he said, “What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, do not torment me.” 
MRK.5.8	For he had said to him, “Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!” 
MRK.5.9	And Jesus
MRK.5.10	And he begged him eagerly not to send them out of the country. 
MRK.5.11	Now a great herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside; 
MRK.5.12	and they begged him, “Send us to the swine, let us enter them.” 
MRK.5.13	So he gave them leave. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered the swine; and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and were drowned in the sea.
MRK.5.14	The herdsmen fled, and told it in the city and in the country. And people came to see what it was that had happened. 
MRK.5.15	And they came to Jesus, and saw the demoniac sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, the man who had the legion; and they were afraid. 
MRK.5.16	And those who had seen it told what had happened to the demoniac and to the swine. 
MRK.5.17	And they began to beg Jesus
MRK.5.18	And as he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons begged him that he might be with him. 
MRK.5.19	But he refused, and said to him, “Go home to your friends, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.” 
MRK.5.20	 And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him; and all men marveled.
MRK.5.22	 Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and seeing him, he fell at his feet, 
MRK.5.23	 and besought him, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well, and live.” 
MRK.5.24	And he went with him.
MRK.5.24	And a great crowd followed him and thronged about him. 
MRK.5.25	And there was a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, 
MRK.5.26	and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better but rather grew worse. 
MRK.5.27	She had heard the reports about Jesus, and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment. 
MRK.5.28	For she said, “If I touch even his garments, I shall be made well.” 
MRK.5.29	And immediately the hemorrhage ceased; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. 
MRK.5.30	 And Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone forth from him, immediately turned about in the crowd, and said, “Who touched my garments?” 
MRK.5.31	And his disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, ‘Who touched me?’ ” 
MRK.5.32	And he looked around to see who had done it. 
MRK.5.33	But the woman, knowing what had been done to her, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him, and told him the whole truth. 
MRK.5.34	 And he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease.”
MRK.5.35	While he was still speaking, there came from the ruler's house some who said, “Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?” 
MRK.5.36	But ignoring
MRK.5.37	 And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter and James and John the brother of James. 
MRK.5.38	When they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, he saw a tumult, and people weeping and wailing loudly. 
MRK.5.39	And when he had entered, he said to them, “Why do you make a tumult and weep? The child is not dead but sleeping.” 
MRK.5.40	And they laughed at him. But he put them all outside, and took the child's father and mother and those who were with him, and went in where the child was. 
MRK.5.41	 Taking her by the hand he said to her, “Talitha cumi”; which means, “Little girl, I say to you, arise.” 
MRK.5.42	And immediately the girl got up and walked (she was twelve years of age), and they were immediately overcome with amazement. 
MRK.5.43	 And he strictly charged them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something to eat.
MRK.6.2	 And on the sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue; and many who heard him were astonished, saying, “Where did this man get all this? What is the wisdom given to him? What mighty works are wrought by his hands! 
MRK.6.3	 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here with us?” And they took offense
MRK.6.4	And Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.” 
MRK.6.5	 And he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands upon a few sick people and healed them. 
MRK.6.6	 And he marveled because of their unbelief.
MRK.6.6	And he went about among the villages teaching.
MRK.6.8	He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staff; no bread, no bag, no money in their belts; 
MRK.6.9	but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics. 
MRK.6.10	And he said to them, “Where you enter a house, stay there until you leave the place. 
MRK.6.11	 And if any place will not receive you and they refuse to hear you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet for a testimony against them.” 
MRK.6.12	 So they went out and preached that men should repent. 
MRK.6.13	 And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them.
MRK.6.15	But others said, “It is Elijah.” And others said, “It is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.” 
MRK.6.16	But when Herod heard of it he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.” 
MRK.6.17	 For Herod had sent and seized John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodi-as, his brother Philip's wife; because he had married her. 
MRK.6.18	For John said to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.” 
MRK.6.19	 And Herodi-as had a grudge against him, and wanted to kill him. But she could not, 
MRK.6.20	 for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he was much perplexed; and yet he heard him gladly. 
MRK.6.21	But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his courtiers and officers and the leading men of Galilee. 
MRK.6.22	For when Herodi-as' daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests; and the king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will grant it.” 
MRK.6.23	 And he vowed to her, “Whatever you ask me, I will give you, even half of my kingdom.” 
MRK.6.24	And she went out, and said to her mother, “What shall I ask?” And she said, “The head of John the baptizer.” 
MRK.6.25	And she came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, saying, “I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.” 
MRK.6.26	And the king was exceedingly sorry; but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her. 
MRK.6.27	And immediately the king sent a soldier of the guard and gave orders to bring his head. He went and beheaded him in the prison, 
MRK.6.28	and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother. 
MRK.6.29	When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body, and laid it in a tomb.
MRK.6.31	And he said to them, “Come away by yourselves to a lonely place, and rest a while.” For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat. 
MRK.6.32	 And they went away in the boat to a lonely place by themselves. 
MRK.6.33	Now many saw them going, and knew them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns, and got there ahead of them. 
MRK.6.34	 As he went ashore he saw a great throng, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and he began to teach them many things. 
MRK.6.35	And when it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, “This is a lonely place, and the hour is now late; 
MRK.6.36	send them away, to go into the country and villages round about and buy themselves something to eat.” 
MRK.6.37	 But he answered them, “You give them something to eat.” And they said to him, “Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii
MRK.6.38	And he said to them, “How many loaves have you? Go and see.” And when they had found out, they said, “Five, and two fish.” 
MRK.6.39	Then he commanded them all to sit down by companies upon the green grass. 
MRK.6.40	So they sat down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties. 
MRK.6.41	 And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples to set before the people; and he divided the two fish among them all. 
MRK.6.42	And they all ate and were satisfied. 
MRK.6.43	And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish. 
MRK.6.44	And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.
MRK.6.46	And after he had taken leave of them, he went up on the mountain to pray. 
MRK.6.47	And when evening came, the boat was out on the sea, and he was alone on the land. 
MRK.6.48	 And he saw that they were making headway painfully, for the wind was against them. And about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. He meant to pass by them, 
MRK.6.49	but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost, and cried out; 
MRK.6.50	 for they all saw him, and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said, “Take heart, it is I; have no fear.” 
MRK.6.51	And he got into the boat with them and the wind ceased. And they were utterly astounded, 
MRK.6.52	 for they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.
MRK.6.54	And when they got out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him, 
MRK.6.55	and ran about the whole neighborhood and began to bring sick people on their pallets to any place where they heard he was. 
MRK.6.56	 And wherever he came, in villages, cities, or country, they laid the sick in the market places, and besought him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched it were made well.
MRK.7.2	they saw that some of his disciples ate with hands defiled, that is, unwashed. 
MRK.7.3	(For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, do not eat unless they wash their hands,
MRK.7.4	 and when they come from the market place, they do not eat unless they purify
MRK.7.5	 And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why do your disciples not live
MRK.7.6	 And he said to them, “Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,
MRK.7.6	‘This people honors me with their lips,
MRK.7.6	but their heart is far from me;
MRK.7.7	in vain do they worship me,
MRK.7.7	teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.’
MRK.7.8	You leave the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of men.”
MRK.7.9	And he said to them, “You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God, in order to keep your tradition! 
MRK.7.10	 For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother’; and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him surely die’; 
MRK.7.11	but you say, ‘If a man tells his father or his mother, What you would have gained from me is Corban’ (that is, given to God)
MRK.7.12	then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother, 
MRK.7.13	thus making void the word of God through your tradition which you hand on. And many such things you do.”
MRK.7.14	And he called the people to him again, and said to them, “Hear me, all of you, and understand: 
MRK.7.15	there is nothing outside a man which by going into him can defile him; but the things which come out of a man are what defile him.” 
MRK.7.17	 And when he had entered the house, and left the people, his disciples asked him about the parable. 
MRK.7.18	 And he said to them, “Then are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into a man from outside cannot defile him, 
MRK.7.19	since it enters, not his heart but his stomach, and so passes on?”
MRK.7.20	 And he said, “What comes out of a man is what defiles a man. 
MRK.7.21	For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, fornication, theft, murder, adultery, 
MRK.7.22	 coveting, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, slander, pride, foolishness. 
MRK.7.23	All these evil things come from within, and they defile a man.”
MRK.7.25	But immediately a woman, whose little daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell down at his feet. 
MRK.7.26	Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter. 
MRK.7.27	And he said to her, “Let the children first be fed, for it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.” 
MRK.7.28	But she answered him, “Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.” 
MRK.7.29	And he said to her, “For this saying you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter.” 
MRK.7.30	And she went home, and found the child lying in bed, and the demon gone.
MRK.7.32	 And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech; and they besought him to lay his hand upon him. 
MRK.7.33	 And taking him aside from the multitude privately, he put his fingers into his ears, and he spat and touched his tongue; 
MRK.7.34	and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, “Ephphatha,” that is, “Be opened.” 
MRK.7.35	And his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly. 
MRK.7.36	 And he charged them to tell no one; but the more he charged them, the more zealously they proclaimed it. 
MRK.7.37	And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well; he even makes the deaf hear and the dumb speak.”
MRK.8.2	“I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me now three days, and have nothing to eat; 
MRK.8.3	and if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way; and some of them have come a long way.” 
MRK.8.4	And his disciples answered him, “How can one feed these men with bread here in the desert?” 
MRK.8.5	And he asked them, “How many loaves have you?” They said, “Seven.” 
MRK.8.6	And he commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground; and he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and they set them before the crowd. 
MRK.8.7	And they had a few small fish; and having blessed them, he commanded that these also should be set before them. 
MRK.8.8	And they ate, and were satisfied; and they took up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full. 
MRK.8.9	And there were about four thousand people. 
MRK.8.10	And he sent them away; and immediately he got into the boat with his disciples, and went to the district of Dalmanutha.
MRK.8.12	And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, “Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign shall be given to this generation.” 
MRK.8.13	 And he left them, and getting into the boat again he departed to the other side.
MRK.8.14	Now they had forgotten to bring bread; and they had only one loaf with them in the boat. 
MRK.8.15	 And he cautioned them, saying, “Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.”
MRK.8.16	And they discussed it with one another, saying, “We have no bread.” 
MRK.8.17	 And being aware of it, Jesus said to them, “Why do you discuss the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened? 
MRK.8.18	Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do you not hear? And do you not remember? 
MRK.8.19	 When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?” They said to him, “Twelve.” 
MRK.8.20	 “And the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?” And they said to him, “Seven.” 
MRK.8.21	And he said to them, “Do you not yet understand?”
MRK.8.23	 And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the village; and when he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands upon him, he asked him, “Do you see anything?” 
MRK.8.24	And he looked up and said, “I see men; but they look like trees, walking.” 
MRK.8.25	Then again he laid his hands upon his eyes; and he looked intently and was restored, and saw everything clearly. 
MRK.8.26	And he sent him away to his home, saying, “Do not even enter the village.”
MRK.8.28	 And they told him, “John the Baptist; and others say, Elijah; and others one of the prophets.” 
MRK.8.29	And he asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered him, “You are the Christ.” 
MRK.8.30	 And he charged them to tell no one about him.
MRK.8.32	And he said this plainly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. 
MRK.8.33	 But turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter, and said, “Get behind me, Satan! For you are not on the side of God, but of men.”
MRK.8.35	 For whoever would save his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it. 
MRK.8.36	For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world and forfeit his life? 
MRK.8.37	For what can a man give in return for his life? 
MRK.8.38	 For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of man also be ashamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”
MRK.9.3	 and his garments became glistening, intensely white, as no fuller on earth could bleach them. 
MRK.9.4	And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses; and they were talking to Jesus. 
MRK.9.5	And Peter said to Jesus, “Master,
MRK.9.6	For he did not know what to say, for they were exceedingly afraid. 
MRK.9.7	 And a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, “This is my beloved Son;
MRK.9.8	And suddenly looking around they no longer saw any one with them but Jesus only.
MRK.9.10	So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what the rising from the dead meant. 
MRK.9.11	 And they asked him, “Why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?” 
MRK.9.12	 And he said to them, “Elijah does come first to restore all things; and how is it written of the Son of man, that he should suffer many things and be treated with contempt? 
MRK.9.13	But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they pleased, as it is written of him.”
MRK.9.15	And immediately all the crowd, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and ran up to him and greeted him. 
MRK.9.16	And he asked them, “What are you discussing with them?” 
MRK.9.17	And one of the crowd answered him, “Teacher, I brought my son to you, for he has a dumb spirit; 
MRK.9.18	and wherever it seizes him, it dashes him down; and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid; and I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able.” 
MRK.9.19	And he answered them, “O faithless generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me.” 
MRK.9.20	And they brought the boy to him; and when the spirit saw him, immediately it convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth. 
MRK.9.21	And Jesus
MRK.9.22	And it has often cast him into the fire and into the water, to destroy him; but if you can do anything, have pity on us and help us.” 
MRK.9.23	 And Jesus said to him, “If you can! All things are possible to him who believes.” 
MRK.9.24	Immediately the father of the child cried out
MRK.9.25	And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, “You dumb and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again.” 
MRK.9.26	And after crying out and convulsing him terribly, it came out, and the boy was like a corpse; so that most of them said, “He is dead.” 
MRK.9.27	But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose. 
MRK.9.28	And when he had entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why could we not cast it out?” 
MRK.9.29	And he said to them, “This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer.”
MRK.9.31	 for he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, “The Son of man will be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he will rise.” 
MRK.9.32	 But they did not understand the saying, and they were afraid to ask him.
MRK.9.34	 But they were silent; for on the way they had discussed with one another who was the greatest. 
MRK.9.35	 And he sat down and called the twelve; and he said to them, “If any one would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.” 
MRK.9.36	 And he took a child, and put him in the midst of them; and taking him in his arms, he said to them, 
MRK.9.37	 “Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not me but him who sent me.”
MRK.9.39	But Jesus said, “Do not forbid him; for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon after to speak evil of me. 
MRK.9.40	For he that is not against us is for us. 
MRK.9.41	 For truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name of Christ, will by no means lose his reward.
MRK.9.43	And if your hand causes you to sin,
MRK.9.45	And if your foot causes you to sin,
MRK.9.47	And if your eye causes you to sin,
MRK.9.48	 where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched. 
MRK.9.49	 For every one will be salted with fire.
MRK.9.50	 Salt is good; but if the salt has lost its saltness, how will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.”
MRK.10.2	And Pharisees came up and in order to test him asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?” 
MRK.10.3	He answered them, “What did Moses command you?” 
MRK.10.4	 They said, “Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce, and to put her away.” 
MRK.10.5	But Jesus said to them, “For your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment. 
MRK.10.6	 But from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’ 
MRK.10.7	 ‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife,
MRK.10.8	and the two shall become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two but one flesh. 
MRK.10.9	What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder.”
MRK.10.10	And in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter. 
MRK.10.11	 And he said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another, commits adultery against her; 
MRK.10.12	and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.”
MRK.10.14	But when Jesus saw it he was indignant, and said to them, “Let the children come to me, do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God. 
MRK.10.15	Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.” 
MRK.10.16	 And he took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands upon them.
MRK.10.18	And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. 
MRK.10.19	 You know the commandments: ‘Do not kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.’ ” 
MRK.10.20	And he said to him, “Teacher, all these I have observed from my youth.” 
MRK.10.21	 And Jesus looking upon him loved him, and said to him, “You lack one thing; go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” 
MRK.10.22	At that saying his countenance fell, and he went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions.
MRK.10.23	And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How hard it will be for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!” 
MRK.10.24	And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, “Children, how hard it is
MRK.10.25	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.” 
MRK.10.26	And they were exceedingly astonished, and said to him,
MRK.10.27	Jesus looked at them and said, “With men it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God.” 
MRK.10.28	 Peter began to say to him, “Lo, we have left everything and followed you.” 
MRK.10.29	Jesus said, “Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel, 
MRK.10.30	 who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life. 
MRK.10.31	 But many that are first will be last, and the last first.”
MRK.10.33	 saying, “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death, and deliver him to the Gentiles; 
MRK.10.34	 and they will mock him, and spit upon him, and scourge him, and kill him; and after three days he will rise.”
MRK.10.36	And he said to them, “What do you want me to do for you?” 
MRK.10.37	 And they said to him, “Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.” 
MRK.10.38	 But Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?” 
MRK.10.39	 And they said to him, “We are able.” And Jesus said to them, “The cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized; 
MRK.10.40	but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.” 
MRK.10.41	And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant at James and John. 
MRK.10.42	 And Jesus called them to him and said to them, “You know that those who are supposed to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them. 
MRK.10.43	 But it shall not be so among you; but whoever would be great among you must be your servant, 
MRK.10.44	and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all. 
MRK.10.45	 For the Son of man also came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”
MRK.10.47	 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” 
MRK.10.48	And many rebuked him, telling him to be silent; but he cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” 
MRK.10.49	And Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.” And they called the blind man, saying to him, “Take heart; rise, he is calling you.” 
MRK.10.50	And throwing off his mantle he sprang up and came to Jesus. 
MRK.10.51	And Jesus said to him, “What do you want me to do for you?” And the blind man said to him, “Master,
MRK.10.52	 And Jesus said to him, “Go your way; your faith has made you well.” And immediately he received his sight and followed him on the way.
MRK.11.2	and said to them, “Go into the village opposite you, and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat; untie it and bring it. 
MRK.11.3	If any one says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.’ ” 
MRK.11.4	 And they went away, and found a colt tied at the door out in the open street; and they untied it. 
MRK.11.5	And those who stood there said to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?” 
MRK.11.6	And they told them what Jesus had said; and they let them go. 
MRK.11.7	 And they brought the colt to Jesus, and threw their garments on it; and he sat upon it. 
MRK.11.8	And many spread their garments on the road, and others spread leafy branches which they had cut from the fields. 
MRK.11.9	 And those who went before and those who followed cried out, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! 
MRK.11.10	Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming! Hosanna in the highest!”
MRK.11.13	And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. 
MRK.11.14	And he said to it, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And his disciples heard it.
MRK.11.16	and he would not allow any one to carry anything through the temple. 
MRK.11.17	 And he taught, and said to them, “Is it not written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations’? But you have made it a den of robbers.” 
MRK.11.18	And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and sought a way to destroy him; for they feared him, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching. 
MRK.11.19	 And when evening came they
MRK.11.21	And Peter remembered and said to him, “Master,
MRK.11.22	And Jesus answered them, “Have faith in God. 
MRK.11.23	Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him. 
MRK.11.24	 Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received
MRK.11.25	 And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against any one; so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.” 
MRK.11.28	and they said to him, “By what authority are you doing these things, or who gave you this authority to do them?” 
MRK.11.29	Jesus said to them, “I will ask you a question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. 
MRK.11.30	Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men? Answer me.” 
MRK.11.31	And they argued with one another, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ 
MRK.11.32	But shall we say, ‘From men’?”—they were afraid of the people, for all held that John was a real prophet. 
MRK.11.33	So they answered Jesus, “We do not know.” And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”
MRK.12.2	When the time came, he sent a servant to the tenants, to get from them some of the fruit of the vineyard. 
MRK.12.3	And they took him and beat him, and sent him away empty-handed. 
MRK.12.4	Again he sent to them another servant, and they wounded him in the head, and treated him shamefully. 
MRK.12.5	And he sent another, and him they killed; and so with many others, some they beat and some they killed. 
MRK.12.6	He had still one other, a beloved son; finally he sent him to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ 
MRK.12.7	But those tenants said to one another, ‘This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ 
MRK.12.8	And they took him and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard. 
MRK.12.9	What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants, and give the vineyard to others. 
MRK.12.10	 Have you not read this scripture:
MRK.12.10	‘The very stone which the builders rejected
MRK.12.10	has become the head of the corner;
MRK.12.11	this was the Lord's doing,
MRK.12.11	and it is marvelous in our eyes’?”
MRK.12.14	And they came and said to him, “Teacher, we know that you are true, and care for no man; for you do not regard the position of men, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? 
MRK.12.15	Should we pay them, or should we not?” But knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, “Why put me to the test? Bring me a coin,
MRK.12.16	And they brought one. And he said to them, “Whose likeness and inscription is this?” They said to him, “Caesar's.” 
MRK.12.17	 Jesus said to them, “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.” And they were amazed at him.
MRK.12.19	 “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife, but leaves no child, the man
MRK.12.20	There were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and when he died left no children; 
MRK.12.21	and the second took her, and died, leaving no children; and the third likewise; 
MRK.12.22	and the seven left no children. Last of all the woman also died. 
MRK.12.23	In the resurrection whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife.”
MRK.12.24	Jesus said to them, “Is not this why you are wrong, that you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God? 
MRK.12.25	For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. 
MRK.12.26	 And as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God said to him, ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? 
MRK.12.27	He is not God of the dead, but of the living; you are quite wrong.”
MRK.12.29	 Jesus answered, “The first is, ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one; 
MRK.12.30	and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ 
MRK.12.31	 The second is this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.” 
MRK.12.32	And the scribe said to him, “You are right, Teacher; you have truly said that he is one, and there is no other but he; 
MRK.12.33	 and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.” 
MRK.12.34	And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” And after that no one dared to ask him any question.
MRK.12.36	 David himself, inspired by
MRK.12.36	‘The Lord said to my Lord,
MRK.12.36	Sit at my right hand,
MRK.12.36	till I put thy enemies under thy feet.’
MRK.12.37	David himself calls him Lord; so how is he his son?” And the great throng heard him gladly.
MRK.12.39	and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts, 
MRK.12.40	who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.”
MRK.12.42	And a poor widow came, and put in two copper coins, which make a penny. 
MRK.12.43	And he called his disciples to him, and said to them, “Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury. 
MRK.12.44	For they all contributed out of their abundance; but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had, her whole living.”
MRK.13.2	 And Jesus said to him, “Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon another, that will not be thrown down.”
MRK.13.4	 “Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign when these things are all to be accomplished?” 
MRK.13.5	And Jesus began to say to them, “Take heed that no one leads you astray. 
MRK.13.6	 Many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he!’ and they will lead many astray. 
MRK.13.7	And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; this must take place, but the end is not yet. 
MRK.13.8	For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places, there will be famines; this is but the beginning of the birth-pangs.
MRK.13.10	And the gospel must first be preached to all nations. 
MRK.13.11	 And when they bring you to trial and deliver you up, do not be anxious beforehand what you are to say; but say whatever is given you in that hour, for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit. 
MRK.13.12	And brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death; 
MRK.13.13	 and you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved.
MRK.13.15	let him who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter his house, to take anything away; 
MRK.13.16	and let him who is in the field not turn back to take his mantle. 
MRK.13.17	 And alas for those who are with child and for those who give suck in those days! 
MRK.13.18	Pray that it may not happen in winter. 
MRK.13.19	For in those days there will be such tribulation as has not been from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will be. 
MRK.13.20	And if the Lord had not shortened the days, no human being would be saved; but for the sake of the elect, whom he chose, he shortened the days. 
MRK.13.21	And then if any one says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘Look, there he is!’ do not believe it. 
MRK.13.22	 False Christs and false prophets will arise and show signs and wonders, to lead astray, if possible, the elect. 
MRK.13.23	But take heed; I have told you all things beforehand.
MRK.13.24	“But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, 
MRK.13.25	and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken. 
MRK.13.26	 And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory. 
MRK.13.27	And then he will send out the angels, and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.
MRK.13.28	“From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near. 
MRK.13.29	So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that he is near, at the very gates. 
MRK.13.30	 Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away before all these things take place. 
MRK.13.31	 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
MRK.13.33	 Take heed, watch;
MRK.13.34	 It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his servants in charge, each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to be on the watch. 
MRK.13.35	 Watch therefore—for you do not know when the master of the house will come, in the evening, or at midnight, or at cockcrow, or in the morning— 
MRK.13.36	lest he come suddenly and find you asleep. 
MRK.13.37	And what I say to you I say to all: Watch.”
MRK.14.2	for they said, “Not during the feast, lest there be a tumult of the people.”
MRK.14.4	But there were some who said to themselves indignantly, “Why was the ointment thus wasted? 
MRK.14.5	For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii,
MRK.14.6	But Jesus said, “Let her alone; why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me. 
MRK.14.7	 For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you will, you can do good to them; but you will not always have me. 
MRK.14.8	 She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burying. 
MRK.14.9	And truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her.”
MRK.14.11	And when they heard it they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought an opportunity to betray him.
MRK.14.13	And he sent two of his disciples, and said to them, “Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him, 
MRK.14.14	and wherever he enters, say to the householder, ‘The Teacher says, Where is my guest room, where I am to eat the passover with my disciples?’ 
MRK.14.15	And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; there prepare for us.” 
MRK.14.16	And the disciples set out and went to the city, and found it as he had told them; and they prepared the passover.
MRK.14.18	And as they were at table eating, Jesus said, “Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.” 
MRK.14.19	They began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one after another, “Is it I?” 
MRK.14.20	He said to them, “It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread into the dish with me. 
MRK.14.21	For the Son of man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.”
MRK.14.23	 And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. 
MRK.14.24	 And he said to them, “This is my blood of the
MRK.14.25	Truly, I say to you, I shall not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”
MRK.14.27	 And Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away; for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’ 
MRK.14.28	 But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.” 
MRK.14.29	Peter said to him, “Even though they all fall away, I will not.” 
MRK.14.30	 And Jesus said to him, “Truly, I say to you, this very night, before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times.” 
MRK.14.31	But he said vehemently, “If I must die with you, I will not deny you.” And they all said the same.
MRK.14.33	And he took with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly distressed and troubled. 
MRK.14.34	 And he said to them, “My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch.”
MRK.14.35	And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. 
MRK.14.36	 And he said, “Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee; remove this cup from me; yet not what I will, but what thou wilt.” 
MRK.14.37	And he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, “Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch
MRK.14.38	 Watch
MRK.14.39	And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words. 
MRK.14.40	And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know what to answer him. 
MRK.14.41	And he came the third time, and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is enough; the hour has come; the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 
MRK.14.42	Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.”
MRK.14.44	Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “The one I shall kiss is the man; seize him and lead him away under guard.” 
MRK.14.45	And when he came, he went up to him at once, and said, “Master!”
MRK.14.46	And they laid hands on him and seized him. 
MRK.14.47	But one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear. 
MRK.14.48	And Jesus said to them, “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? 
MRK.14.49	 Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But let the scriptures be fulfilled.” 
MRK.14.50	And they all forsook him, and fled.
MRK.14.51	And a young man followed him, with nothing but a linen cloth about his body; and they seized him, 
MRK.14.52	but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked.
MRK.14.54	And Peter had followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the guards, and warming himself at the fire. 
MRK.14.55	Now the chief priests and the whole council sought testimony against Jesus to put him to death; but they found none. 
MRK.14.56	For many bore false witness against him, and their witness did not agree. 
MRK.14.57	And some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying, 
MRK.14.58	 “We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, not made with hands.’ ” 
MRK.14.59	Yet not even so did their testimony agree. 
MRK.14.60	And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?” 
MRK.14.61	But he was silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?” 
MRK.14.62	 And Jesus said, “I am; and you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.” 
MRK.14.63	 And the high priest tore his garments, and said, “Why do we still need witnesses? 
MRK.14.64	 You have heard his blasphemy. What is your decision?” And they all condemned him as deserving death. 
MRK.14.65	And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to strike him, saying to him, “Prophesy!” And the guards received him with blows.
MRK.14.67	and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, “You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.” 
MRK.14.68	But he denied it, saying, “I neither know nor understand what you mean.” And he went out into the gateway.
MRK.14.69	And the maid saw him, and began again to say to the bystanders, “This man is one of them.” 
MRK.14.70	But again he denied it. And after a little while again the bystanders said to Peter, “Certainly you are one of them; for you are a Galilean.” 
MRK.14.71	But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, “I do not know this man of whom you speak.” 
MRK.14.72	And immediately the cock crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him, “Before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times.” And he broke down and wept.
MRK.15.2	 And Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” And he answered him, “You have said so.” 
MRK.15.3	And the chief priests accused him of many things. 
MRK.15.4	And Pilate again asked him, “Have you no answer to make? See how many charges they bring against you.” 
MRK.15.5	But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate wondered.
MRK.15.6	Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they asked. 
MRK.15.7	And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabbas. 
MRK.15.8	And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he was wont to do for them. 
MRK.15.9	And he answered them, “Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?” 
MRK.15.10	For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up. 
MRK.15.11	 But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead. 
MRK.15.12	And Pilate again said to them, “Then what shall I do with the man whom you call the King of the Jews?” 
MRK.15.13	And they cried out again, “Crucify him.” 
MRK.15.14	And Pilate said to them, “Why, what evil has he done?” But they shouted all the more, “Crucify him.” 
MRK.15.15	So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barabbas; and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.
MRK.15.17	And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and plaiting a crown of thorns they put it on him. 
MRK.15.18	And they began to salute him, “Hail, King of the Jews!” 
MRK.15.19	And they struck his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and they knelt down in homage to him. 
MRK.15.20	And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak, and put his own clothes on him. And they led him out to crucify him.
MRK.15.22	 And they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means the place of a skull). 
MRK.15.23	And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh; but he did not take it. 
MRK.15.24	 And they crucified him, and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take. 
MRK.15.25	And it was the third hour, when they crucified him. 
MRK.15.26	And the inscription of the charge against him read, “The King of the Jews.” 
MRK.15.27	And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left. 
MRK.15.29	 And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads, and saying, “Aha! You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, 
MRK.15.30	save yourself, and come down from the cross!” 
MRK.15.31	 So also the chief priests mocked him to one another with the scribes, saying, “He saved others; he cannot save himself. 
MRK.15.32	Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.” Those who were crucified with him also reviled him.
MRK.15.34	 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, “Elo-i, Elo-i, lama sabach-thani?” which means, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” 
MRK.15.35	And some of the bystanders hearing it said, “Behold, he is calling Elijah.” 
MRK.15.36	 And one ran and, filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.” 
MRK.15.37	And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed his last. 
MRK.15.38	 And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. 
MRK.15.39	 And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that he thus
MRK.15.41	 who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered to him; and also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.
MRK.15.43	Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, took courage and went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. 
MRK.15.44	And Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead.
MRK.15.45	And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the body to Joseph. 
MRK.15.46	And he bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. 
MRK.15.47	Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.
MRK.16.2	And very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb when the sun had risen. 
MRK.16.3	And they were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb?” 
MRK.16.4	And looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back—it was very large. 
MRK.16.5	And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe; and they were amazed. 
MRK.16.6	And he said to them, “Do not be amazed; you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen, he is not here; see the place where they laid him. 
MRK.16.7	 But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you.” 
MRK.16.8	And they went out and fled from the tomb; for trembling and astonishment had come upon them; and they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid.
MRK.16.9	Now when he rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. 
MRK.16.10	She went out and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept. 
MRK.16.11	But when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they would not believe it.
MRK.16.12	After this he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country. 
MRK.16.13	And they went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them.
MRK.16.14	Afterward he appeared to the eleven themselves as they sat at table; and he upbraided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen. 
MRK.16.15	And he said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation. 
MRK.16.16	He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned. 
MRK.16.17	And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; 
MRK.16.18	they will pick up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.”
MRK.16.19	So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God. 
MRK.16.20	And they went forth and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that attended it. Amen.
LUK.1.1	Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things which have been accomplished among us, 
LUK.1.2	 just as they were delivered to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word, 
LUK.1.3	 it seemed good to me also, having followed all things closely
LUK.1.4	 that you may know the truth concerning the things of which you have been informed.
LUK.1.6	And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. 
LUK.1.7	But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in years.
LUK.1.8	Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty, 
LUK.1.9	 according to the custom of the priesthood, it fell to him by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. 
LUK.1.10	And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense. 
LUK.1.11	 And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. 
LUK.1.12	And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. 
LUK.1.13	 But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer is heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.
LUK.1.14	And you will have joy and gladness,
LUK.1.14	and many will rejoice at his birth;
LUK.1.15	and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink,
LUK.1.15	and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit,
LUK.1.15	even from his mother's womb.
LUK.1.16	And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God,
LUK.1.17	to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,
LUK.1.17	and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just,
LUK.1.17	to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.”
LUK.1.19	 And the angel answered him, “I am Gabriel, who stand in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news. 
LUK.1.20	And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things come to pass, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.” 
LUK.1.21	And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they wondered at his delay in the temple. 
LUK.1.22	And when he came out, he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he made signs to them and remained dumb. 
LUK.1.23	And when his time of service was ended, he went to his home.
LUK.1.24	After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she hid herself, saying, 
LUK.1.25	 “Thus the Lord has done to me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.”
LUK.1.26	In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, 
LUK.1.27	to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. 
LUK.1.28	And he came to her and said, “Hail, O favored one, the Lord is with you!”
LUK.1.29	But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered in her mind what sort of greeting this might be. 
LUK.1.30	 And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. 
LUK.1.31	 And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus.
LUK.1.32	He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High;
LUK.1.32	and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David,
LUK.1.33	and of his kingdom there will be no end.”
LUK.1.35	 And the angel said to her,
LUK.1.35	“The Holy Spirit will come upon you,
LUK.1.35	and the power of the Most High will overshadow you;
LUK.1.35	therefore the child to be born
LUK.1.35	the Son of God.
LUK.1.36	And behold, your kinswoman Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. 
LUK.1.37	 For with God nothing will be impossible.” 
LUK.1.38	And Mary said, “Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her.
LUK.1.39	In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a city of Judah, 
LUK.1.40	and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. 
LUK.1.41	And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit 
LUK.1.42	 and she exclaimed with a loud cry, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! 
LUK.1.43	And why is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 
LUK.1.44	For behold, when the voice of your greeting came to my ears, the babe in my womb leaped for joy. 
LUK.1.45	And blessed is she who believed that there would be
LUK.1.46	 And Mary said,
LUK.1.46	“My soul magnifies the Lord,
LUK.1.48	for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden.
LUK.1.48	For behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed;
LUK.1.49	for he who is mighty has done great things for me,
LUK.1.49	and holy is his name.
LUK.1.50	And his mercy is on those who fear him
LUK.1.50	from generation to generation.
LUK.1.51	He has shown strength with his arm,
LUK.1.51	he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts,
LUK.1.52	he has put down the mighty from their thrones,
LUK.1.52	and exalted those of low degree;
LUK.1.53	he has filled the hungry with good things,
LUK.1.53	and the rich he has sent empty away.
LUK.1.54	He has helped his servant Israel,
LUK.1.54	in remembrance of his mercy,
LUK.1.55	to Abraham and to his posterity for ever.”
LUK.1.56	And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her home.
LUK.1.57	Now the time came for Elizabeth to be delivered, and she gave birth to a son. 
LUK.1.58	And her neighbors and kinsfolk heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her. 
LUK.1.59	 And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they would have named him Zechariah after his father, 
LUK.1.60	but his mother said, “Not so; he shall be called John.” 
LUK.1.61	And they said to her, “None of your kindred is called by this name.” 
LUK.1.62	And they made signs to his father, inquiring what he would have him called. 
LUK.1.63	 And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, “His name is John.” And they all marveled. 
LUK.1.64	And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God. 
LUK.1.65	And fear came on all their neighbors. And all these things were talked about through all the hill country of Judea; 
LUK.1.66	and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, “What then will this child be?” For the hand of the Lord was with him.
LUK.1.67	And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,
LUK.1.68	“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,
LUK.1.68	for he has visited and redeemed his people,
LUK.1.69	and has raised up a horn of salvation for us
LUK.1.69	in the house of his servant David,
LUK.1.70	as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,
LUK.1.71	that we should be saved from our enemies,
LUK.1.71	and from the hand of all who hate us;
LUK.1.72	to perform the mercy promised to our fathers,
LUK.1.72	and to remember his holy covenant,
LUK.1.73	the oath which he swore to our father Abraham,
LUK.1.74	to grant us
LUK.1.74	that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies,
LUK.1.74	might serve him without fear,
LUK.1.75	in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life.
LUK.1.76	for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,
LUK.1.77	in the forgiveness of their sins,
LUK.1.78	when the day shall dawn upon
LUK.1.79	to guide our feet into the way of peace.”
LUK.2.2	This was the first enrollment, when Quirini-us was governor of Syria. 
LUK.2.3	And all went to be enrolled, each to his own city. 
LUK.2.4	 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, 
LUK.2.5	to be enrolled with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. 
LUK.2.6	And while they were there, the time came for her to be delivered. 
LUK.2.7	And she gave birth to her first-born son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.
LUK.2.8	And in that region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. 
LUK.2.9	 And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with fear. 
LUK.2.10	And the angel said to them, “Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of a great joy which will come to all the people; 
LUK.2.11	 for to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. 
LUK.2.12	 And this will be a sign for you: you will find a babe wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.” 
LUK.2.13	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,
LUK.2.14	and on earth peace among men with whom he is pleased!”
LUK.2.15	When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” 
LUK.2.16	And they went with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. 
LUK.2.17	And when they saw it they made known the saying which had been told them concerning this child; 
LUK.2.18	and all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. 
LUK.2.19	 But Mary kept all these things, pondering them in her heart. 
LUK.2.20	And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.
LUK.2.23	 (as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord”) 
LUK.2.24	and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord, “a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.” 
LUK.2.25	 Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. 
LUK.2.26	And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ. 
LUK.2.27	And inspired by the Spirit
LUK.2.28	he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,
LUK.2.29	“Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace,
LUK.2.29	according to thy word;
LUK.2.31	which thou hast prepared in the presence of all peoples,
LUK.2.32	and for glory to thy people Israel.”
LUK.2.33	And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him; 
LUK.2.34	and Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother,
LUK.2.34	“Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising of many in Israel,
LUK.2.34	and for a sign that is spoken against
LUK.2.35	(and a sword will pierce through your own soul also),
LUK.2.35	that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed.”
LUK.2.37	and as a widow till she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day. 
LUK.2.38	And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks to God, and spoke of him to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.
LUK.2.39	And when they had performed everything according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth. 
LUK.2.40	 And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom; and the favor of God was upon him.
LUK.2.42	And when he was twelve years old, they went up according to custom; 
LUK.2.43	and when the feast was ended, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it, 
LUK.2.44	but supposing him to be in the company they went a day's journey, and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintances; 
LUK.2.45	and when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him. 
LUK.2.46	After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions; 
LUK.2.47	and all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. 
LUK.2.48	 And when they saw him they were astonished; and his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and I have been looking for you anxiously.” 
LUK.2.49	And he said to them, “How is it that you sought me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?” 
LUK.2.50	And they did not understand the saying which he spoke to them. 
LUK.2.51	 And he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them; and his mother kept all these things in her heart.
LUK.3.2	 in the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness; 
LUK.3.3	 and he went into all the region about the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. 
LUK.3.4	 As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet,
LUK.3.4	“The voice of one crying in the wilderness:
LUK.3.4	Prepare the way of the Lord,
LUK.3.4	make his paths straight.
LUK.3.5	Every valley shall be filled,
LUK.3.5	and every mountain and hill shall be brought low,
LUK.3.5	and the crooked shall be made straight,
LUK.3.5	and the rough ways shall be made smooth;
LUK.3.8	 Bear fruits that befit repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father’; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham. 
LUK.3.9	 Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.”
LUK.3.10	And the multitudes asked him, “What then shall we do?” 
LUK.3.11	 And he answered them, “He who has two coats, let him share with him who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise.” 
LUK.3.12	Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and said to him, “Teacher, what shall we do?” 
LUK.3.13	And he said to them, “Collect no more than is appointed you.” 
LUK.3.14	Soldiers also asked him, “And we, what shall we do?” And he said to them, “Rob no one by violence or by false accusation, and be content with your wages.”
LUK.3.16	 John answered them all, “I baptize you with water; but he who is mightier than I is coming, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. 
LUK.3.17	His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor, and to gather the wheat into his granary, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.”
LUK.3.18	So, with many other exhortations, he preached good news to the people. 
LUK.3.19	 But Herod the tetrarch, who had been reproved by him for Herodi-as, his brother's wife, and for all the evil things that Herod had done, 
LUK.3.20	added this to them all, that he shut up John in prison.
LUK.3.22	 and the Holy Spirit descended upon him in bodily form, as a dove, and a voice came from heaven, “Thou art my beloved Son;
LUK.3.24	the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Janna-i, the son of Joseph, 
LUK.3.25	the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Nagga-i, 
LUK.3.26	the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Seme-in, the son of Josech, the son of Joda, 
LUK.3.27	the son of Jo-anan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of She-alti-el,
LUK.3.28	the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er, 
LUK.3.29	the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, 
LUK.3.30	the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim, 
LUK.3.31	the son of Mele-a, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David, 
LUK.3.32	the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Sala, the son of Nahshon, 
LUK.3.33	the son of Amminadab, the son of Admin, the son of Arni, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah, 
LUK.3.34	the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor, 
LUK.3.35	the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah, 
LUK.3.36	the son of Ca-inan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, 
LUK.3.37	the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalale-el, the son of Ca-inan, 
LUK.3.38	the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.
LUK.4.2	 for forty days in the wilderness, tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing in those days; and when they were ended, he was hungry. 
LUK.4.3	The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.” 
LUK.4.4	 And Jesus answered him, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone.’ ” 
LUK.4.5	And the devil took him up, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, 
LUK.4.6	 and said to him, “To you I will give all this authority and their glory; for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will. 
LUK.4.7	If you, then, will worship me, it shall all be yours.” 
LUK.4.8	 And Jesus answered him, “It is written,
LUK.4.8	‘You shall worship the Lord your God,
LUK.4.8	and him only shall you serve.’ ”
LUK.4.9	And he took him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here; 
LUK.4.10	 for it is written,
LUK.4.10	‘He will give his angels charge of you, to guard you,’
LUK.4.11	and
LUK.4.11	‘On their hands they will bear you up,
LUK.4.11	lest you strike your foot against a stone.’ ”
LUK.4.13	 And when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time.
LUK.4.15	 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.
LUK.4.17	and there was given to him the book of the prophet Isaiah. He opened the book and found the place where it was written,
LUK.4.18	because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor.
LUK.4.18	He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives
LUK.4.18	and recovering of sight to the blind,
LUK.4.18	to set at liberty those who are oppressed,
LUK.4.19	to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.”
LUK.4.20	And he closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. 
LUK.4.21	And he began to say to them, “Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.” 
LUK.4.22	 And all spoke well of him, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth; and they said, “Is not this Joseph's son?” 
LUK.4.23	 And he said to them, “Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb, ‘Physician, heal yourself; what we have heard you did at Caperna-um, do here also in your own country.’ ” 
LUK.4.24	 And he said, “Truly, I say to you, no prophet is acceptable in his own country. 
LUK.4.25	 But in truth, I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when there came a great famine over all the land; 
LUK.4.26	and Elijah was sent to none of them but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. 
LUK.4.27	 And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha; and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.” 
LUK.4.28	When they heard this, all in the synagogue were filled with wrath. 
LUK.4.29	 And they rose up and put him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong. 
LUK.4.30	 But passing through the midst of them he went away.
LUK.4.32	 and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority. 
LUK.4.33	And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice, 
LUK.4.34	“Ah!
LUK.4.35	But Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!” And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst, he came out of him, having done him no harm. 
LUK.4.36	And they were all amazed and said to one another, “What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.” 
LUK.4.37	 And reports of him went out into every place in the surrounding region.
LUK.4.39	And he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her; and immediately she rose and served them.
LUK.4.40	Now when the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them. 
LUK.4.41	And demons also came out of many, crying, “You are the Son of God!” But he rebuked them, and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.
LUK.4.43	but he said to them, “I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also; for I was sent for this purpose.” 
LUK.4.44	 And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea.
LUK.5.2	And he saw two boats by the lake; but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets. 
LUK.5.3	 Getting into one of the boats, which was Simon's, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the people from the boat. 
LUK.5.4	And when he had ceased speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.” 
LUK.5.5	 And Simon answered, “Master, we toiled all night and took nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets.” 
LUK.5.6	And when they had done this, they enclosed a great shoal of fish; and as their nets were breaking, 
LUK.5.7	they beckoned to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. 
LUK.5.8	But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.” 
LUK.5.9	For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the catch of fish which they had taken; 
LUK.5.10	and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid; henceforth you will be catching men.” 
LUK.5.11	And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.
LUK.5.13	And he stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, “I will; be clean.” And immediately the leprosy left him. 
LUK.5.14	 And he charged him to tell no one; but “go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, for a proof to the people.”
LUK.5.15	 But so much the more the report went abroad concerning him; and great multitudes gathered to hear and to be healed of their infirmities. 
LUK.5.16	 But he withdrew to the wilderness and prayed.
LUK.5.18	And behold, men were bringing on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they sought to bring him in and lay him before Jesus;
LUK.5.19	but finding no way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus. 
LUK.5.20	 And when he saw their faith he said, “Man, your sins are forgiven you.” 
LUK.5.21	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to question, saying, “Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God only?” 
LUK.5.22	When Jesus perceived their questionings, he answered them, “Why do you question in your hearts? 
LUK.5.23	Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Rise and walk’? 
LUK.5.24	But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he said to the man who was paralyzed—“I say to you, rise, take up your bed and go home.” 
LUK.5.25	And immediately he rose before them, and took up that on which he lay, and went home, glorifying God. 
LUK.5.26	And amazement seized them all, and they glorified God and were filled with awe, saying, “We have seen strange things today.”
LUK.5.28	And he left everything, and rose and followed him.
LUK.5.29	And Levi made him a great feast in his house; and there was a large company of tax collectors and others sitting at table
LUK.5.30	 And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?” 
LUK.5.31	And Jesus answered them, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick; 
LUK.5.32	 I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”
LUK.5.34	And Jesus said to them, “Can you make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? 
LUK.5.35	 The days will come, when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days.” 
LUK.5.36	He told them a parable also: “No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it upon an old garment; if he does, he will tear the new, and the piece from the new will not match the old. 
LUK.5.37	And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed. 
LUK.5.38	But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins. 
LUK.5.39	And no one after drinking old wine desires new; for he says, ‘The old is good.’ ”
LUK.6.2	 But some of the Pharisees said, “Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the sabbath?” 
LUK.6.3	 And Jesus answered, “Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him: 
LUK.6.4	 how he entered the house of God, and took and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those with him?” 
LUK.6.5	And he said to them, “The Son of man is lord of the sabbath.”
LUK.6.7	And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the sabbath, so that they might find an accusation against him. 
LUK.6.8	But he knew their thoughts, and he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Come and stand here.” And he rose and stood there. 
LUK.6.9	And Jesus said to them, “I ask you, is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to destroy it?” 
LUK.6.10	And he looked around on them all, and said to him, “Stretch out your hand.” And he did so, and his hand was restored. 
LUK.6.11	But they were filled with fury and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.
LUK.6.13	And when it was day, he called his disciples, and chose from them twelve, whom he named apostles; 
LUK.6.14	Simon, whom he named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip, and Bartholomew, 
LUK.6.15	and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot, 
LUK.6.16	and Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.
LUK.6.18	and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured. 
LUK.6.19	 And all the crowd sought to touch him, for power came forth from him and healed them all.
LUK.6.20	“Blessed are you poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
LUK.6.21	“Blessed are you that hunger now, for you shall be satisfied.
LUK.6.21	“Blessed are you that weep now, for you shall laugh.
LUK.6.23	Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for so their fathers did to the prophets.
LUK.6.25	“Woe to you that are full now, for you shall hunger.
LUK.6.25	“Woe to you that laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep.
LUK.6.26	“Woe to you, when all men speak well of you, for so their fathers did to the false prophets.
LUK.6.28	bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you. 
LUK.6.29	To him who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from him who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt. 
LUK.6.30	Give to every one who begs from you; and of him who takes away your goods do not ask them again. 
LUK.6.31	 And as you wish that men would do to you, do so to them.
LUK.6.33	And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. 
LUK.6.34	And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive as much again. 
LUK.6.35	 But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return;
LUK.6.36	Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful.
LUK.6.38	 give, and it will be given to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap. For the measure you give will be the measure you get back.”
LUK.6.40	 A disciple is not above his teacher, but every one when he is fully taught will be like his teacher. 
LUK.6.41	 Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? 
LUK.6.42	Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take out the speck that is in your eye,’ when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother's eye.
LUK.6.44	for each tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thorns, nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush. 
LUK.6.45	 The good man out of the good treasure of his heart produces good, and the evil man out of his evil treasure produces evil; for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.
LUK.6.47	 Every one who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you what he is like: 
LUK.6.48	he is like a man building a house, who dug deep, and laid the foundation upon rock; and when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it, because it had been well built.
LUK.6.49	But he who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation; against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.”
LUK.7.2	Now a centurion had a slave who was dear
LUK.7.3	When he heard of Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and heal his slave. 
LUK.7.4	And when they came to Jesus, they besought him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy to have you do this for him, 
LUK.7.5	 for he loves our nation, and he built us our synagogue.” 
LUK.7.6	And Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, “Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; 
LUK.7.7	therefore I did not presume to come to you. But say the word, and let my servant be healed. 
LUK.7.8	For I am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me: and I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my slave, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” 
LUK.7.9	When Jesus heard this he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude that followed him, “I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.” 
LUK.7.10	And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave well.
LUK.7.12	As he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, a man who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a large crowd from the city was with her. 
LUK.7.13	 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her and said to her, “Do not weep.” 
LUK.7.14	And he came and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still. And he said, “Young man, I say to you, arise.” 
LUK.7.15	And the dead man sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother. 
LUK.7.16	 Fear seized them all; and they glorified God, saying, “A great prophet has arisen among us!” and “God has visited his people!” 
LUK.7.17	And this report concerning him spread through the whole of Judea and all the surrounding country.
LUK.7.19	And John, calling to him two of his disciples, sent them to the Lord, saying, “Are you he who is to come, or shall we look for another?” 
LUK.7.20	And when the men had come to him, they said, “John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you he who is to come, or shall we look for another?’ ” 
LUK.7.21	 In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and on many that were blind he bestowed sight. 
LUK.7.22	 And he answered them, “Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good news preached to them. 
LUK.7.23	And blessed is he who takes no offense at me.”
LUK.7.24	When the messengers of John had gone, he began to speak to the crowds concerning John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to behold? A reed shaken by the wind? 
LUK.7.25	What then did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously appareled and live in luxury are in kings' courts. 
LUK.7.26	What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. 
LUK.7.27	 This is he of whom it is written,
LUK.7.27	‘Behold, I send my messenger before thy face,
LUK.7.27	who shall prepare thy way before thee.’
LUK.7.28	I tell you, among those born of women none is greater than John; yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.” 
LUK.7.29	 (When they heard this all the people and the tax collectors justified God, having been baptized with the baptism of John; 
LUK.7.30	but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him.)
LUK.7.31	“To what then shall I compare the men of this generation, and what are they like? 
LUK.7.32	They are like children sitting in the market place and calling to one another,
LUK.7.32	‘We piped to you, and you did not dance;
LUK.7.32	we wailed, and you did not weep.’
LUK.7.34	 The Son of man has come eating and drinking; and you say, ‘Behold, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ 
LUK.7.35	Yet wisdom is justified by all her children.”
LUK.7.37	And behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that he was at table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of ointment, 
LUK.7.38	and standing behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. 
LUK.7.39	 Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner.” 
LUK.7.40	And Jesus answering said to him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” And he answered, “What is it, Teacher?” 
LUK.7.41	“A certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. 
LUK.7.42	 When they could not pay, he forgave them both. Now which of them will love him more?” 
LUK.7.43	 Simon answered, “The one, I suppose, to whom he forgave more.” And he said to him, “You have judged rightly.” 
LUK.7.44	Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered your house, you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. 
LUK.7.45	You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not ceased to kiss my feet. 
LUK.7.46	You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. 
LUK.7.47	Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much; but he who is forgiven little, loves little.” 
LUK.7.48	 And he said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” 
LUK.7.49	Then those who were at table with him began to say among themselves, “Who is this, who even forgives sins?” 
LUK.7.50	 And he said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”
LUK.8.2	and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, 
LUK.8.3	and Jo-anna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them
LUK.8.5	“A sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell along the path, and was trodden under foot, and the birds of the air devoured it. 
LUK.8.6	And some fell on the rock; and as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture. 
LUK.8.7	And some fell among thorns; and the thorns grew with it and choked it. 
LUK.8.8	 And some fell into good soil and grew, and yielded a hundredfold.” As he said this, he called out, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”
LUK.8.10	he said, “To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but for others they are in parables, so that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand. 
LUK.8.12	The ones along the path are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, that they may not believe and be saved. 
LUK.8.13	And the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy; but these have no root, they believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away. 
LUK.8.14	And as for what fell among the thorns, they are those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature. 
LUK.8.15	And as for that in the good soil, they are those who, hearing the word, hold it fast in an honest and good heart, and bring forth fruit with patience.
LUK.8.17	 For nothing is hid that shall not be made manifest, nor anything secret that shall not be known and come to light. 
LUK.8.18	 Take heed then how you hear; for to him who has will more be given, and from him who has not, even what he thinks that he has will be taken away.”
LUK.8.20	And he was told, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you.” 
LUK.8.21	 But he said to them, “My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.”
LUK.8.23	and as they sailed he fell asleep. And a storm of wind came down on the lake, and they were filling with water, and were in danger. 
LUK.8.24	 And they went and woke him, saying, “Master, Master, we are perishing!” And he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging waves; and they ceased, and there was a calm. 
LUK.8.25	He said to them, “Where is your faith?” And they were afraid, and they marveled, saying to one another, “Who then is this, that he commands even wind and water, and they obey him?”
LUK.8.27	And as he stepped out on land, there met him a man from the city who had demons; for a long time he had worn no clothes, and he lived not in a house but among the tombs. 
LUK.8.28	 When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, “What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beseech you, do not torment me.” 
LUK.8.29	For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For many a time it had seized him; he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters, but he broke the bonds and was driven by the demon into the desert.) 
LUK.8.30	Jesus then asked him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Legion”; for many demons had entered him. 
LUK.8.31	And they begged him not to command them to depart into the abyss. 
LUK.8.32	Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside; and they begged him to let them enter these. So he gave them leave. 
LUK.8.33	Then the demons came out of the man and entered the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.
LUK.8.34	When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country. 
LUK.8.35	Then people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. 
LUK.8.36	And those who had seen it told them how he who had been possessed with demons was healed. 
LUK.8.37	Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes
LUK.8.38	The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him; but he sent him away, saying, 
LUK.8.39	“Return to your home, and declare how much God has done for you.” And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.
LUK.8.41	And there came a man named Jairus, who was a ruler of the synagogue; and falling at Jesus' feet he besought him to come to his house, 
LUK.8.42	for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying.
LUK.8.42	As he went, the people pressed round him. 
LUK.8.43	And a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years
LUK.8.44	came up behind him, and touched the fringe of his garment; and immediately her flow of blood ceased. 
LUK.8.45	 And Jesus said, “Who was it that touched me?” When all denied it, Peter
LUK.8.46	 But Jesus said, “Some one touched me; for I perceive that power has gone forth from me.” 
LUK.8.47	And when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed. 
LUK.8.48	 And he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.”
LUK.8.49	While he was still speaking, a man from the ruler's house came and said, “Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher any more.” 
LUK.8.50	But Jesus on hearing this answered him, “Do not fear; only believe, and she shall be well.” 
LUK.8.51	And when he came to the house, he permitted no one to enter with him, except Peter and John and James, and the father and mother of the child. 
LUK.8.52	And all were weeping and bewailing her; but he said, “Do not weep; for she is not dead but sleeping.” 
LUK.8.53	And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. 
LUK.8.54	But taking her by the hand he called, saying, “Child, arise.” 
LUK.8.55	And her spirit returned, and she got up at once; and he directed that something should be given her to eat. 
LUK.8.56	 And her parents were amazed; but he charged them to tell no one what had happened.
LUK.9.2	and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal. 
LUK.9.3	And he said to them, “Take nothing for your journey, no staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics. 
LUK.9.4	And whatever house you enter, stay there, and from there depart. 
LUK.9.5	 And wherever they do not receive you, when you leave that town shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.” 
LUK.9.6	And they departed and went through the villages, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.
LUK.9.8	by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen. 
LUK.9.9	 Herod said, “John I beheaded; but who is this about whom I hear such things?” And he sought to see him.
LUK.9.11	 When the crowds learned it, they followed him; and he welcomed them and spoke to them of the kingdom of God, and cured those who had need of healing. 
LUK.9.12	Now the day began to wear away; and the twelve came and said to him, “Send the crowd away, to go into the villages and country round about, to lodge and get provisions; for we are here in a lonely place.” 
LUK.9.13	 But he said to them, “You give them something to eat.” They said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish—unless we are to go and buy food for all these people.” 
LUK.9.14	For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, “Make them sit down in companies, about fifty each.” 
LUK.9.15	And they did so, and made them all sit down. 
LUK.9.16	 And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven, and blessed and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd. 
LUK.9.17	And all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what was left over, twelve baskets of broken pieces.
LUK.9.19	 And they answered, “John the Baptist; but others say, Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets has risen.” 
LUK.9.20	And he said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” And Peter answered, “The Christ of God.” 
LUK.9.21	But he charged and commanded them to tell this to no one, 
LUK.9.22	 saying, “The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.”
LUK.9.24	 For whoever would save his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake, he will save it. 
LUK.9.25	For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself? 
LUK.9.26	 For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. 
LUK.9.27	 But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.”
LUK.9.29	And as he was praying, the appearance of his countenance was altered, and his raiment became dazzling white. 
LUK.9.30	 And behold, two men talked with him, Moses and Elijah, 
LUK.9.31	who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was to accomplish at Jerusalem. 
LUK.9.32	 Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, and when they wakened they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him. 
LUK.9.33	 And as the men were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is well that we are here; let us make three booths, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah”—not knowing what he said. 
LUK.9.34	As he said this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. 
LUK.9.35	 And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, my Chosen;
LUK.9.36	 And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silence and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.
LUK.9.38	And behold, a man from the crowd cried, “Teacher, I beg you to look upon my son, for he is my only child; 
LUK.9.39	and behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out; it convulses him till he foams, and shatters him, and will hardly leave him. 
LUK.9.40	And I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.” 
LUK.9.41	Jesus answered, “O faithless and perverse generation, how long am I to be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.” 
LUK.9.42	While he was coming, the demon tore him and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. 
LUK.9.43	 And all were astonished at the majesty of God.
LUK.9.43	But while they were all marveling at everything he did, he said to his disciples, 
LUK.9.44	“Let these words sink into your ears; for the Son of man is to be delivered into the hands of men.” 
LUK.9.45	But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.
LUK.9.47	But when Jesus perceived the thought of their hearts, he took a child and put him by his side, 
LUK.9.48	 and said to them, “Whoever receives this child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me; for he who is least among you all is the one who is great.”
LUK.9.50	But Jesus said to him, “Do not forbid him; for he that is not against you is for you.”
LUK.9.52	 And he sent messengers ahead of him, who went and entered a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him; 
LUK.9.53	but the people would not receive him, because his face was set toward Jerusalem. 
LUK.9.54	 And when his disciples James and John saw it, they said, “Lord, do you want us to bid fire come down from heaven and consume them?”
LUK.9.55	But he turned and rebuked them.
LUK.9.56	And they went on to another village.
LUK.9.58	And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.” 
LUK.9.59	To another he said, “Follow me.” But he said, “Lord, let me first go and bury my father.” 
LUK.9.60	But he said to him, “Leave the dead to bury their own dead; but as for you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.” 
LUK.9.61	 Another said, “I will follow you, Lord; but let me first say farewell to those at my home.” 
LUK.9.62	Jesus said to him, “No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.”
LUK.10.2	 And he said to them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. 
LUK.10.3	 Go your way; behold, I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves. 
LUK.10.4	Carry no purse, no bag, no sandals; and salute no one on the road. 
LUK.10.5	 Whatever house you enter, first say, ‘Peace be to this house!’ 
LUK.10.6	And if a son of peace is there, your peace shall rest upon him; but if not, it shall return to you. 
LUK.10.7	 And remain in the same house, eating and drinking what they provide, for the laborer deserves his wages; do not go from house to house. 
LUK.10.8	Whenever you enter a town and they receive you, eat what is set before you; 
LUK.10.9	heal the sick in it and say to them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near to you.’ 
LUK.10.10	But whenever you enter a town and they do not receive you, go into its streets and say, 
LUK.10.11	 ‘Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet, we wipe off against you; nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God has come near.’ 
LUK.10.12	 I tell you, it shall be more tolerable on that day for Sodom than for that town.
LUK.10.14	But it shall be more tolerable in the judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you. 
LUK.10.15	And you, Caperna-um, will you be exalted to heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades.
LUK.10.17	The seventy
LUK.10.18	 And he said to them, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. 
LUK.10.19	Behold, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall hurt you. 
LUK.10.20	 Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”
LUK.10.22	 All things have been delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, or who the Father is except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.”
LUK.10.24	For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.”
LUK.10.26	He said to him, “What is written in the law? How do you read?” 
LUK.10.27	 And he answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.” 
LUK.10.28	 And he said to him, “You have answered right; do this, and you will live.”
LUK.10.29	But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?” 
LUK.10.30	Jesus replied, “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. 
LUK.10.31	Now by chance a priest was going down that road; and when he saw him he passed by on the other side. 
LUK.10.32	So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. 
LUK.10.33	 But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was; and when he saw him, he had compassion, 
LUK.10.34	and went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; then he set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. 
LUK.10.35	And the next day he took out two denarii
LUK.10.36	Which of these three, do you think, proved neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?” 
LUK.10.37	He said, “The one who showed mercy on him.” And Jesus said to him, “Go and do likewise.”
LUK.10.39	And she had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching. 
LUK.10.40	But Martha was distracted with much serving; and she went to him and said, “Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to help me.” 
LUK.10.41	 But the Lord answered her, “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things; 
LUK.10.42	one thing is needful.
LUK.11.2	 And he said to them, “When you pray, say:
LUK.11.2	“Father, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. 
LUK.11.3	Give us each day our daily bread;
LUK.11.4	 and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive every one who is indebted to us; and lead us not into temptation.”
LUK.11.6	for a friend of mine has arrived on a journey, and I have nothing to set before him’; 
LUK.11.7	and he will answer from within, ‘Do not bother me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything’? 
LUK.11.8	I tell you, though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him whatever he needs. 
LUK.11.10	For every one who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. 
LUK.11.11	What father among you, if his son asks for
LUK.11.12	or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? 
LUK.11.13	If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”
LUK.11.15	But some of them said, “He casts out demons by Be-elzebul, the prince of demons”; 
LUK.11.16	 while others, to test him, sought from him a sign from heaven. 
LUK.11.17	But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and a divided household falls. 
LUK.11.18	And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Be-elzebul. 
LUK.11.19	And if I cast out demons by Be-elzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges. 
LUK.11.20	But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. 
LUK.11.21	When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his goods are in peace; 
LUK.11.22	but when one stronger than he assails him and overcomes him, he takes away his armor in which he trusted, and divides his spoil. 
LUK.11.23	 He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.
LUK.11.25	And when he comes he finds it swept and put in order. 
LUK.11.26	Then he goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.”
LUK.11.28	 But he said, “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!”
LUK.11.30	For as Jonah became a sign to the men of Nineveh, so will the Son of man be to this generation. 
LUK.11.31	 The queen of the South will arise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here. 
LUK.11.32	 The men of Nineveh will arise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
LUK.11.34	 Your eye is the lamp of your body; when your eye is sound, your whole body is full of light; but when it is not sound, your body is full of darkness. 
LUK.11.35	Therefore be careful lest the light in you be darkness. 
LUK.11.36	If then your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly bright, as when a lamp with its rays gives you light.”
LUK.11.38	 The Pharisee was astonished to see that he did not first wash before dinner. 
LUK.11.40	You fools! Did not he who made the outside make the inside also? 
LUK.11.41	 But give for alms those things which are within; and behold, everything is clean for you.
LUK.11.43	 Woe to you Pharisees! for you love the best seat in the synagogues and salutations in the market places. 
LUK.11.44	 Woe to you! for you are like graves which are not seen, and men walk over them without knowing it.”
LUK.11.45	One of the lawyers answered him, “Teacher, in saying this you reproach us also.” 
LUK.11.46	 And he said, “Woe to you lawyers also! for you load men with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers. 
LUK.11.47	 Woe to you! for you build the tombs of the prophets whom your fathers killed. 
LUK.11.48	So you are witnesses and consent to the deeds of your fathers; for they killed them, and you build their tombs. 
LUK.11.50	that the blood of all the prophets, shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation, 
LUK.11.51	 from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it shall be required of this generation. 
LUK.11.52	 Woe to you lawyers! for you have taken away the key of knowledge; you did not enter yourselves, and you hindered those who were entering.”
LUK.11.54	lying in wait for him, to catch at something he might say.
LUK.12.2	 Nothing is covered up that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. 
LUK.12.3	Therefore whatever you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in private rooms shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.
LUK.12.5	 But I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has power to cast into hell;
LUK.12.6	Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten before God. 
LUK.12.7	 Why, even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not; you are of more value than many sparrows.
LUK.12.8	“And I tell you, every one who acknowledges me before men, the Son of man also will acknowledge before the angels of God; 
LUK.12.9	 but he who denies me before men will be denied before the angels of God. 
LUK.12.10	 And every one who speaks a word against the Son of man will be forgiven; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. 
LUK.12.11	 And when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not be anxious how or what you are to answer or what you are to say; 
LUK.12.12	for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.”
LUK.12.13	One of the multitude said to him, “Teacher, bid my brother divide the inheritance with me.” 
LUK.12.14	But he said to him, “Man, who made me a judge or divider over you?” 
LUK.12.15	 And he said to them, “Take heed, and beware of all covetousness; for a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.” 
LUK.12.16	And he told them a parable, saying, “The land of a rich man brought forth plentifully; 
LUK.12.17	and he thought to himself, ‘What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?’ 
LUK.12.18	And he said, ‘I will do this: I will pull down my barns, and build larger ones; and there I will store all my grain and my goods. 
LUK.12.19	And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, be merry.’ 
LUK.12.20	 But God said to him, ‘Fool! This night your soul is required of you; and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?’ 
LUK.12.21	So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.”
LUK.12.23	For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing. 
LUK.12.24	 Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds! 
LUK.12.25	And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his span of life?
LUK.12.26	If then you are not able to do as small a thing as that, why are you anxious about the rest? 
LUK.12.27	 Consider the lilies, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin;
LUK.12.28	But if God so clothes the grass which is alive in the field today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O men of little faith! 
LUK.12.29	And do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink, nor be of anxious mind. 
LUK.12.30	 For all the nations of the world seek these things; and your Father knows that you need them. 
LUK.12.31	Instead, seek his
LUK.12.33	 Sell your possessions, and give alms; provide yourselves with purses that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys. 
LUK.12.34	For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
LUK.12.36	and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the marriage feast, so that they may open to him at once when he comes and knocks. 
LUK.12.37	 Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes; truly, I say to you, he will gird himself and have them sit at table, and he will come and serve them. 
LUK.12.38	If he comes in the second watch, or in the third, and finds them so, blessed are those servants! 
LUK.12.39	 But know this, that if the householder had known at what hour the thief was coming, he
LUK.12.40	You also must be ready; for the Son of man is coming at an unexpected hour.”
LUK.12.41	Peter said, “Lord, are you telling this parable for us or for all?” 
LUK.12.43	Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes will find so doing. 
LUK.12.44	Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions. 
LUK.12.45	But if that servant says to himself, ‘My master is delayed in coming,’ and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink and get drunk, 
LUK.12.46	the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will punish
LUK.12.47	 And that servant who knew his master's will, but did not make ready or act according to his will, shall receive a severe beating. 
LUK.12.48	But he who did not know, and did what deserved a beating, shall receive a light beating. Every one to whom much is given, of him will much be required; and of him to whom men commit much they will demand the more.
LUK.12.50	 I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how I am constrained until it is accomplished! 
LUK.12.51	 Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division; 
LUK.12.52	for henceforth in one house there will be five divided, three against two and two against three; 
LUK.12.53	they will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against her mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.”
LUK.12.55	And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, ‘There will be scorching heat’; and it happens. 
LUK.12.56	You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky; but why do you not know how to interpret the present time?
LUK.12.58	As you go with your accuser before the magistrate, make an effort to settle with him on the way, lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and the officer put you in prison. 
LUK.12.59	I tell you, you will never get out till you have paid the very last copper.”
LUK.13.1	There were some present at that very time who told him of the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. 
LUK.13.2	 And he answered them, “Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered thus? 
LUK.13.3	I tell you, No; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish. 
LUK.13.4	Or those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who dwelt in Jerusalem? 
LUK.13.5	I tell you, No; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.”
LUK.13.7	 And he said to the vinedresser, ‘Lo, these three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and I find none. Cut it down; why should it use up the ground?’ 
LUK.13.8	And he answered him, ‘Let it alone, sir, this year also, till I dig about it and put on manure. 
LUK.13.9	And if it bears fruit next year, well and good; but if not, you can cut it down.’ ”
LUK.13.10	Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath. 
LUK.13.11	And there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity for eighteen years; she was bent over and could not fully straighten herself. 
LUK.13.12	And when Jesus saw her, he called her and said to her, “Woman, you are freed from your infirmity.” 
LUK.13.13	And he laid his hands upon her, and immediately she was made straight, and she praised God. 
LUK.13.14	 But the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the sabbath, said to the people, “There are six days on which work ought to be done; come on those days and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.” 
LUK.13.15	 Then the Lord answered him, “You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his ass from the manger, and lead it away to water it? 
LUK.13.16	 And ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?” 
LUK.13.17	As he said this, all his adversaries were put to shame; and all the people rejoiced at all the glorious things that were done by him.
LUK.13.19	It is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his garden; and it grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air made nests in its branches.”
LUK.13.21	It is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till it was all leavened.”
LUK.13.23	 And some one said to him, “Lord, will those who are saved be few?” And he said to them, 
LUK.13.24	“Strive to enter by the narrow door; for many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able. 
LUK.13.25	 When once the householder has risen up and shut the door, you will begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, ‘Lord, open to us.’ He will answer you, ‘I do not know where you come from.’ 
LUK.13.26	 Then you will begin to say, ‘We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.’ 
LUK.13.27	But he will say, ‘I tell you, I do not know where you come from; depart from me, all you workers of iniquity!’ 
LUK.13.28	 There you will weep and gnash your teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God and you yourselves thrust out. 
LUK.13.29	And men will come from east and west, and from north and south, and sit at table in the kingdom of God. 
LUK.13.30	 And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.”
LUK.13.31	At that very hour some Pharisees came, and said to him, “Get away from here, for Herod wants to kill you.” 
LUK.13.32	 And he said to them, “Go and tell that fox, ‘Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I finish my course. 
LUK.13.33	Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the day following; for it cannot be that a prophet should perish away from Jerusalem.’ 
LUK.13.34	 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets and stoning those who are sent to you! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not! 
LUK.13.35	 Behold, your house is forsaken. And I tell you, you will not see me until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!’ ”
LUK.14.2	And behold, there was a man before him who had dropsy. 
LUK.14.3	 And Jesus spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, “Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath, or not?” 
LUK.14.4	But they were silent. Then he took him and healed him, and let him go. 
LUK.14.5	 And he said to them, “Which of you, having a son
LUK.14.6	And they could not reply to this.
LUK.14.7	Now he told a parable to those who were invited, when he marked how they chose the places of honor, saying to them, 
LUK.14.8	 “When you are invited by any one to a marriage feast, do not sit down in a place of honor, lest a more eminent man than you be invited by him; 
LUK.14.9	and he who invited you both will come and say to you, ‘Give place to this man,’ and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place. 
LUK.14.10	But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when your host comes he may say to you, ‘Friend, go up higher’; then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at table with you. 
LUK.14.11	 For every one who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.”
LUK.14.13	 But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind, 
LUK.14.14	and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. You will be repaid at the resurrection of the just.”
LUK.14.16	 But he said to him, “A man once gave a great banquet, and invited many; 
LUK.14.17	and at the time for the banquet he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited, ‘Come; for all is now ready.’ 
LUK.14.18	But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, ‘I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it; I pray you, have me excused.’ 
LUK.14.19	And another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to examine them; I pray you, have me excused.’ 
LUK.14.20	 And another said, ‘I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.’ 
LUK.14.21	 So the servant came and reported this to his master. Then the householder in anger said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly to the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor and maimed and blind and lame.’ 
LUK.14.22	And the servant said, ‘Sir, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.’ 
LUK.14.23	And the master said to the servant, ‘Go out to the highways and hedges, and compel people to come in, that my house may be filled. 
LUK.14.24	For I tell you,
LUK.14.25	Now great multitudes accompanied him; and he turned and said to them, 
LUK.14.26	 “If any one comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple. 
LUK.14.27	 Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me, cannot be my disciple. 
LUK.14.28	For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it? 
LUK.14.29	Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him, 
LUK.14.30	saying, ‘This man began to build, and was not able to finish.’ 
LUK.14.31	Or what king, going to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand? 
LUK.14.32	And if not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an embassy and asks terms of peace. 
LUK.14.33	 So therefore, whoever of you does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple.
LUK.14.35	It is fit neither for the land nor for the dunghill; men throw it away. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”
LUK.15.2	And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, “This man receives sinners and eats with them.”
LUK.15.3	So he told them this parable: 
LUK.15.4	 “What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one which is lost, until he finds it? 
LUK.15.5	And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. 
LUK.15.6	And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.’ 
LUK.15.7	 Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.
LUK.15.8	“Or what woman, having ten silver coins,
LUK.15.9	And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I had lost.’ 
LUK.15.10	Just so, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”
LUK.15.12	 and the younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the share of property that falls to me.’ And he divided his living between them. 
LUK.15.13	Not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had and took his journey into a far country, and there he squandered his property in loose living. 
LUK.15.14	And when he had spent everything, a great famine arose in that country, and he began to be in want. 
LUK.15.15	So he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed swine. 
LUK.15.16	And he would gladly have fed on
LUK.15.17	But when he came to himself he said, ‘How many of my father's hired servants have bread enough and to spare, but I perish here with hunger! 
LUK.15.18	I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; 
LUK.15.19	I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me as one of your hired servants.” ’ 
LUK.15.20	And he arose and came to his father. But while he was yet at a distance, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him. 
LUK.15.21	And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’
LUK.15.22	 But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet; 
LUK.15.23	and bring the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and make merry; 
LUK.15.24	 for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.’ And they began to make merry.
LUK.15.25	“Now his elder son was in the field; and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing. 
LUK.15.26	And he called one of the servants and asked what this meant. 
LUK.15.27	And he said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him safe and sound.’ 
LUK.15.28	But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and entreated him, 
LUK.15.29	but he answered his father, ‘Lo, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command; yet you never gave me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends. 
LUK.15.30	But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your living with harlots, you killed for him the fatted calf!’ 
LUK.15.31	And he said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. 
LUK.15.32	It was fitting to make merry and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found.’ ”
LUK.16.1	He also said to the disciples, “There was a rich man who had a steward, and charges were brought to him that this man was wasting his goods. 
LUK.16.2	And he called him and said to him, ‘What is this that I hear about you? Turn in the account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward.’ 
LUK.16.3	And the steward said to himself, ‘What shall I do, since my master is taking the stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. 
LUK.16.4	I have decided what to do, so that people may receive me into their houses when I am put out of the stewardship.’ 
LUK.16.5	So, summoning his master's debtors one by one, he said to the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’ 
LUK.16.6	He said, ‘A hundred measures of oil.’ And he said to him, ‘Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.’ 
LUK.16.7	Then he said to another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ He said, ‘A hundred measures of wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and write eighty.’ 
LUK.16.8	 The master commended the dishonest steward for his shrewdness; for the sons of this world
LUK.16.9	 And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous mammon,
LUK.16.11	If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon,
LUK.16.12	And if you have not been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own? 
LUK.16.13	 No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.”
LUK.16.14	The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all this, and they scoffed at him. 
LUK.16.15	 But he said to them, “You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts; for what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.
LUK.16.17	 But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one dot of the law to become void.
LUK.16.19	“There was a rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. 
LUK.16.20	 And at his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus, full of sores, 
LUK.16.21	who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table; moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. 
LUK.16.22	 The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died and was buried; 
LUK.16.23	and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes, and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus in his bosom. 
LUK.16.24	And he called out, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy upon me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame.’ 
LUK.16.25	 But Abraham said, ‘Son, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish. 
LUK.16.26	And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us.’ 
LUK.16.27	And he said, ‘Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father's house, 
LUK.16.28	for I have five brothers, so that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment.’ 
LUK.16.29	 But Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.’ 
LUK.16.30	 And he said, ‘No, father Abraham; but if some one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’ 
LUK.16.31	He said to him, ‘If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced if some one should rise from the dead.’ ”
LUK.17.2	It would be better for him if a millstone were hung round his neck and he were cast into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin.
LUK.17.3	 Take heed to yourselves; if your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him; 
LUK.17.4	and if he sins against you seven times in the day, and turns to you seven times, and says, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive him.”
LUK.17.6	And the Lord said, “If you had faith as a grain of mustard seed, you could say to this sycamine tree, ‘Be rooted up, and be planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you.
LUK.17.7	“Will any one of you, who has a servant plowing or keeping sheep, say to him when he has come in from the field, ‘Come at once and sit down at table’? 
LUK.17.8	 Will he not rather say to him, ‘Prepare supper for me, and gird yourself and serve me, till I eat and drink; and afterward you shall eat and drink’? 
LUK.17.9	Does he thank the servant because he did what was commanded? 
LUK.17.10	So you also, when you have done all that is commanded you, say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done what was our duty.’ ”
LUK.17.12	 And as he entered a village, he was met by ten lepers, who stood at a distance 
LUK.17.13	 and lifted up their voices and said, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.” 
LUK.17.14	 When he saw them he said to them, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” And as they went they were cleansed. 
LUK.17.15	Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice; 
LUK.17.16	and he fell on his face at Jesus' feet, giving him thanks. Now he was a Samaritan. 
LUK.17.17	Then said Jesus, “Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine? 
LUK.17.18	Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?” 
LUK.17.19	 And he said to him, “Rise and go your way; your faith has made you well.”
LUK.17.21	nor will they say, ‘Lo, here it is!’ or ‘There!’ for behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you.”
LUK.17.23	 And they will say to you, ‘Lo, there!’ or ‘Lo, here!’ Do not go, do not follow them. 
LUK.17.24	 For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so will the Son of man be in his day.
LUK.17.25	 But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation. 
LUK.17.26	 As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the Son of man. 
LUK.17.27	They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. 
LUK.17.28	 Likewise as it was in the days of Lot—they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built, 
LUK.17.29	but on the day when Lot went out from Sodom fire and sulphur rained from heaven and destroyed them all— 
LUK.17.30	so will it be on the day when the Son of man is revealed. 
LUK.17.31	 On that day, let him who is on the housetop, with his goods in the house, not come down to take them away; and likewise let him who is in the field not turn back. 
LUK.17.32	 Remember Lot's wife. 
LUK.17.33	 Whoever seeks to gain his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will preserve it. 
LUK.17.34	 I tell you, in that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other left. 
LUK.17.35	There will be two women grinding together; one will be taken and the other left.” 
LUK.17.37	 And they said to him, “Where, Lord?” He said to them, “Where the body is, there the eagles
LUK.18.2	He said, “In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor regarded man; 
LUK.18.3	and there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Vindicate me against my adversary.’ 
LUK.18.4	For a while he refused; but afterward he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor regard man, 
LUK.18.5	yet because this widow bothers me, I will vindicate her, or she will wear me out by her continual coming.’ ” 
LUK.18.6	 And the Lord said, “Hear what the unrighteous judge says. 
LUK.18.7	 And will not God vindicate his elect, who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long over them? 
LUK.18.8	I tell you, he will vindicate them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man comes, will he find faith on earth?”
LUK.18.9	He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others: 
LUK.18.10	“Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 
LUK.18.11	 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, ‘God, I thank thee that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. 
LUK.18.12	 I fast twice a week, I give tithes of all that I get.’ 
LUK.18.13	But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me a sinner!’ 
LUK.18.14	 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for every one who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.”
LUK.18.16	But Jesus called them to him, saying, “Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God. 
LUK.18.17	Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.”
LUK.18.19	And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. 
LUK.18.20	 You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.’ ” 
LUK.18.21	And he said, “All these I have observed from my youth.” 
LUK.18.22	 And when Jesus heard it, he said to him, “One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” 
LUK.18.23	But when he heard this he became sad, for he was very rich. 
LUK.18.24	 Jesus looking at him said, “How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God! 
LUK.18.25	For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.” 
LUK.18.26	Those who heard it said, “Then who can be saved?” 
LUK.18.27	 But he said, “What is impossible with men is possible with God.” 
LUK.18.28	 And Peter said, “Lo, we have left our homes and followed you.” 
LUK.18.29	And he said to them, “Truly, I say to you, there is no man who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God, 
LUK.18.30	who will not receive manifold more in this time, and in the age to come eternal life.”
LUK.18.32	For he will be delivered to the Gentiles, and will be mocked and shamefully treated and spit upon; 
LUK.18.33	they will scourge him and kill him, and on the third day he will rise.” 
LUK.18.34	But they understood none of these things; this saying was hid from them, and they did not grasp what was said.
LUK.18.36	and hearing a multitude going by, he inquired what this meant. 
LUK.18.37	They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.” 
LUK.18.38	And he cried, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” 
LUK.18.39	And those who were in front rebuked him, telling him to be silent; but he cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” 
LUK.18.40	And Jesus stopped, and commanded him to be brought to him; and when he came near, he asked him, 
LUK.18.41	“What do you want me to do for you?” He said, “Lord, let me receive my sight.” 
LUK.18.42	 And Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your faith has made you well.” 
LUK.18.43	And immediately he received his sight and followed him, glorifying God; and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.
LUK.19.2	And there was a man named Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector, and rich. 
LUK.19.3	And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not, on account of the crowd, because he was small of stature. 
LUK.19.4	So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way. 
LUK.19.5	And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, make haste and come down; for I must stay at your house today.” 
LUK.19.6	So he made haste and came down, and received him joyfully. 
LUK.19.7	 And when they saw it they all murmured, “He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.” 
LUK.19.8	 And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have defrauded any one of anything, I restore it fourfold.” 
LUK.19.9	 And Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham. 
LUK.19.10	For the Son of man came to seek and to save the lost.”
LUK.19.13	Calling ten of his servants, he gave them ten pounds,
LUK.19.14	But his citizens hated him and sent an embassy after him, saying, ‘We do not want this man to reign over us.’ 
LUK.19.15	When he returned, having received the kingdom, he commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by trading. 
LUK.19.16	The first came before him, saying, ‘Lord, your pound has made ten pounds more.’ 
LUK.19.17	 And he said to him, ‘Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.’ 
LUK.19.18	And the second came, saying, ‘Lord, your pound has made five pounds.’ 
LUK.19.19	And he said to him, ‘And you are to be over five cities.’ 
LUK.19.20	Then another came, saying, ‘Lord, here is your pound, which I kept laid away in a napkin; 
LUK.19.21	for I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man; you take up what you did not lay down, and reap what you did not sow.’ 
LUK.19.22	He said to him, ‘I will condemn you out of your own mouth, you wicked servant! You knew that I was a severe man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow? 
LUK.19.23	Why then did you not put my money into the bank, and at my coming I should have collected it with interest?’ 
LUK.19.24	And he said to those who stood by, ‘Take the pound from him, and give it to him who has the ten pounds.’ 
LUK.19.25	(And they said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten pounds!’) 
LUK.19.26	 ‘I tell you, that to every one who has will more be given; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away. 
LUK.19.27	But as for these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me.’ ”
LUK.19.29	 When he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples, 
LUK.19.30	saying, “Go into the village opposite, where on entering you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever yet sat; untie it and bring it here. 
LUK.19.31	If any one asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ you shall say this, ‘The Lord has need of it.’ ” 
LUK.19.32	 So those who were sent went away and found it as he had told them. 
LUK.19.33	And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?” 
LUK.19.34	 And they said, “The Lord has need of it.” 
LUK.19.35	And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their garments on the colt they set Jesus upon it. 
LUK.19.36	 And as he rode along, they spread their garments on the road. 
LUK.19.37	As he was now drawing near, at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen, 
LUK.19.38	 saying, “Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!” 
LUK.19.39	 And some of the Pharisees in the multitude said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples.” 
LUK.19.40	He answered, “I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out.”
LUK.19.42	saying, “Would that even today you knew the things that make for peace! But now they are hid from your eyes. 
LUK.19.43	 For the days shall come upon you, when your enemies will cast up a bank about you and surround you, and hem you in on every side, 
LUK.19.44	 and dash you to the ground, you and your children within you, and they will not leave one stone upon another in you; because you did not know the time of your visitation.”
LUK.19.46	saying to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be a house of prayer’; but you have made it a den of robbers.”
LUK.19.48	but they did not find anything they could do, for all the people hung upon his words.
LUK.20.2	 and said to him, “Tell us by what authority you do these things, or who it is that gave you this authority.” 
LUK.20.3	He answered them, “I also will ask you a question; now tell me, 
LUK.20.4	Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?” 
LUK.20.5	And they discussed it with one another, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why did you not believe him?’ 
LUK.20.6	 But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us; for they are convinced that John was a prophet.” 
LUK.20.7	So they answered that they did not know whence it was. 
LUK.20.8	And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”
LUK.20.10	When the time came, he sent a servant to the tenants, that they should give him some of the fruit of the vineyard; but the tenants beat him, and sent him away empty-handed. 
LUK.20.11	And he sent another servant; him also they beat and treated shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed. 
LUK.20.12	And he sent yet a third; this one they wounded and cast out. 
LUK.20.13	Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; it may be they will respect him.’ 
LUK.20.14	But when the tenants saw him, they said to themselves, ‘This is the heir; let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.’ 
LUK.20.15	And they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? 
LUK.20.16	 He will come and destroy those tenants, and give the vineyard to others.” When they heard this, they said, “God forbid!” 
LUK.20.17	 But he looked at them and said, “What then is this that is written:
LUK.20.17	‘The very stone which the builders rejected
LUK.20.17	has become the head of the corner’?
LUK.20.20	 So they watched him, and sent spies, who pretended to be sincere, that they might take hold of what he said, so as to deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor. 
LUK.20.21	 They asked him, “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and show no partiality, but truly teach the way of God. 
LUK.20.22	Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?” 
LUK.20.23	But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, 
LUK.20.24	“Show me a coin.
LUK.20.25	 He said to them, “Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.” 
LUK.20.26	And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch him by what he said; but marveling at his answer they were silent.
LUK.20.28	 and they asked him a question, saying, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies, having a wife but no children, the man
LUK.20.29	Now there were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and died without children; 
LUK.20.30	and the second 
LUK.20.31	and the third took her, and likewise all seven left no children and died. 
LUK.20.32	Afterward the woman also died. 
LUK.20.33	In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For the seven had her as wife.”
LUK.20.34	And Jesus said to them, “The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage; 
LUK.20.35	but those who are accounted worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage, 
LUK.20.36	for they cannot die any more, because they are equal to angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection. 
LUK.20.37	 But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the passage about the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. 
LUK.20.38	Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living; for all live to him.” 
LUK.20.39	 And some of the scribes answered, “Teacher, you have spoken well.” 
LUK.20.40	 For they no longer dared to ask him any question.
LUK.20.42	For David himself says in the Book of Psalms,
LUK.20.42	‘The Lord said to my Lord,
LUK.20.42	Sit at my right hand,
LUK.20.43	till I make thy enemies a stool for thy feet.’
LUK.20.44	David thus calls him Lord; so how is he his son?”
LUK.20.46	“Beware of the scribes, who like to go about in long robes, and love salutations in the market places and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts, 
LUK.20.47	who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.”
LUK.21.2	and he saw a poor widow put in two copper coins. 
LUK.21.3	And he said, “Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all of them; 
LUK.21.4	for they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all the living that she had.”
LUK.21.6	 “As for these things which you see, the days will come when there shall not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.” 
LUK.21.7	 And they asked him, “Teacher, when will this be, and what will be the sign when this is about to take place?” 
LUK.21.8	 And he said, “Take heed that you are not led astray; for many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he!’ and, ‘The time is at hand!’ Do not go after them. 
LUK.21.9	And when you hear of wars and tumults, do not be terrified; for this must first take place, but the end will not be at once.”
LUK.21.11	there will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences; and there will be terrors and great signs from heaven. 
LUK.21.13	 This will be a time for you to bear testimony. 
LUK.21.14	 Settle it therefore in your minds, not to meditate beforehand how to answer; 
LUK.21.15	for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict. 
LUK.21.16	 You will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and kinsmen and friends, and some of you they will put to death; 
LUK.21.17	 you will be hated by all for my name's sake. 
LUK.21.18	 But not a hair of your head will perish. 
LUK.21.19	 By your endurance you will gain your lives.
LUK.21.21	Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are inside the city depart, and let not those who are out in the country enter it; 
LUK.21.22	for these are days of vengeance, to fulfil all that is written. 
LUK.21.23	 Alas for those who are with child and for those who give suck in those days! For great distress shall be upon the earth and wrath upon this people; 
LUK.21.24	 they will fall by the edge of the sword, and be led captive among all nations; and Jerusalem will be trodden down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
LUK.21.26	men fainting with fear and with foreboding of what is coming on the world; for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 
LUK.21.27	 And then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. 
LUK.21.28	 Now when these things begin to take place, look up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”
LUK.21.30	as soon as they come out in leaf, you see for yourselves and know that the summer is already near. 
LUK.21.31	So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that the kingdom of God is near. 
LUK.21.32	 Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away till all has taken place. 
LUK.21.33	 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
LUK.21.35	for it will come upon all who dwell upon the face of the whole earth. 
LUK.21.36	 But watch at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that will take place, and to stand before the Son of man.”
LUK.21.38	And early in the morning all the people came to him in the temple to hear him.
LUK.22.2	And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to put him to death; for they feared the people.
LUK.22.3	Then Satan entered into Judas called Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve; 
LUK.22.4	he went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers how he might betray him to them. 
LUK.22.5	 And they were glad, and engaged to give him money. 
LUK.22.6	So he agreed, and sought an opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of the multitude.
LUK.22.8	 So Jesus
LUK.22.9	They said to him, “Where will you have us prepare it?” 
LUK.22.10	He said to them, “Behold, when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him into the house which he enters, 
LUK.22.11	and tell the householder, ‘The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room, where I am to eat the passover with my disciples?’ 
LUK.22.12	And he will show you a large upper room furnished; there make ready.” 
LUK.22.13	And they went, and found it as he had told them; and they prepared the passover.
LUK.22.15	 And he said to them, “I have earnestly desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer; 
LUK.22.16	 for I tell you I shall not eat it
LUK.22.17	 And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he said, “Take this, and divide it among yourselves; 
LUK.22.18	 for I tell you that from now on I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.” 
LUK.22.19	 And he took bread, and when he had given thanks he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” 
LUK.22.20	And likewise the cup after supper, saying, “This cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood.
LUK.22.21	 But behold the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table. 
LUK.22.22	For the Son of man goes as it has been determined; but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!” 
LUK.22.23	And they began to question one another, which of them it was that would do this.
LUK.22.25	 And he said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors. 
LUK.22.26	 But not so with you; rather let the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves. 
LUK.22.27	For which is the greater, one who sits at table, or one who serves? Is it not the one who sits at table? But I am among you as one who serves.
LUK.22.29	 and I assign to you, as my Father assigned to me, a kingdom, 
LUK.22.30	 that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
LUK.22.32	 but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned again, strengthen your brethren.” 
LUK.22.33	 And he said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.” 
LUK.22.34	He said, “I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow this day, until you three times deny that you know me.”
LUK.22.36	 He said to them, “But now, let him who has a purse take it, and likewise a bag. And let him who has no sword sell his mantle and buy one. 
LUK.22.37	 For I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me, ‘And he was reckoned with transgressors’; for what is written about me has its fulfilment.” 
LUK.22.38	And they said, “Look, Lord, here are two swords.” And he said to them, “It is enough.”
LUK.22.41	And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and knelt down and prayed, 
LUK.22.42	 “Father, if thou art willing, remove this cup from me; nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.” 
LUK.22.45	And when he rose from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow, 
LUK.22.46	and he said to them, “Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.”
LUK.22.48	but Jesus said to him, “Judas, would you betray the Son of man with a kiss?” 
LUK.22.49	 And when those who were about him saw what would follow, they said, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?” 
LUK.22.50	And one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear. 
LUK.22.51	But Jesus said, “No more of this!” And he touched his ear and healed him. 
LUK.22.52	Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders, who had come out against him, “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs? 
LUK.22.53	 When I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.”
LUK.22.55	and when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them. 
LUK.22.56	 Then a maid, seeing him as he sat in the light and gazing at him, said, “This man also was with him.” 
LUK.22.57	But he denied it, saying, “Woman, I do not know him.” 
LUK.22.58	And a little later some one else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not.” 
LUK.22.59	And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted, saying, “Certainly this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean.” 
LUK.22.60	But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are saying.” And immediately, while he was still speaking, the cock crowed. 
LUK.22.61	 And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, “Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three times.” 
LUK.22.62	And he went out and wept bitterly.
LUK.22.64	they also blindfolded him and asked him, “Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?” 
LUK.22.65	And they spoke many other words against him, reviling him.
LUK.22.67	 “If you are the Christ, tell us.” But he said to them, “If I tell you, you will not believe; 
LUK.22.68	and if I ask you, you will not answer. 
LUK.22.69	But from now on the Son of man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God.” 
LUK.22.70	 And they all said, “Are you the Son of God, then?” And he said to them, “You say that I am.” 
LUK.22.71	And they said, “What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips.”
LUK.23.2	 And they began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king.” 
LUK.23.3	 And Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” And he answered him, “You have said so.” 
LUK.23.4	 And Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, “I find no crime in this man.” 
LUK.23.5	But they were urgent, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee even to this place.”
LUK.23.6	When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean. 
LUK.23.7	And when he learned that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time. 
LUK.23.8	 When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him, because he had heard about him, and he was hoping to see some sign done by him. 
LUK.23.9	 So he questioned him at some length; but he made no answer. 
LUK.23.10	The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him. 
LUK.23.11	 And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him; then, arraying him in gorgeous apparel, he sent him back to Pilate. 
LUK.23.12	And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before this they had been at enmity with each other.
LUK.23.13	Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, 
LUK.23.14	 and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was perverting the people; and after examining him before you, behold, I did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him; 
LUK.23.15	neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Behold, nothing deserving death has been done by him; 
LUK.23.16	 I will therefore chastise him and release him.” 
LUK.23.19	a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city, and for murder. 
LUK.23.20	Pilate addressed them once more, desiring to release Jesus; 
LUK.23.21	but they shouted out, “Crucify, crucify him!” 
LUK.23.22	A third time he said to them, “Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no crime deserving death; I will therefore chastise him and release him.” 
LUK.23.23	 But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he should be crucified. And their voices prevailed. 
LUK.23.24	So Pilate gave sentence that their demand should be granted. 
LUK.23.25	He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.
LUK.23.27	And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him. 
LUK.23.28	 But Jesus turning to them said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. 
LUK.23.29	For behold, the days are coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never gave suck!’ 
LUK.23.30	Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us’; and to the hills, ‘Cover us.’ 
LUK.23.31	For if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?”
LUK.23.32	Two others also, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him. 
LUK.23.33	 And when they came to the place which is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on the right and one on the left. 
LUK.23.34	 And Jesus said, “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.”
LUK.23.35	 And the people stood by, watching; but the rulers scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, his Chosen One!” 
LUK.23.36	 The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him vinegar, 
LUK.23.37	and saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!” 
LUK.23.38	There was also an inscription over him,
LUK.23.39	One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him, saying, “Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!” 
LUK.23.40	But the other rebuked him, saying, “Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? 
LUK.23.41	 And we indeed justly; for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.” 
LUK.23.42	And he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into
LUK.23.43	 And he said to him, “Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”
LUK.23.45	 while the sun's light failed;
LUK.23.46	 Then Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, “Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit!” And having said this he breathed his last. 
LUK.23.47	Now when the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God, and said, “Certainly this man was innocent!” 
LUK.23.48	And all the multitudes who assembled to see the sight, when they saw what had taken place, returned home beating their breasts. 
LUK.23.49	 And all his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from Galilee stood at a distance and saw these things.
LUK.23.51	who had not consented to their purpose and deed, and he was looking for the kingdom of God. 
LUK.23.52	This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 
LUK.23.53	Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud, and laid him in a rock-hewn tomb, where no one had ever yet been laid. 
LUK.23.54	It was the day of Preparation, and the sabbath was beginning.
LUK.23.55	The women who had come with him from Galilee followed, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid; 
LUK.23.56	 then they returned, and prepared spices and ointments.
LUK.23.56	On the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
LUK.24.2	And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb, 
LUK.24.3	but when they went in they did not find the body.
LUK.24.4	While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel; 
LUK.24.5	and as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead?
LUK.24.6	 Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, 
LUK.24.7	that the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise.” 
LUK.24.8	And they remembered his words, 
LUK.24.9	and returning from the tomb they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest. 
LUK.24.10	 Now it was Mary Magdalene and Jo-anna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told this to the apostles; 
LUK.24.11	but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. 
LUK.24.13	That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles
LUK.24.14	and talking with each other about all these things that had happened. 
LUK.24.15	While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. 
LUK.24.16	 But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. 
LUK.24.17	And he said to them, “What is this conversation which you are holding with each other as you walk?” And they stood still, looking sad. 
LUK.24.18	Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?” 
LUK.24.19	 And he said to them, “What things?” And they said to him, “Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, 
LUK.24.20	and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. 
LUK.24.21	But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since this happened. 
LUK.24.22	Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning 
LUK.24.23	and did not find his body; and they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. 
LUK.24.24	 Some of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women had said; but him they did not see.” 
LUK.24.25	And he said to them, “O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! 
LUK.24.26	Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?” 
LUK.24.27	 And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.
LUK.24.29	but they constrained him, saying, “Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.” So he went in to stay with them. 
LUK.24.30	 When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to them. 
LUK.24.31	And their eyes were opened and they recognized him; and he vanished out of their sight. 
LUK.24.32	They said to each other, “Did not our hearts burn within us
LUK.24.33	And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven gathered together and those who were with them, 
LUK.24.34	 who said, “The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!” 
LUK.24.35	Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.
LUK.24.37	But they were startled and frightened, and supposed that they saw a spirit. 
LUK.24.38	And he said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why do questionings rise in your hearts? 
LUK.24.39	 See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; handle me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have.” 
LUK.24.41	And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said to them, “Have you anything here to eat?” 
LUK.24.42	They gave him a piece of broiled fish, 
LUK.24.43	and he took it and ate before them.
LUK.24.45	Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures, 
LUK.24.46	 and said to them, “Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, 
LUK.24.47	 and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all nations,
LUK.24.48	You are witnesses of these things. 
LUK.24.49	 And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but stay in the city, until you are clothed with power from on high.”
LUK.24.50	Then he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them. 
LUK.24.51	 While he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.
LUK.24.52	 And they
LUK.24.53	and were continually in the temple blessing God.
JHN.1.2	He was in the beginning with God; 
JHN.1.3	 all things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made. 
JHN.1.4	 In him was life,
JHN.1.5	 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
JHN.1.7	He came for testimony, to bear witness to the light, that all might believe through him. 
JHN.1.8	He was not the light, but came to bear witness to the light.
JHN.1.10	He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world knew him not. 
JHN.1.11	He came to his own home, and his own people received him not. 
JHN.1.12	 But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God; 
JHN.1.13	 who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.
JHN.1.15	 (John bore witness to him, and cried, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before me, for he was before me.’ ”) 
JHN.1.16	 And from his fulness have we all received, grace upon grace. 
JHN.1.17	 For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 
JHN.1.18	 No one has ever seen God; the only Son,
JHN.1.20	 He confessed, he did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.” 
JHN.1.21	 And they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the prophet?” And he answered, “No.” 
JHN.1.22	They said to him then, “Who are you? Let us have an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” 
JHN.1.23	 He said, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as the prophet Isaiah said.”
JHN.1.24	Now they had been sent from the Pharisees. 
JHN.1.25	They asked him, “Then why are you baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?” 
JHN.1.26	 John answered them, “I baptize with water; but among you stands one whom you do not know, 
JHN.1.27	even he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.” 
JHN.1.28	 This took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
JHN.1.30	 This is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who ranks before me, for he was before me.’ 
JHN.1.31	I myself did not know him; but for this I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel.” 
JHN.1.32	 And John bore witness, “I saw the Spirit descend as a dove from heaven, and it remained on him. 
JHN.1.33	I myself did not know him; but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’ 
JHN.1.34	And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.”
JHN.1.36	and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!” 
JHN.1.37	The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus. 
JHN.1.38	Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, “What do you seek?” And they said to him, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are you staying?” 
JHN.1.39	He said to them, “Come and see.” They came and saw where he was staying; and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour. 
JHN.1.40	 One of the two who heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. 
JHN.1.41	 He first found his brother Simon, and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which means Christ). 
JHN.1.42	 He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said, “So you are Simon the son of John? You shall be called Cephas” (which means Peter
JHN.1.44	Now Philip was from Beth-saida, the city of Andrew and Peter. 
JHN.1.45	 Philip found Nathana-el, and said to him, “We have found him of whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” 
JHN.1.46	 Nathana-el said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.” 
JHN.1.47	Jesus saw Nathana-el coming to him, and said of him, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!” 
JHN.1.48	Nathana-el said to him, “How do you know me?” Jesus answered him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.” 
JHN.1.49	 Nathana-el answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!” 
JHN.1.50	Jesus answered him, “Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You shall see greater things than these.” 
JHN.1.51	 And he said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.”
JHN.2.2	Jesus also was invited to the marriage, with his disciples. 
JHN.2.3	 When the wine gave out, the mother of Jesus said to him, “They have no wine.” 
JHN.2.4	 And Jesus said to her, “O woman, what have you to do with me? My hour has not yet come.” 
JHN.2.5	His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.” 
JHN.2.6	 Now six stone jars were standing there, for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. 
JHN.2.7	Jesus said to them, “Fill the jars with water.” And they filled them up to the brim. 
JHN.2.8	He said to them, “Now draw some out, and take it to the steward of the feast.” So they took it. 
JHN.2.9	When the steward of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the steward of the feast called the bridegroom 
JHN.2.10	and said to him, “Every man serves the good wine first; and when men have drunk freely, then the poor wine; but you have kept the good wine until now.” 
JHN.2.11	 This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him.
JHN.2.14	 In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money-changers at their business. 
JHN.2.15	And making a whip of cords, he drove them all, with the sheep and oxen, out of the temple; and he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables. 
JHN.2.16	 And he told those who sold the pigeons, “Take these things away; you shall not make my Father's house a house of trade.” 
JHN.2.17	 His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for thy house will consume me.” 
JHN.2.18	 The Jews then said to him, “What sign have you to show us for doing this?” 
JHN.2.19	 Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” 
JHN.2.20	The Jews then said, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?” 
JHN.2.21	 But he spoke of the temple of his body. 
JHN.2.22	 When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.
JHN.2.23	Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover feast, many believed in his name when they saw the signs which he did; 
JHN.2.24	but Jesus did not trust himself to them, 
JHN.2.25	 because he knew all men and needed no one to bear witness of man; for he himself knew what was in man.
JHN.3.2	 This man came to Jesus
JHN.3.3	 Jesus answered him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born anew,
JHN.3.4	Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?” 
JHN.3.5	 Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. 
JHN.3.6	 That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
JHN.3.7	Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born anew.’
JHN.3.8	 The wind
JHN.3.9	Nicodemus said to him, “How can this be?” 
JHN.3.10	Jesus answered him, “Are you a teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand this? 
JHN.3.11	 Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen; but you do not receive our testimony. 
JHN.3.12	If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things? 
JHN.3.13	 No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended from heaven, the Son of man.
JHN.3.14	 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up, 
JHN.3.15	that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.”
JHN.3.17	 For God sent the Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him. 
JHN.3.18	He who believes in him is not condemned; he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. 
JHN.3.19	 And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. 
JHN.3.20	For every one who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. 
JHN.3.21	 But he who does what is true comes to the light, that it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been wrought in God.
JHN.3.23	John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and people came and were baptized. 
JHN.3.24	 For John had not yet been put in prison.
JHN.3.25	Now a discussion arose between John's disciples and a Jew over purifying. 
JHN.3.26	 And they came to John, and said to him, “Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you bore witness, here he is, baptizing, and all are going to him.” 
JHN.3.27	 John answered, “No one can receive anything except what is given him from heaven. 
JHN.3.28	 You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before him. 
JHN.3.29	 He who has the bride is the bridegroom; the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice; therefore this joy of mine is now full. 
JHN.3.30	He must increase, but I must decrease.”
JHN.3.32	 He bears witness to what he has seen and heard, yet no one receives his testimony; 
JHN.3.33	he who receives his testimony sets his seal to this, that God is true. 
JHN.3.34	For he whom God has sent utters the words of God, for it is not by measure that he gives the Spirit; 
JHN.3.35	the Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand. 
JHN.3.36	 He who believes in the Son has eternal life; he who does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God rests upon him.
JHN.4.2	(although Jesus himself did not baptize, but only his disciples), 
JHN.4.3	he left Judea and departed again to Galilee. 
JHN.4.4	 He had to pass through Samaria. 
JHN.4.5	 So he came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. 
JHN.4.6	Jacob's well was there, and so Jesus, wearied as he was with his journey, sat down beside the well. It was about the sixth hour.
JHN.4.7	There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give me a drink.” 
JHN.4.8	For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food. 
JHN.4.9	 The Samaritan woman said to him, “How is it that you, a Jew, ask a drink of me, a woman of Samaria?” For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans. 
JHN.4.10	 Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.” 
JHN.4.11	The woman said to him, “Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep; where do you get that living water? 
JHN.4.12	Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?” 
JHN.4.13	Jesus said to her, “Every one who drinks of this water will thirst again, 
JHN.4.14	 but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst; the water that I shall give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.” 
JHN.4.15	 The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw.”
JHN.4.16	Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come here.” 
JHN.4.17	The woman answered him, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband’; 
JHN.4.18	 for you have had five husbands, and he whom you now have is not your husband; this you said truly.” 
JHN.4.19	The woman said to him, “Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet. 
JHN.4.20	 Our fathers worshiped on this mountain; and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.” 
JHN.4.21	 Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. 
JHN.4.22	 You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. 
JHN.4.23	But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for such the Father seeks to worship him. 
JHN.4.24	 God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.” 
JHN.4.25	The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ); when he comes, he will show us all things.” 
JHN.4.26	 Jesus said to her, “I who speak to you am he.”
JHN.4.27	Just then his disciples came. They marveled that he was talking with a woman, but none said, “What do you wish?” or, “Why are you talking with her?” 
JHN.4.28	So the woman left her water jar, and went away into the city, and said to the people, 
JHN.4.29	 “Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Can this be the Christ?” 
JHN.4.30	They went out of the city and were coming to him.
JHN.4.31	Meanwhile the disciples besought him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.” 
JHN.4.32	 But he said to them, “I have food to eat of which you do not know.” 
JHN.4.33	So the disciples said to one another, “Has any one brought him food?” 
JHN.4.34	 Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work. 
JHN.4.35	 Do you not say, ‘There are yet four months, then comes the harvest’? I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see how the fields are already white for harvest. 
JHN.4.36	He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together. 
JHN.4.37	 For here the saying holds true, ‘One sows and another reaps.’ 
JHN.4.38	I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor; others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.”
JHN.4.39	Many Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the woman's testimony, “He told me all that I ever did.” 
JHN.4.40	So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them; and he stayed there two days. 
JHN.4.41	And many more believed because of his word. 
JHN.4.42	 They said to the woman, “It is no longer because of your words that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world.”
JHN.4.43	After the two days he departed to Galilee. 
JHN.4.44	 For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country. 
JHN.4.45	So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they too had gone to the feast.
JHN.4.47	When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. 
JHN.4.48	 Jesus therefore said to him, “Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.” 
JHN.4.49	The official said to him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.” 
JHN.4.50	Jesus said to him, “Go; your son will live.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went his way. 
JHN.4.51	As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was living. 
JHN.4.52	So he asked them the hour when he began to mend, and they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.” 
JHN.4.53	 The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him, “Your son will live”; and he himself believed, and all his household. 
JHN.4.54	 This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee.
JHN.5.1	After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
JHN.5.3	In these lay a multitude of invalids, blind, lame, paralyzed. 
JHN.5.5	One man was there, who had been ill for thirty-eight years. 
JHN.5.6	When Jesus saw him and knew that he had been lying there a long time, he said to him, “Do you want to be healed?” 
JHN.5.7	The sick man answered him, “Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is troubled, and while I am going another steps down before me.” 
JHN.5.8	 Jesus said to him, “Rise, take up your pallet, and walk.” 
JHN.5.9	And at once the man was healed, and he took up his pallet and walked.
JHN.5.9	Now that day was the sabbath. 
JHN.5.10	 So the Jews said to the man who was cured, “It is the sabbath, it is not lawful for you to carry your pallet.” 
JHN.5.11	But he answered them, “The man who healed me said to me, ‘Take up your pallet, and walk.’ ” 
JHN.5.12	They asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Take up your pallet, and walk’?” 
JHN.5.13	Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in the place. 
JHN.5.14	 Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, “See, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse befall you.” 
JHN.5.15	The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him. 
JHN.5.16	And this was why the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did this on the sabbath. 
JHN.5.17	 But Jesus answered them, “My Father is working still, and I am working.” 
JHN.5.18	 This was why the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the sabbath but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.
JHN.5.20	 For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all that he himself is doing; and greater works than these will he show him, that you may marvel. 
JHN.5.21	 For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will. 
JHN.5.22	The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son, 
JHN.5.23	 that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him. 
JHN.5.24	 Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word and believes him who sent me, has eternal life; he does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.
JHN.5.26	For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself, 
JHN.5.27	and has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of man. 
JHN.5.28	Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice 
JHN.5.29	 and come forth, those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.
JHN.5.31	 If I bear witness to myself, my testimony is not true; 
JHN.5.32	there is another who bears witness to me, and I know that the testimony which he bears to me is true. 
JHN.5.33	 You sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth. 
JHN.5.34	 Not that the testimony which I receive is from man; but I say this that you may be saved. 
JHN.5.35	He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light. 
JHN.5.36	 But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John; for the works which the Father has granted me to accomplish, these very works which I am doing, bear me witness that the Father has sent me. 
JHN.5.37	And the Father who sent me has himself borne witness to me. His voice you have never heard, his form you have never seen; 
JHN.5.38	and you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe him whom he has sent. 
JHN.5.39	 You search the scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness to me; 
JHN.5.40	yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life. 
JHN.5.41	I do not receive glory from men. 
JHN.5.42	But I know that you have not the love of God within you. 
JHN.5.43	 I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name, him you will receive. 
JHN.5.44	How can you believe, who receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? 
JHN.5.45	 Do not think that I shall accuse you to the Father; it is Moses who accuses you, on whom you set your hope. 
JHN.5.46	If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote of me. 
JHN.5.47	 But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?”
JHN.6.2	And a multitude followed him, because they saw the signs which he did on those who were diseased. 
JHN.6.3	Jesus went up on the mountain, and there sat down with his disciples. 
JHN.6.4	Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand. 
JHN.6.5	 Lifting up his eyes, then, and seeing that a multitude was coming to him, Jesus said to Philip, “How are we to buy bread, so that these people may eat?” 
JHN.6.6	This he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do. 
JHN.6.7	Philip answered him, “Two hundred denarii
JHN.6.8	 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him, 
JHN.6.9	 “There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what are they among so many?” 
JHN.6.10	Jesus said, “Make the people sit down.” Now there was much grass in the place; so the men sat down, in number about five thousand. 
JHN.6.11	Jesus then took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated; so also the fish, as much as they wanted. 
JHN.6.12	And when they had eaten their fill, he told his disciples, “Gather up the fragments left over, that nothing may be lost.” 
JHN.6.13	So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves, left by those who had eaten. 
JHN.6.14	 When the people saw the sign which he had done, they said, “This is indeed the prophet who is to come into the world!”
JHN.6.17	got into a boat, and started across the sea to Caperna-um. It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them. 
JHN.6.18	The sea rose because a strong wind was blowing. 
JHN.6.19	When they had rowed about three or four miles,
JHN.6.20	but he said to them, “It is I; do not be afraid.” 
JHN.6.21	Then they were glad to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.
JHN.6.22	On the next day the people who remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone. 
JHN.6.23	However, boats from Tiberi-as came near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks. 
JHN.6.24	So when the people saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats and went to Caperna-um, seeking Jesus.
JHN.6.25	When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, “Rabbi, when did you come here?” 
JHN.6.26	Jesus answered them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves. 
JHN.6.27	 Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of man will give to you; for on him has God the Father set his seal.” 
JHN.6.28	Then they said to him, “What must we do, to be doing the works of God?” 
JHN.6.29	 Jesus answered them, “This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.” 
JHN.6.30	 So they said to him, “Then what sign do you do, that we may see, and believe you? What work do you perform? 
JHN.6.31	 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’ ” 
JHN.6.32	Jesus then said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven; my Father gives you the true bread from heaven. 
JHN.6.33	For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven, and gives life to the world.” 
JHN.6.34	 They said to him, “Lord, give us this bread always.”
JHN.6.36	But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe. 
JHN.6.37	 All that the Father gives me will come to me; and him who comes to me I will not cast out. 
JHN.6.38	 For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me; 
JHN.6.39	 and this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up at the last day. 
JHN.6.40	 For this is the will of my Father, that every one who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.”
JHN.6.41	The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, “I am the bread which came down from heaven.” 
JHN.6.42	 They said, “Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?” 
JHN.6.43	Jesus answered them, “Do not murmur among yourselves. 
JHN.6.44	 No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day. 
JHN.6.45	 It is written in the prophets, ‘And they shall all be taught by God.’ Every one who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me. 
JHN.6.46	 Not that any one has seen the Father except him who is from God; he has seen the Father. 
JHN.6.47	Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life. 
JHN.6.48	I am the bread of life. 
JHN.6.49	Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. 
JHN.6.50	This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat of it and not die. 
JHN.6.51	I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any one eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh.”
JHN.6.53	So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; 
JHN.6.54	he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. 
JHN.6.55	For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. 
JHN.6.56	 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him. 
JHN.6.57	As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats me will live because of me. 
JHN.6.58	 This is the bread which came down from heaven, not such as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread will live for ever.” 
JHN.6.59	 This he said in the synagogue, as he taught at Caperna-um.
JHN.6.60	Many of his disciples, when they heard it, said, “This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?” 
JHN.6.61	 But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at it, said to them, “Do you take offense at this? 
JHN.6.62	 Then what if you were to see the Son of man ascending where he was before? 
JHN.6.63	 It is the spirit that gives life, the flesh is of no avail; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. 
JHN.6.64	 But there are some of you that do not believe.” For Jesus knew from the first who those were that did not believe, and who it was that would betray him. 
JHN.6.65	 And he said, “This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.”
JHN.6.66	After this many of his disciples drew back and no longer went about with him. 
JHN.6.67	Jesus said to the twelve, “Do you also wish to go away?” 
JHN.6.68	 Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life; 
JHN.6.69	and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.” 
JHN.6.70	 Jesus answered them, “Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?” 
JHN.6.71	 He spoke of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the twelve, was to betray him.
JHN.7.1	After this Jesus went about in Galilee; he would not go about in Judea, because the Jews
JHN.7.2	 Now the Jews' feast of Tabernacles was at hand. 
JHN.7.3	 So his brothers said to him, “Leave here and go to Judea, that your disciples may see the works you are doing. 
JHN.7.4	For no man works in secret if he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.” 
JHN.7.5	For even his brothers did not believe in him. 
JHN.7.6	 Jesus said to them, “My time has not yet come, but your time is always here. 
JHN.7.7	 The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify of it that its works are evil. 
JHN.7.8	Go to the feast yourselves; I am not
JHN.7.9	So saying, he remained in Galilee.
JHN.7.10	But after his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly but in private. 
JHN.7.11	The Jews were looking for him at the feast, and saying, “Where is he?” 
JHN.7.12	 And there was much muttering about him among the people. While some said, “He is a good man,” others said, “No, he is leading the people astray.” 
JHN.7.13	 Yet for fear of the Jews no one spoke openly of him.
JHN.7.14	About the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught. 
JHN.7.15	The Jews marveled at it, saying, “How is it that this man has learning,
JHN.7.16	So Jesus answered them, “My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me; 
JHN.7.17	if any man's will is to do his will, he shall know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority. 
JHN.7.18	He who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory; but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood. 
JHN.7.19	 Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?” 
JHN.7.20	 The people answered, “You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?” 
JHN.7.21	 Jesus answered them, “I did one deed, and you all marvel at it. 
JHN.7.22	 Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man upon the sabbath. 
JHN.7.23	 If on the sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because on the sabbath I made a man's whole body well? 
JHN.7.24	 Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.”
JHN.7.25	Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said, “Is not this the man whom they seek to kill? 
JHN.7.26	And here he is, speaking openly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ? 
JHN.7.27	 Yet we know where this man comes from; and when the Christ appears, no one will know where he comes from.” 
JHN.7.28	 So Jesus proclaimed, as he taught in the temple, “You know me, and you know where I come from? But I have not come of my own accord; he who sent me is true, and him you do not know. 
JHN.7.29	 I know him, for I come from him, and he sent me.” 
JHN.7.30	 So they sought to arrest him; but no one laid hands on him, because his hour had not yet come. 
JHN.7.31	 Yet many of the people believed in him; they said, “When the Christ appears, will he do more signs than this man has done?”
JHN.7.32	The Pharisees heard the crowd thus muttering about him, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him. 
JHN.7.33	 Jesus then said, “I shall be with you a little longer, and then I go to him who sent me; 
JHN.7.34	you will seek me and you will not find me; where I am you cannot come.” 
JHN.7.35	 The Jews said to one another, “Where does this man intend to go that we shall not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks? 
JHN.7.36	What does he mean by saying, ‘You will seek me and you will not find me,’ and, ‘Where I am you cannot come’?”
JHN.7.38	 He who believes in me, as
JHN.7.39	 Now this he said about the Spirit, which those who believed in him were to receive; for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.
JHN.7.41	Others said, “This is the Christ.” But some said, “Is the Christ to come from Galilee? 
JHN.7.42	 Has not the scripture said that the Christ is descended from David, and comes from Bethlehem, the village where David was?” 
JHN.7.43	So there was a division among the people over him. 
JHN.7.44	 Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him.
JHN.7.45	The officers then went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, “Why did you not bring him?” 
JHN.7.46	 The officers answered, “No man ever spoke like this man!” 
JHN.7.47	The Pharisees answered them, “Are you led astray, you also? 
JHN.7.48	Have any of the authorities or of the Pharisees believed in him? 
JHN.7.49	But this crowd, who do not know the law, are accursed.” 
JHN.7.50	 Nicodemus, who had gone to him before, and who was one of them, said to them, 
JHN.7.51	 “Does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he does?” 
JHN.7.52	 They replied, “Are you from Galilee too? Search and you will see that no prophet is to rise from Galilee.”
JHN.7.53	They went each to his own house,
JHN.8.1	but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 
JHN.8.2	Early in the morning he came again to the temple; all the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them. 
JHN.8.3	The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placing her in the midst 
JHN.8.4	they said to him, “Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery. 
JHN.8.5	Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such. What do you say about her?” 
JHN.8.6	This they said to test him, that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. 
JHN.8.7	And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, “Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.” 
JHN.8.8	And once more he bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. 
JHN.8.9	But when they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the eldest, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. 
JHN.8.10	Jesus looked up and said to her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?” 
JHN.8.11	She said, “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you; go, and do not sin again.”
JHN.8.13	 The Pharisees then said to him, “You are bearing witness to yourself; your testimony is not true.” 
JHN.8.14	Jesus answered, “Even if I do bear witness to myself, my testimony is true, for I know whence I have come and whither I am going, but you do not know whence I come or whither I am going. 
JHN.8.15	 You judge according to the flesh, I judge no one. 
JHN.8.16	 Yet even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for it is not I alone that judge, but I and he
JHN.8.17	 In your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true; 
JHN.8.18	I bear witness to myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness to me.” 
JHN.8.19	 They said to him therefore, “Where is your Father?” Jesus answered, “You know neither me nor my Father; if you knew me, you would know my Father also.” 
JHN.8.20	 These words he spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple; but no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.
JHN.8.22	Then said the Jews, “Will he kill himself, since he says, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come’?” 
JHN.8.23	 He said to them, “You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world. 
JHN.8.24	 I told you that you would die in your sins, for you will die in your sins unless you believe that I am he.” 
JHN.8.25	They said to him, “Who are you?” Jesus said to them, “Even what I have told you from the beginning.
JHN.8.26	I have much to say about you and much to judge; but he who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.” 
JHN.8.27	They did not understand that he spoke to them of the Father. 
JHN.8.28	 So Jesus said, “When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own authority but speak thus as the Father taught me. 
JHN.8.29	And he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what is pleasing to him.” 
JHN.8.30	 As he spoke thus, many believed in him.
JHN.8.32	 and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.” 
JHN.8.33	 They answered him, “We are descendants of Abraham, and have never been in bondage to any one. How is it that you say, ‘You will be made free’?”
JHN.8.35	 The slave does not continue in the house for ever; the son continues for ever. 
JHN.8.36	So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed. 
JHN.8.37	I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. 
JHN.8.38	I speak of what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have heard from your father.”
JHN.8.39	They answered him, “Abraham is our father.” Jesus said to them, “If you were Abraham's children, you would do what Abraham did, 
JHN.8.40	but now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God; this is not what Abraham did. 
JHN.8.41	 You do what your father did.” They said to him, “We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.” 
JHN.8.42	 Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I proceeded and came forth from God; I came not of my own accord, but he sent me. 
JHN.8.43	Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word. 
JHN.8.44	 You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has nothing to do with the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies. 
JHN.8.45	But, because I tell the truth, you do not believe me. 
JHN.8.46	 Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me? 
JHN.8.47	He who is of God hears the words of God; the reason why you do not hear them is that you are not of God.”
JHN.8.49	Jesus answered, “I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me. 
JHN.8.50	Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it and he will be the judge. 
JHN.8.51	Truly, truly, I say to you, if any one keeps my word, he will never see death.” 
JHN.8.52	The Jews said to him, “Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, as did the prophets; and you say, ‘If any one keeps my word, he will never taste death.’ 
JHN.8.53	 Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died! Who do you claim to be?” 
JHN.8.54	Jesus answered, “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing; it is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is your God. 
JHN.8.55	But you have not known him; I know him. If I said, I do not know him, I should be a liar like you; but I do know him and I keep his word. 
JHN.8.56	 Your father Abraham rejoiced that he was to see my day; he saw it and was glad.” 
JHN.8.57	 The Jews then said to him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?”
JHN.8.58	 Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.” 
JHN.8.59	 So they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.
JHN.9.1	As he passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth. 
JHN.9.2	 And his disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” 
JHN.9.3	 Jesus answered, “It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be made manifest in him. 
JHN.9.4	 We must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day; night comes, when no one can work. 
JHN.9.5	 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” 
JHN.9.6	 As he said this, he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed the man's eyes with the clay, 
JHN.9.7	 saying to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which means Sent). So he went and washed and came back seeing. 
JHN.9.8	The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar, said, “Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?” 
JHN.9.9	Some said, “It is he”; others said, “No, but he is like him.” He said, “I am the man.” 
JHN.9.10	They said to him, “Then how were your eyes opened?” 
JHN.9.11	He answered, “The man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, ‘Go to Siloam and wash’; so I went and washed and received my sight.” 
JHN.9.12	They said to him, “Where is he?” He said, “I do not know.”
JHN.9.13	They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind. 
JHN.9.14	Now it was a sabbath day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes. 
JHN.9.15	The Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. And he said to them, “He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.” 
JHN.9.16	 Some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for he does not keep the sabbath.” But others said, “How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” There was a division among them. 
JHN.9.17	So they again said to the blind man, “What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?” He said, “He is a prophet.”
JHN.9.18	The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight, 
JHN.9.19	and asked them, “Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?” 
JHN.9.20	His parents answered, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; 
JHN.9.21	but how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age, he will speak for himself.” 
JHN.9.22	 His parents said this because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if any one should confess him to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue. 
JHN.9.23	Therefore his parents said, “He is of age, ask him.”
JHN.9.24	So for the second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, “Give God the praise; we know that this man is a sinner.” 
JHN.9.25	He answered, “Whether he is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I know, that though I was blind, now I see.” 
JHN.9.26	They said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?” 
JHN.9.27	He answered them, “I have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you too want to become his disciples?” 
JHN.9.28	 And they reviled him, saying, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. 
JHN.9.29	We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.” 
JHN.9.30	The man answered, “Why, this is a marvel! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes. 
JHN.9.31	We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if any one is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens to him. 
JHN.9.32	Never since the world began has it been heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind. 
JHN.9.33	If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.” 
JHN.9.34	They answered him, “You were born in utter sin, and would you teach us?” And they cast him out.
JHN.9.35	Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him he said, “Do you believe in the Son of man?”
JHN.9.36	He answered, “And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?” 
JHN.9.37	Jesus said to him, “You have seen him, and it is he who speaks to you.” 
JHN.9.38	 He said, “Lord, I believe”; and he worshiped him. 
JHN.9.39	 Jesus said, “For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind.” 
JHN.9.40	Some of the Pharisees near him heard this, and they said to him, “Are we also blind?” 
JHN.9.41	 Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would have no guilt; but now that you say, ‘We see,’ your guilt remains.
JHN.10.1	“Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a robber; 
JHN.10.2	 but he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 
JHN.10.3	To him the gatekeeper opens; the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. 
JHN.10.4	When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. 
JHN.10.5	A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.” 
JHN.10.6	 This figure Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.
JHN.10.7	So Jesus again said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. 
JHN.10.8	 All who came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not heed them. 
JHN.10.9	I am the door; if any one enters by me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture. 
JHN.10.10	The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly. 
JHN.10.11	 I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. 
JHN.10.12	He who is a hireling and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. 
JHN.10.13	He flees because he is a hireling and cares nothing for the sheep. 
JHN.10.14	I am the good shepherd; I know my own and my own know me, 
JHN.10.15	 as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. 
JHN.10.16	 And I have other sheep, that are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will heed my voice. So there shall be one flock, one shepherd. 
JHN.10.17	For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again. 
JHN.10.18	 No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again; this charge I have received from my Father.”
JHN.10.20	 Many of them said, “He has a demon, and he is mad; why listen to him?” 
JHN.10.21	 Others said, “These are not the sayings of one who has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”
JHN.10.22	It was the feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem; 
JHN.10.23	 it was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the portico of Solomon. 
JHN.10.24	So the Jews gathered round him and said to him, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.” 
JHN.10.25	 Jesus answered them, “I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness to me; 
JHN.10.26	 but you do not believe, because you do not belong to my sheep. 
JHN.10.27	My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me; 
JHN.10.28	 and I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand. 
JHN.10.29	My Father, who has given them to me,
JHN.10.30	 I and the Father are one.”
JHN.10.32	Jesus answered them, “I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of these do you stone me?” 
JHN.10.33	 The Jews answered him, “It is not for a good work that we stone you but for blasphemy; because you, being a man, make yourself God.” 
JHN.10.34	 Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said, you are gods’? 
JHN.10.35	If he called them gods to whom the word of God came (and scripture cannot be broken), 
JHN.10.36	do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’? 
JHN.10.37	If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me; 
JHN.10.38	but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.” 
JHN.10.39	 Again they tried to arrest him, but he escaped from their hands.
JHN.10.41	And many came to him; and they said, “John did no sign, but everything that John said about this man was true.” 
JHN.10.42	 And many believed in him there.
JHN.11.2	 It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill. 
JHN.11.3	So the sisters sent to him, saying, “Lord, he whom you love is ill.” 
JHN.11.4	 But when Jesus heard it he said, “This illness is not unto death; it is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified by means of it.”
JHN.11.5	Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. 
JHN.11.6	So when he heard that he was ill, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was. 
JHN.11.7	Then after this he said to the disciples, “Let us go into Judea again.” 
JHN.11.8	 The disciples said to him, “Rabbi, the Jews were but now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?” 
JHN.11.9	 Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any one walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. 
JHN.11.10	But if any one walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.” 
JHN.11.11	 Thus he spoke, and then he said to them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awake him out of sleep.” 
JHN.11.12	The disciples said to him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.” 
JHN.11.13	Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep. 
JHN.11.14	Then Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead; 
JHN.11.15	and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.” 
JHN.11.16	 Thomas, called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with him.”
JHN.11.17	Now when Jesus came, he found that Lazarus
JHN.11.18	Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles
JHN.11.19	 and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother. 
JHN.11.20	When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, while Mary sat in the house. 
JHN.11.21	Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. 
JHN.11.22	And even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you.” 
JHN.11.23	Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.” 
JHN.11.24	 Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.” 
JHN.11.25	 Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life;
JHN.11.26	 and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?” 
JHN.11.27	 She said to him, “Yes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, he who is coming into the world.”
JHN.11.28	When she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary, saying quietly, “The Teacher is here and is calling for you.” 
JHN.11.29	And when she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him. 
JHN.11.30	Now Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him. 
JHN.11.31	When the Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary rise quickly and go out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there. 
JHN.11.32	 Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was and saw him, fell at his feet, saying to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.” 
JHN.11.33	When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled; 
JHN.11.34	and he said, “Where have you laid him?” They said to him, “Lord, come and see.” 
JHN.11.35	 Jesus wept. 
JHN.11.36	So the Jews said, “See how he loved him!” 
JHN.11.37	 But some of them said, “Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?”
JHN.11.39	Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, “Lord, by this time there will be an odor, for he has been dead four days.” 
JHN.11.40	Jesus said to her, “Did I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?” 
JHN.11.41	 So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, “Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. 
JHN.11.42	 I knew that thou hearest me always, but I have said this on account of the people standing by, that they may believe that thou didst send me.” 
JHN.11.43	When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out.” 
JHN.11.44	 The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with bandages, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, “Unbind him, and let him go.”
JHN.11.45	Many of the Jews therefore, who had come with Mary and had seen what he did, believed in him; 
JHN.11.46	but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. 
JHN.11.47	So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the council, and said, “What are we to do? For this man performs many signs. 
JHN.11.48	If we let him go on thus, every one will believe in him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our holy place
JHN.11.49	 But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all; 
JHN.11.50	you do not understand that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation should not perish.” 
JHN.11.51	He did not say this of his own accord, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation, 
JHN.11.52	 and not for the nation only, but to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad. 
JHN.11.53	So from that day on they took counsel how to put him to death.
JHN.11.54	Jesus therefore no longer went about openly among the Jews, but went from there to the country near the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim; and there he stayed with the disciples.
JHN.11.56	 They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, “What do you think? That he will not come to the feast?” 
JHN.11.57	Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if any one knew where he was, he should let them know, so that they might arrest him.
JHN.12.2	There they made him a supper; Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at table with him. 
JHN.12.3	Mary took a pound of costly ointment of pure nard and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment. 
JHN.12.4	 But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (he who was to betray him), said, 
JHN.12.5	“Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii
JHN.12.6	 This he said, not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief, and as he had the money box he used to take what was put into it. 
JHN.12.7	 Jesus said, “Let her alone, let her keep it for the day of my burial. 
JHN.12.8	The poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.”
JHN.12.9	When the great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, they came, not only on account of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. 
JHN.12.10	 So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus also to death, 
JHN.12.11	because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.
JHN.12.13	 So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!” 
JHN.12.14	And Jesus found a young ass and sat upon it; as it is written,
JHN.12.15	behold, your king is coming,
JHN.12.15	sitting on an ass's colt!”
JHN.12.17	The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead bore witness. 
JHN.12.18	The reason why the crowd went to meet him was that they heard he had done this sign. 
JHN.12.19	The Pharisees then said to one another, “You see that you can do nothing; look, the world has gone after him.”
JHN.12.21	 So these came to Philip, who was from Beth-saida in Galilee, and said to him, “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.” 
JHN.12.22	Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew went with Philip and they told Jesus. 
JHN.12.23	 And Jesus answered them, “The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified. 
JHN.12.24	 Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. 
JHN.12.25	 He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. 
JHN.12.26	If any one serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there shall my servant be also; if any one serves me, the Father will honor him.
JHN.12.28	 Father, glorify thy name.” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.” 
JHN.12.29	The crowd standing by heard it and said that it had thundered. Others said, “An angel has spoken to him.” 
JHN.12.30	Jesus answered, “This voice has come for your sake, not for mine. 
JHN.12.31	 Now is the judgment of this world, now shall the ruler of this world be cast out; 
JHN.12.32	 and I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.” 
JHN.12.33	He said this to show by what death he was to die. 
JHN.12.34	 The crowd answered him, “We have heard from the law that the Christ remains for ever. How can you say that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?” 
JHN.12.35	 Jesus said to them, “The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light, lest the darkness overtake you; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes. 
JHN.12.36	 While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light.”
JHN.12.36	When Jesus had said this, he departed and hid himself from them. 
JHN.12.37	Though he had done so many signs before them, yet they did not believe in him; 
JHN.12.38	 it was that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:
JHN.12.38	“Lord, who has believed our report,
JHN.12.38	and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”
JHN.12.39	Therefore they could not believe. For Isaiah again said,
JHN.12.40	lest they should see with their eyes and perceive with their heart,
JHN.12.40	and turn for me to heal them.”
JHN.12.42	 Nevertheless many even of the authorities believed in him, but for fear of the Pharisees they did not confess it, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: 
JHN.12.43	for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.
JHN.12.45	 And he who sees me sees him who sent me. 
JHN.12.46	 I have come as light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness. 
JHN.12.47	 If any one hears my sayings and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world. 
JHN.12.48	 He who rejects me and does not receive my sayings has a judge; the word that I have spoken will be his judge on the last day. 
JHN.12.49	For I have not spoken on my own authority; the Father who sent me has himself given me commandment what to say and what to speak. 
JHN.12.50	And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I say, therefore, I say as the Father has bidden me.”
JHN.13.2	 And during supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him, 
JHN.13.3	Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going to God, 
JHN.13.4	rose from supper, laid aside his garments, and girded himself with a towel. 
JHN.13.5	 Then he poured water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded. 
JHN.13.6	He came to Simon Peter; and Peter said to him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?” 
JHN.13.7	Jesus answered him, “What I am doing you do not know now, but afterward you will understand.” 
JHN.13.8	 Peter said to him, “You shall never wash my feet.” Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no part in me.” 
JHN.13.9	Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!” 
JHN.13.10	Jesus said to him, “He who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet,
JHN.13.11	 For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, “You are not all clean.”
JHN.13.12	When he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and resumed his place, he said to them, “Do you know what I have done to you? 
JHN.13.13	You call me Teacher and Lord; and you are right, for so I am. 
JHN.13.14	If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. 
JHN.13.15	 For I have given you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you. 
JHN.13.16	 Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant
JHN.13.17	 If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them. 
JHN.13.18	 I am not speaking of you all; I know whom I have chosen; it is that the scripture may be fulfilled, ‘He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me.’ 
JHN.13.19	 I tell you this now, before it takes place, that when it does take place you may believe that I am he. 
JHN.13.20	 Truly, truly, I say to you, he who receives any one whom I send receives me; and he who receives me receives him who sent me.”
JHN.13.22	The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke. 
JHN.13.23	 One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was lying close to the breast of Jesus; 
JHN.13.24	so Simon Peter beckoned to him and said, “Tell us who it is of whom he speaks.” 
JHN.13.25	So lying thus, close to the breast of Jesus, he said to him, “Lord, who is it?” 
JHN.13.26	 Jesus answered, “It is he to whom I shall give this morsel when I have dipped it.” So when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. 
JHN.13.27	Then after the morsel, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, “What you are going to do, do quickly.” 
JHN.13.28	Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him. 
JHN.13.29	 Some thought that, because Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling him, “Buy what we need for the feast”; or, that he should give something to the poor. 
JHN.13.30	 So, after receiving the morsel, he immediately went out; and it was night.
JHN.13.32	if God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once. 
JHN.13.33	 Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me; and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you, ‘Where I am going you cannot come.’ 
JHN.13.34	 A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; even as I have loved you, that you also love one another. 
JHN.13.35	By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”
JHN.13.37	 Peter said to him, “Lord, why cannot I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.” 
JHN.13.38	Jesus answered, “Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the cock will not crow, till you have denied me three times.
JHN.14.1	“Let not your hearts be troubled; believe
JHN.14.2	 In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? 
JHN.14.3	And when I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also. 
JHN.14.4	And you know the way where I am going.”
JHN.14.5	 Thomas said to him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going; how can we know the way?” 
JHN.14.6	 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me. 
JHN.14.7	If you had known me, you would have known my Father also; henceforth you know him and have seen him.”
JHN.14.8	Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and we shall be satisfied.” 
JHN.14.9	 Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you so long, and yet you do not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father; how can you say, ‘Show us the Father’? 
JHN.14.10	Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority; but the Father who dwells in me does his works. 
JHN.14.11	 Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me; or else believe me for the sake of the works themselves.
JHN.14.12	“Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I go to the Father. 
JHN.14.13	 Whatever you ask in my name, I will do it, that the Father may be glorified in the Son; 
JHN.14.14	if you ask
JHN.14.16	 And I will pray the Father, and he will give you another Counselor, to be with you for ever, 
JHN.14.17	even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him; you know him, for he dwells with you, and will be in you.
JHN.14.18	“I will not leave you desolate; I will come to you. 
JHN.14.19	 Yet a little while, and the world will see me no more, but you will see me; because I live, you will live also. 
JHN.14.20	In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. 
JHN.14.21	He who has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me; and he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.” 
JHN.14.22	 Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, “Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?” 
JHN.14.23	 Jesus answered him, “If a man loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him. 
JHN.14.24	He who does not love me does not keep my words; and the word which you hear is not mine but the Father's who sent me.
JHN.14.25	“These things I have spoken to you, while I am still with you. 
JHN.14.26	But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you. 
JHN.14.27	 Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid. 
JHN.14.28	You heard me say to you, ‘I go away, and I will come to you.’ If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I. 
JHN.14.29	 And now I have told you before it takes place, so that when it does take place, you may believe. 
JHN.14.30	 I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me; 
JHN.14.31	 but I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father. Rise, let us go hence.
JHN.15.2	Every branch of mine that bears no fruit, he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. 
JHN.15.3	 You are already made clean by the word which I have spoken to you. 
JHN.15.4	 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. 
JHN.15.5	I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. 
JHN.15.6	If a man does not abide in me, he is cast forth as a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and burned. 
JHN.15.7	 If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you. 
JHN.15.8	 By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be my disciples. 
JHN.15.9	As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you; abide in my love. 
JHN.15.10	 If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. 
JHN.15.11	These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.
JHN.15.13	 Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. 
JHN.15.14	 You are my friends if you do what I command you. 
JHN.15.15	No longer do I call you servants,
JHN.15.16	 You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide; so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. 
JHN.15.17	This I command you, to love one another.
JHN.15.19	If you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. 
JHN.15.20	 Remember the word that I said to you, ‘A servant
JHN.15.21	But all this they will do to you on my account, because they do not know him who sent me. 
JHN.15.22	 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. 
JHN.15.23	He who hates me hates my Father also. 
JHN.15.24	If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would not have sin; but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father. 
JHN.15.25	 It is to fulfil the word that is written in their law, ‘They hated me without a cause.’ 
JHN.15.26	 But when the Counselor comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness to me; 
JHN.15.27	 and you also are witnesses, because you have been with me from the beginning.
JHN.16.1	“I have said all this to you to keep you from falling away. 
JHN.16.2	 They will put you out of the synagogues; indeed, the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God. 
JHN.16.3	And they will do this because they have not known the Father, nor me. 
JHN.16.4	But I have said these things to you, that when their hour comes you may remember that I told you of them.
JHN.16.4	“I did not say these things to you from the beginning, because I was with you. 
JHN.16.5	 But now I am going to him who sent me; yet none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’ 
JHN.16.6	But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your hearts. 
JHN.16.7	 Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. 
JHN.16.8	And when he comes, he will convince
JHN.16.9	 concerning sin, because they do not believe in me; 
JHN.16.10	 concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no more; 
JHN.16.11	 concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.
JHN.16.12	“I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. 
JHN.16.13	When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. 
JHN.16.14	 He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you. 
JHN.16.15	All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.
JHN.16.17	Some of his disciples said to one another, “What is this that he says to us, ‘A little while, and you will not see me, and again a little while, and you will see me’; and, ‘because I go to the Father’?” 
JHN.16.18	They said, “What does he mean by ‘a little while’? We do not know what he means.” 
JHN.16.19	Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him; so he said to them, “Is this what you are asking yourselves, what I meant by saying, ‘A little while, and you will not see me, and again a little while, and you will see me’? 
JHN.16.20	 Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy. 
JHN.16.21	 When a woman is in travail she has sorrow, because her hour has come; but when she is delivered of the child, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a child
JHN.16.22	So you have sorrow now, but I will see you again and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you. 
JHN.16.23	In that day you will ask nothing of me. Truly, truly, I say to you, if you ask anything of the Father, he will give it to you in my name. 
JHN.16.24	 Hitherto you have asked nothing in my name; ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.
JHN.16.26	In that day you will ask in my name; and I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you; 
JHN.16.27	for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from the Father. 
JHN.16.28	I came from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving the world and going to the Father.”
JHN.16.29	His disciples said, “Ah, now you are speaking plainly, not in any figure! 
JHN.16.30	Now we know that you know all things, and need none to question you; by this we believe that you came from God.” 
JHN.16.31	Jesus answered them, “Do you now believe? 
JHN.16.32	 The hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be scattered, every man to his home, and will leave me alone; yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me. 
JHN.16.33	 I have said this to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.”
JHN.17.2	since thou hast given him power over all flesh, to give eternal life to all whom thou hast given him. 
JHN.17.3	And this is eternal life, that they know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent. 
JHN.17.4	I glorified thee on earth, having accomplished the work which thou gavest me to do; 
JHN.17.5	 and now, Father, glorify thou me in thy own presence with the glory which I had with thee before the world was made.
JHN.17.6	“I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world; thine they were, and thou gavest them to me, and they have kept thy word. 
JHN.17.7	Now they know that everything that thou hast given me is from thee; 
JHN.17.8	for I have given them the words which thou gavest me, and they have received them and know in truth that I came from thee; and they have believed that thou didst send me. 
JHN.17.9	 I am praying for them; I am not praying for the world but for those whom thou hast given me, for they are thine; 
JHN.17.10	all mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them. 
JHN.17.11	 And now I am no more in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name, which thou hast given me, that they may be one, even as we are one. 
JHN.17.12	 While I was with them, I kept them in thy name, which thou hast given me; I have guarded them, and none of them is lost but the son of perdition, that the scripture might be fulfilled. 
JHN.17.13	But now I am coming to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves. 
JHN.17.14	 I have given them thy word; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 
JHN.17.15	I do not pray that thou shouldst take them out of the world, but that thou shouldst keep them from the evil one.
JHN.17.16	They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 
JHN.17.17	Sanctify them in the truth; thy word is truth. 
JHN.17.18	As thou didst send me into the world, so I have sent them into the world. 
JHN.17.19	And for their sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be consecrated in truth.
JHN.17.20	“I do not pray for these only, but also for those who believe in me through their word, 
JHN.17.21	 that they may all be one; even as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. 
JHN.17.22	The glory which thou hast given me I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one, 
JHN.17.23	I in them and thou in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them even as thou hast loved me. 
JHN.17.24	 Father, I desire that they also, whom thou hast given me, may be with me where I am, to behold my glory which thou hast given me in thy love for me before the foundation of the world. 
JHN.17.25	O righteous Father, the world has not known thee, but I have known thee; and these know that thou hast sent me. 
JHN.17.26	I made known to them thy name, and I will make it known, that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.”
JHN.18.2	Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place; for Jesus often met there with his disciples. 
JHN.18.3	 So Judas, procuring a band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, went there with lanterns and torches and weapons. 
JHN.18.4	 Then Jesus, knowing all that was to befall him, came forward and said to them, “Whom do you seek?” 
JHN.18.5	They answered him, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Jesus said to them, “I am he.” Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them. 
JHN.18.6	When he said to them, “I am he,” they drew back and fell to the ground. 
JHN.18.7	Again he asked them, “Whom do you seek?” And they said, “Jesus of Nazareth.” 
JHN.18.8	Jesus answered, “I told you that I am he; so, if you seek me, let these men go.” 
JHN.18.9	 This was to fulfil the word which he had spoken, “Of those whom thou gavest me I lost not one.” 
JHN.18.10	Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's slave and cut off his right ear. The slave's name was Malchus. 
JHN.18.11	 Jesus said to Peter, “Put your sword into its sheath; shall I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?”
JHN.18.13	First they led him to Annas; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. 
JHN.18.14	 It was Caiaphas who had given counsel to the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
JHN.18.16	while Peter stood outside at the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the maid who kept the door, and brought Peter in. 
JHN.18.17	 The maid who kept the door said to Peter, “Are not you also one of this man's disciples?” He said, “I am not.” 
JHN.18.18	Now the servants
JHN.18.20	Jesus answered him, “I have spoken openly to the world; I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all Jews come together; I have said nothing secretly. 
JHN.18.21	Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me, what I said to them; they know what I said.” 
JHN.18.22	When he had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, “Is that how you answer the high priest?” 
JHN.18.23	 Jesus answered him, “If I have spoken wrongly, bear witness to the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?” 
JHN.18.24	 Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
JHN.18.26	One of the servants
JHN.18.27	Peter again denied it; and at once the cock crowed.
JHN.18.29	 So Pilate went out to them and said, “What accusation do you bring against this man?” 
JHN.18.30	They answered him, “If this man were not an evildoer, we would not have handed him over.” 
JHN.18.31	Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.” The Jews said to him, “It is not lawful for us to put any man to death.” 
JHN.18.32	 This was to fulfil the word which Jesus had spoken to show by what death he was to die.
JHN.18.33	Pilate entered the praetorium again and called Jesus, and said to him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” 
JHN.18.34	Jesus answered, “Do you say this of your own accord, or did others say it to you about me?” 
JHN.18.35	Pilate answered, “Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me; what have you done?” 
JHN.18.36	 Jesus answered, “My kingship is not of this world; if my kingship were of this world, my servants would fight, that I might not be handed over to the Jews; but my kingship is not from the world.” 
JHN.18.37	 Pilate said to him, “So you are a king?” Jesus answered, “You say that I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Every one who is of the truth hears my voice.” 
JHN.18.38	 Pilate said to him, “What is truth?”
JHN.18.38	After he had said this, he went out to the Jews again, and told them, “I find no crime in him. 
JHN.18.39	But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover; will you have me release for you the King of the Jews?” 
JHN.18.40	They cried out again, “Not this man, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a robber.
JHN.19.1	Then Pilate took Jesus and scourged him. 
JHN.19.2	 And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple robe; 
JHN.19.3	they came up to him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and struck him with their hands. 
JHN.19.4	 Pilate went out again, and said to them, “See, I am bringing him out to you, that you may know that I find no crime in him.” 
JHN.19.5	So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, “Behold the man!” 
JHN.19.6	When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, “Crucify him, crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no crime in him.” 
JHN.19.7	 The Jews answered him, “We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he has made himself the Son of God.” 
JHN.19.8	When Pilate heard these words, he was the more afraid; 
JHN.19.9	he entered the praetorium again and said to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave no answer. 
JHN.19.10	Pilate therefore said to him, “You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?” 
JHN.19.11	 Jesus answered him, “You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above; therefore he who delivered me to you has the greater sin.”
JHN.19.13	When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement, and in Hebrew, Gabbatha. 
JHN.19.14	 Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, “Behold your King!” 
JHN.19.15	They cried out, “Away with him, away with him, crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar.” 
JHN.19.16	Then he handed him over to them to be crucified.
JHN.19.18	There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them. 
JHN.19.19	Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the cross; it read, “Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.” 
JHN.19.20	Many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. 
JHN.19.21	The chief priests of the Jews then said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but, ‘This man said, I am King of the Jews.’ ” 
JHN.19.22	Pilate answered, “What I have written I have written.”
JHN.19.23	When the soldiers had crucified Jesus they took his garments and made four parts, one for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was without seam, woven from top to bottom; 
JHN.19.24	 so they said to one another, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be.” This was to fulfil the scripture,
JHN.19.24	“They parted my garments among them,
JHN.19.24	and for my clothing they cast lots.”
JHN.19.26	 When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing near, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!” 
JHN.19.27	Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.
JHN.19.29	A bowl full of vinegar stood there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth. 
JHN.19.30	When Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, “It is finished”; and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.
JHN.19.32	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him; 
JHN.19.33	but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. 
JHN.19.34	 But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water. 
JHN.19.35	 He who saw it has borne witness—his testimony is true, and he knows that he tells the truth—that you also may believe. 
JHN.19.36	 For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, “Not a bone of him shall be broken.” 
JHN.19.37	 And again another scripture says, “They shall look on him whom they have pierced.”
JHN.19.39	 Nicodemus also, who had at first come to him by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds' weight. 
JHN.19.40	 They took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews. 
JHN.19.41	Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb where no one had ever been laid. 
JHN.19.42	So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, as the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.
JHN.20.2	So she ran, and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.” 
JHN.20.3	 Peter then came out with the other disciple, and they went toward the tomb. 
JHN.20.4	They both ran, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first; 
JHN.20.5	and stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. 
JHN.20.6	Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb; he saw the linen cloths lying, 
JHN.20.7	and the napkin, which had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths but rolled up in a place by itself. 
JHN.20.8	Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; 
JHN.20.9	 for as yet they did not know the scripture, that he must rise from the dead. 
JHN.20.10	Then the disciples went back to their homes.
JHN.20.11	But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb; 
JHN.20.12	 and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet. 
JHN.20.13	 They said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.” 
JHN.20.14	 Saying this, she turned round and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus. 
JHN.20.15	Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom do you seek?” Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.” 
JHN.20.16	Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned and said to him in Hebrew, “Rab-boni!” (which means Teacher). 
JHN.20.17	 Jesus said to her, “Do not hold me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.” 
JHN.20.18	 Mary Magdalene went and said to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord”; and she told them that he had said these things to her.
JHN.20.20	When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. 
JHN.20.21	 Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.” 
JHN.20.22	 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit. 
JHN.20.23	 If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.”
JHN.20.25	So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord.” But he said to them, “Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and place my finger in the mark of the nails, and place my hand in his side, I will not believe.”
JHN.20.26	Eight days later, his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. The doors were shut, but Jesus came and stood among them, and said, “Peace be with you.” 
JHN.20.27	 Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side; do not be faithless, but believing.” 
JHN.20.28	Thomas answered him, “My Lord and my God!” 
JHN.20.29	 Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe.”
JHN.20.31	 but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.
JHN.21.1	After this Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberi-as; and he revealed himself in this way. 
JHN.21.2	 Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathana-el of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together. 
JHN.21.3	 Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing.” They said to him, “We will go with you.” They went out and got into the boat; but that night they caught nothing.
JHN.21.5	 Jesus said to them, “Children, have you any fish?” They answered him, “No.” 
JHN.21.6	He said to them, “Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in, for the quantity of fish. 
JHN.21.7	 That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his clothes, for he was stripped for work, and sprang into the sea. 
JHN.21.8	But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, but about a hundred yards
JHN.21.9	When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire there, with fish lying on it, and bread. 
JHN.21.10	Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.” 
JHN.21.11	So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three of them; and although there were so many, the net was not torn. 
JHN.21.12	Jesus said to them, “Come and have breakfast.” Now none of the disciples dared ask him, “Who are you?” They knew it was the Lord. 
JHN.21.13	Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and so with the fish. 
JHN.21.14	 This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.
JHN.21.16	 A second time he said to him, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Tend my sheep.” 
JHN.21.17	He said to him the third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, “Do you love me?” And he said to him, “Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep. 
JHN.21.18	Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you girded yourself and walked where you would; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go.” 
JHN.21.19	 (This he said to show by what death he was to glorify God.) And after this he said to him, “Follow me.”
JHN.21.21	When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, “Lord, what about this man?” 
JHN.21.22	 Jesus said to him, “If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you? Follow me!” 
JHN.21.23	The saying spread abroad among the brethren that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die, but, “If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?”
ACT.1.2	until the day when he was taken up, after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen. 
ACT.1.3	To them he presented himself alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days, and speaking of the kingdom of God. 
ACT.1.4	 And while staying
ACT.1.5	for John baptized with water, but before many days you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.”
ACT.1.6	So when they had come together, they asked him, “Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?” 
ACT.1.7	He said to them, “It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has fixed by his own authority. 
ACT.1.8	 But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the end of the earth.” 
ACT.1.9	 And when he had said this, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. 
ACT.1.10	And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes, 
ACT.1.11	and said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.”
ACT.1.12	Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath day's journey away; 
ACT.1.13	 and when they had entered, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James. 
ACT.1.14	All these with one accord devoted themselves to prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
ACT.1.15	In those days Peter stood up among the brethren (the company of persons was in all about a hundred and twenty), and said, 
ACT.1.16	 “Brethren, the scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David, concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus. 
ACT.1.17	For he was numbered among us, and was allotted his share in this ministry. 
ACT.1.18	(Now this man bought a field with the reward of his wickedness; and falling headlong
ACT.1.19	And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.) 
ACT.1.20	 For it is written in the book of Psalms,
ACT.1.20	‘Let his habitation become desolate,
ACT.1.20	and let there be no one to live in it’;
ACT.1.20	and
ACT.1.20	‘His office let another take.’
ACT.1.21	So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, 
ACT.1.22	beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us—one of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection.” 
ACT.1.23	And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. 
ACT.1.24	And they prayed and said, “Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show which one of these two thou hast chosen 
ACT.1.25	to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside, to go to his own place.” 
ACT.1.26	And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was enrolled with the eleven apostles.
ACT.2.1	When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place. 
ACT.2.2	And suddenly a sound came from heaven like the rush of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. 
ACT.2.3	And there appeared to them tongues as of fire, distributed and resting on each one of them. 
ACT.2.4	And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
ACT.2.5	Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven. 
ACT.2.6	And at this sound the multitude came together, and they were bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in his own language. 
ACT.2.7	And they were amazed and wondered, saying, “Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? 
ACT.2.8	And how is it that we hear, each of us in his own native language? 
ACT.2.9	Parthians and Medes and Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, 
ACT.2.10	Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, 
ACT.2.11	Cretans and Arabians, we hear them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God.” 
ACT.2.12	And all were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, “What does this mean?” 
ACT.2.13	But others mocking said, “They are filled with new wine.”
ACT.2.14	But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them, “Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words. 
ACT.2.15	For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day; 
ACT.2.16	but this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:
ACT.2.17	that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh,
ACT.2.17	and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
ACT.2.17	and your young men shall see visions,
ACT.2.17	and your old men shall dream dreams;
ACT.2.18	yea, and on my menservants and my maidservants in those days
ACT.2.18	I will pour out my Spirit; and they shall prophesy.
ACT.2.19	And I will show wonders in the heaven above
ACT.2.19	and signs on the earth beneath,
ACT.2.19	blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke;
ACT.2.20	the sun shall be turned into darkness
ACT.2.20	and the moon into blood,
ACT.2.20	before the day of the Lord comes,
ACT.2.20	the great and manifest day.
ACT.2.21	And it shall be that whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.’
ACT.2.22	“Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs which God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know— 
ACT.2.23	this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. 
ACT.2.24	But God raised him up, having loosed the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. 
ACT.2.25	 For David says concerning him,
ACT.2.25	‘I saw the Lord always before me,
ACT.2.25	for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken;
ACT.2.26	therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced;
ACT.2.26	moreover my flesh will dwell in hope.
ACT.2.27	For thou wilt not abandon my soul to Hades,
ACT.2.27	nor let thy Holy One see corruption.
ACT.2.28	Thou hast made known to me the ways of life;
ACT.2.28	thou wilt make me full of gladness with thy presence.’
ACT.2.29	“Brethren, I may say to you confidently of the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. 
ACT.2.30	 Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants upon his throne, 
ACT.2.31	 he foresaw and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. 
ACT.2.32	This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses. 
ACT.2.33	Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which you see and hear. 
ACT.2.34	 For David did not ascend into the heavens; but he himself says,
ACT.2.34	‘The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,
ACT.2.35	till I make thy enemies a stool for thy feet.’
ACT.2.36	Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.”
ACT.2.37	Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brethren, what shall we do?” 
ACT.2.38	And Peter said to them, “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 
ACT.2.39	 For the promise is to you and to your children and to all that are far off, every one whom the Lord our God calls to him.” 
ACT.2.40	And he testified with many other words and exhorted them, saying, “Save yourselves from this crooked generation.” 
ACT.2.41	So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls. 
ACT.2.42	And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.
ACT.2.43	And fear came upon every soul; and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles. 
ACT.2.44	 And all who believed were together and had all things in common; 
ACT.2.45	and they sold their possessions and goods and distributed them to all, as any had need. 
ACT.2.46	And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they partook of food with glad and generous hearts, 
ACT.2.47	praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.
ACT.3.1	Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour. 
ACT.3.2	And a man lame from birth was being carried, whom they laid daily at that gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask alms of those who entered the temple. 
ACT.3.3	Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked for alms. 
ACT.3.4	And Peter directed his gaze at him, with John, and said, “Look at us.” 
ACT.3.5	And he fixed his attention upon them, expecting to receive something from them. 
ACT.3.6	But Peter said, “I have no silver and gold, but I give you what I have; in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.” 
ACT.3.7	And he took him by the right hand and raised him up; and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong. 
ACT.3.8	And leaping up he stood and walked and entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God. 
ACT.3.9	And all the people saw him walking and praising God, 
ACT.3.10	and recognized him as the one who sat for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
ACT.3.11	While he clung to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the portico called Solomon's, astounded. 
ACT.3.12	And when Peter saw it he addressed the people, “Men of Israel, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we had made him walk? 
ACT.3.13	 The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified his servant
ACT.3.14	But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, 
ACT.3.15	and killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses. 
ACT.3.16	And his name, by faith in his name, has made this man strong whom you see and know; and the faith which is through Jesus
ACT.3.17	“And now, brethren, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers. 
ACT.3.18	But what God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he thus fulfilled. 
ACT.3.19	Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, 
ACT.3.20	and that he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus, 
ACT.3.21	whom heaven must receive until the time for establishing all that God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old. 
ACT.3.22	 Moses said, ‘The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet from your brethren as he raised me up. You shall listen to him in whatever he tells you. 
ACT.3.23	 And it shall be that every soul that does not listen to that prophet shall be destroyed from the people.’ 
ACT.3.24	And all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those who came afterwards, also proclaimed these days. 
ACT.3.25	 You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God gave to your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your posterity shall all the families of the earth be blessed.’ 
ACT.3.26	God, having raised up his servant,
ACT.4.1	And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them, 
ACT.4.2	annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. 
ACT.4.3	And they arrested them and put them in custody until the morrow, for it was already evening. 
ACT.4.4	But many of those who heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to about five thousand.
ACT.4.5	On the morrow their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem, 
ACT.4.6	with Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family. 
ACT.4.7	And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, “By what power or by what name did you do this?” 
ACT.4.8	Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, “Rulers of the people and elders, 
ACT.4.9	if we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a cripple, by what means this man has been healed, 
ACT.4.10	be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by him this man is standing before you well. 
ACT.4.11	 This is the stone which was rejected by you builders, but which has become the head of the corner. 
ACT.4.12	And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.”
ACT.4.13	Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated, common men, they wondered; and they recognized that they had been with Jesus. 
ACT.4.14	But seeing the man that had been healed standing beside them, they had nothing to say in opposition. 
ACT.4.15	But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred with one another, 
ACT.4.16	saying, “What shall we do with these men? For that a notable sign has been performed through them is manifest to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it. 
ACT.4.17	But in order that it may spread no further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to any one in this name.” 
ACT.4.18	So they called them and charged them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. 
ACT.4.19	But Peter and John answered them, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge; 
ACT.4.20	for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard.” 
ACT.4.21	And when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people; for all men praised God for what had happened. 
ACT.4.22	For the man on whom this sign of healing was performed was more than forty years old.
ACT.4.23	When they were released they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them. 
ACT.4.24	 And when they heard it, they lifted their voices together to God and said, “Sovereign Lord, who didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them, 
ACT.4.25	 who by the mouth of our father David, thy servant,
ACT.4.25	‘Why did the Gentiles rage,
ACT.4.25	and the peoples imagine vain things?
ACT.4.26	The kings of the earth set themselves in array,
ACT.4.26	and the rulers were gathered together,
ACT.4.26	against the Lord and against his Anointed’—
ACT.4.28	to do whatever thy hand and thy plan had predestined to take place. 
ACT.4.29	And now, Lord, look upon their threats, and grant to thy servants
ACT.4.30	while thou stretchest out thy hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of thy holy servant
ACT.4.31	And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness.
ACT.4.33	And with great power the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all. 
ACT.4.34	There was not a needy person among them, for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of what was sold 
ACT.4.35	and laid it at the apostles' feet; and distribution was made to each as any had need. 
ACT.4.36	Thus Joseph who was surnamed by the apostles Barnabas (which means, Son of encouragement), a Levite, a native of Cyprus, 
ACT.4.37	sold a field which belonged to him, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.
ACT.5.1	But a man named Ananias with his wife Sapphira sold a piece of property, 
ACT.5.2	and with his wife's knowledge he kept back some of the proceeds, and brought only a part and laid it at the apostles' feet. 
ACT.5.3	But Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back part of the proceeds of the land? 
ACT.5.4	While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? How is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.” 
ACT.5.5	When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and died. And great fear came upon all who heard of it. 
ACT.5.6	The young men rose and wrapped him up and carried him out and buried him.
ACT.5.7	After an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. 
ACT.5.8	And Peter said to her, “Tell me whether you sold the land for so much.” And she said, “Yes, for so much.” 
ACT.5.9	But Peter said to her, “How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Hark, the feet of those that have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.” 
ACT.5.10	Immediately she fell down at his feet and died. When the young men came in they found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. 
ACT.5.11	And great fear came upon the whole church, and upon all who heard of these things.
ACT.5.12	Now many signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the apostles. And they were all together in Solomon's Portico. 
ACT.5.13	None of the rest dared join them, but the people held them in high honor. 
ACT.5.14	And more than ever believers were added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women, 
ACT.5.15	so that they even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and pallets, that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some of them. 
ACT.5.16	The people also gathered from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all healed.
ACT.5.17	But the high priest rose up and all who were with him, that is, the party of the Sadducees, and filled with jealousy 
ACT.5.18	they arrested the apostles and put them in the common prison. 
ACT.5.19	But at night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out and said, 
ACT.5.20	“Go and stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this Life.” 
ACT.5.21	And when they heard this, they entered the temple at daybreak and taught.
ACT.5.21	Now the high priest came and those who were with him and called together the council and all the senate of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought. 
ACT.5.22	But when the officers came, they did not find them in the prison, and they returned and reported, 
ACT.5.23	“We found the prison securely locked and the sentries standing at the doors, but when we opened it we found no one inside.” 
ACT.5.24	Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were much perplexed about them, wondering what this would come to. 
ACT.5.25	And some one came and told them, “The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.” 
ACT.5.26	Then the captain with the officers went and brought them, but without violence, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people.
ACT.5.27	And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest questioned them, 
ACT.5.28	saying, “We strictly charged you not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and you intend to bring this man's blood upon us.” 
ACT.5.29	But Peter and the apostles answered, “We must obey God rather than men. 
ACT.5.30	 The God of our fathers raised Jesus whom you killed by hanging him on a tree. 
ACT.5.31	God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. 
ACT.5.32	And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him.”
ACT.5.33	When they heard this they were enraged and wanted to kill them. 
ACT.5.34	But a Pharisee in the council named Gamali-el, a teacher of the law, held in honor by all the people, stood up and ordered the men to be put outside for a while. 
ACT.5.35	And he said to them, “Men of Israel, take care what you do with these men. 
ACT.5.36	For before these days Theudas arose, giving himself out to be somebody, and a number of men, about four hundred, joined him; but he was slain and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing. 
ACT.5.37	After him Judas the Galilean arose in the days of the census and drew away some of the people after him; he also perished, and all who followed him were scattered. 
ACT.5.38	So in the present case I tell you, keep away from these men and let them alone; for if this plan or this undertaking is of men, it will fail; 
ACT.5.39	but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them. You might even be found opposing God!”
ACT.5.40	So they took his advice, and when they had called in the apostles, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. 
ACT.5.41	Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name. 
ACT.5.42	And every day in the temple and at home they did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ.
ACT.6.1	Now in these days when the disciples were increasing in number, the Hellenists murmured against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily distribution. 
ACT.6.2	And the twelve summoned the body of the disciples and said, “It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables. 
ACT.6.3	Therefore, brethren, pick out from among you seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint to this duty. 
ACT.6.4	But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.” 
ACT.6.5	And what they said pleased the whole multitude, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch. 
ACT.6.6	These they set before the apostles, and they prayed and laid their hands upon them.
ACT.6.7	And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were obedient to the faith.
ACT.6.8	And Stephen, full of grace and power, did great wonders and signs among the people. 
ACT.6.9	Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, arose and disputed with Stephen. 
ACT.6.10	But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke. 
ACT.6.11	Then they secretly instigated men, who said, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.” 
ACT.6.12	And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came upon him and seized him and brought him before the council, 
ACT.6.13	and set up false witnesses who said, “This man never ceases to speak words against this holy place and the law; 
ACT.6.14	for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.” 
ACT.6.15	And gazing at him, all who sat in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel.
ACT.7.1	And the high priest said, “Is this so?” 
ACT.7.2	 And Stephen said:
ACT.7.2	“Brethren and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, 
ACT.7.3	 and said to him, ‘Depart from your land and from your kindred and go into the land which I will show you.’ 
ACT.7.4	 Then he departed from the land of the Chaldeans, and lived in Haran. And after his father died, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living; 
ACT.7.5	 yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot's length, but promised to give it to him in possession and to his posterity after him, though he had no child. 
ACT.7.6	 And God spoke to this effect, that his posterity would be aliens in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and ill-treat them four hundred years. 
ACT.7.7	 ‘But I will judge the nation which they serve,’ said God, ‘and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place.’ 
ACT.7.8	 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.
ACT.7.10	 and rescued him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him governor over Egypt and over all his household. 
ACT.7.11	 Now there came a famine throughout all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction, and our fathers could find no food. 
ACT.7.12	 But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent forth our fathers the first time. 
ACT.7.13	 And at the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph's family became known to Pharaoh. 
ACT.7.15	and Jacob went down into Egypt. And he died, himself and our fathers, 
ACT.7.16	 and they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.
ACT.7.18	till there arose over Egypt another king who had not known Joseph. 
ACT.7.19	 He dealt craftily with our race and forced our fathers to expose their infants, that they might not be kept alive. 
ACT.7.20	 At this time Moses was born, and was beautiful before God. And he was brought up for three months in his father's house; 
ACT.7.21	 and when he was exposed, Pharaoh's daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son. 
ACT.7.22	And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in his words and deeds.
ACT.7.24	And seeing one of them being wronged, he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking the Egyptian. 
ACT.7.25	He supposed that his brethren understood that God was giving them deliverance by his hand, but they did not understand. 
ACT.7.26	And on the following day he appeared to them as they were quarreling and would have reconciled them, saying, ‘Men, you are brethren, why do you wrong each other?’ 
ACT.7.27	But the man who was wronging his neighbor thrust him aside, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge over us? 
ACT.7.28	Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’ 
ACT.7.29	 At this retort Moses fled, and became an exile in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.
ACT.7.31	When Moses saw it he wondered at the sight; and as he drew near to look, the voice of the Lord came, 
ACT.7.32	‘I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.’ And Moses trembled and did not dare to look. 
ACT.7.33	And the Lord said to him, ‘Take off the shoes from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground. 
ACT.7.34	I have surely seen the ill-treatment of my people that are in Egypt and heard their groaning, and I have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you to Egypt.’
ACT.7.36	 He led them out, having performed wonders and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years. 
ACT.7.37	 This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, ‘God will raise up for you a prophet from your brethren as he raised me up.’ 
ACT.7.38	 This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our fathers; and he received living oracles to give to us. 
ACT.7.39	 Our fathers refused to obey him, but thrust him aside, and in their hearts they turned to Egypt, 
ACT.7.40	 saying to Aaron, ‘Make for us gods to go before us; as for this Moses who led us out from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.’ 
ACT.7.41	 And they made a calf in those days, and offered a sacrifice to the idol and rejoiced in the works of their hands. 
ACT.7.42	‘Did you offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices,
ACT.7.42	forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
ACT.7.43	And you took up the tent of Moloch,
ACT.7.43	and the star of the god Rephan,
ACT.7.43	the figures which you made to worship;
ACT.7.43	and I will remove you beyond Babylon.’
ACT.7.45	 Our fathers in turn brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations which God thrust out before our fathers. So it was until the days of David, 
ACT.7.46	 who found favor in the sight of God and asked leave to find a habitation for the God of Jacob. 
ACT.7.47	 But it was Solomon who built a house for him. 
ACT.7.48	Yet the Most High does not dwell in houses made with hands; as the prophet says,
ACT.7.49	and earth my footstool.
ACT.7.49	What house will you build for me, says the Lord,
ACT.7.49	or what is the place of my rest?
ACT.7.50	Did not my hand make all these things?’
ACT.7.52	Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered, 
ACT.7.53	you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep it.”
ACT.7.54	Now when they heard these things they were enraged, and they ground their teeth against him. 
ACT.7.55	But he, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God; 
ACT.7.56	and he said, “Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God.” 
ACT.7.57	But they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and rushed together upon him. 
ACT.7.58	Then they cast him out of the city and stoned him; and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul. 
ACT.7.59	And as they were stoning Stephen, he prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” 
ACT.7.60	And he knelt down and cried with a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
ACT.8.1	And on that day a great persecution arose against the church in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered throughout the region of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. 
ACT.8.2	Devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him. 
ACT.8.3	But Saul was ravaging the church, and entering house after house, he dragged off men and women and committed them to prison.
ACT.8.4	Now those who were scattered went about preaching the word. 
ACT.8.5	Philip went down to a city of Samaria, and proclaimed to them the Christ. 
ACT.8.6	And the multitudes with one accord gave heed to what was said by Philip, when they heard him and saw the signs which he did. 
ACT.8.7	For unclean spirits came out of many who were possessed, crying with a loud voice; and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed. 
ACT.8.8	So there was much joy in that city.
ACT.8.9	But there was a man named Simon who had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the nation of Samaria, saying that he himself was somebody great. 
ACT.8.10	They all gave heed to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, “This man is that power of God which is called Great.” 
ACT.8.11	And they gave heed to him, because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic. 
ACT.8.12	But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. 
ACT.8.13	Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized he continued with Philip. And seeing signs and great miracles performed, he was amazed.
ACT.8.14	Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John, 
ACT.8.15	who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit; 
ACT.8.16	for it had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
ACT.8.17	Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit. 
ACT.8.18	Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money, 
ACT.8.19	saying, “Give me also this power, that any one on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.” 
ACT.8.20	But Peter said to him, “Your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money! 
ACT.8.21	 You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God. 
ACT.8.22	Repent therefore of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you. 
ACT.8.23	 For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.” 
ACT.8.24	And Simon answered, “Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may come upon me.”
ACT.8.25	Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.
ACT.8.26	But an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Rise and go toward the south
ACT.8.27	And he rose and went. And behold, an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a minister of the Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, in charge of all her treasure, had come to Jerusalem to worship 
ACT.8.28	and was returning; seated in his chariot, he was reading the prophet Isaiah. 
ACT.8.29	And the Spirit said to Philip, “Go up and join this chariot.” 
ACT.8.30	So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and asked, “Do you understand what you are reading?” 
ACT.8.31	And he said, “How can I, unless some one guides me?” And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. 
ACT.8.32	 Now the passage of the scripture which he was reading was this:
ACT.8.32	“As a sheep led to the slaughter
ACT.8.32	or a lamb before its shearer is dumb,
ACT.8.32	so he opens not his mouth.
ACT.8.33	In his humiliation justice was denied him.
ACT.8.33	Who can describe his generation?
ACT.8.33	For his life is taken up from the earth.”
ACT.8.34	And the eunuch said to Philip, “About whom, pray, does the prophet say this, about himself or about some one else?” 
ACT.8.35	Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this scripture he told him the good news of Jesus. 
ACT.8.36	And as they went along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said, “See, here is water! What is to prevent my being baptized?” 
ACT.8.38	And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him. 
ACT.8.39	And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught up Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing. 
ACT.8.40	But Philip was found at Azotus, and passing on he preached the gospel to all the towns till he came to Caesarea.
ACT.9.2	and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. 
ACT.9.3	Now as he journeyed he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed about him. 
ACT.9.4	And he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?” 
ACT.9.5	And he said, “Who are you, Lord?” And he said, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting; 
ACT.9.6	but rise and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do.” 
ACT.9.7	The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one. 
ACT.9.8	Saul arose from the ground; and when his eyes were opened, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. 
ACT.9.9	And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.
ACT.9.10	Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, “Ananias.” And he said, “Here I am, Lord.” 
ACT.9.11	And the Lord said to him, “Rise and go to the street called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for a man of Tarsus named Saul; for behold, he is praying, 
ACT.9.12	and he has seen a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.” 
ACT.9.13	But Ananias answered, “Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to thy saints at Jerusalem; 
ACT.9.14	and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call upon thy name.” 
ACT.9.15	But the Lord said to him, “Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel; 
ACT.9.16	for I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.” 
ACT.9.17	So Ananias departed and entered the house. And laying his hands on him he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.” 
ACT.9.18	And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and he regained his sight. Then he rose and was baptized, 
ACT.9.19	and took food and was strengthened.
ACT.9.19	For several days he was with the disciples at Damascus. 
ACT.9.20	And in the synagogues immediately he proclaimed Jesus, saying, “He is the Son of God.” 
ACT.9.21	And all who heard him were amazed, and said, “Is not this the man who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called on this name? And he has come here for this purpose, to bring them bound before the chief priests.” 
ACT.9.22	But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Christ.
ACT.9.23	When many days had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him, 
ACT.9.24	 but their plot became known to Saul. They were watching the gates day and night, to kill him; 
ACT.9.25	but his disciples took him by night and let him down over the wall, lowering him in a basket.
ACT.9.26	And when he had come to Jerusalem he attempted to join the disciples; and they were all afraid of him, for they did not believe that he was a disciple. 
ACT.9.27	But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how on the road he had seen the Lord, who spoke to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus. 
ACT.9.28	So he went in and out among them at Jerusalem, 
ACT.9.29	preaching boldly in the name of the Lord. And he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists; but they were seeking to kill him. 
ACT.9.30	And when the brethren knew it, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him off to Tarsus.
ACT.9.31	So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was built up; and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit it was multiplied.
ACT.9.32	Now as Peter went here and there among them all, he came down also to the saints that lived at Lydda. 
ACT.9.33	There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years and was paralyzed. 
ACT.9.34	And Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; rise and make your bed.” And immediately he rose. 
ACT.9.35	And all the residents of Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.
ACT.9.36	Now there was at Joppa a disciple named Tabitha, which means Dorcas.
ACT.9.37	In those days she fell sick and died; and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room. 
ACT.9.38	Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him entreating him, “Please come to us without delay.” 
ACT.9.39	So Peter rose and went with them. And when he had come, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him weeping, and showing tunics and other garments which Dorcas made while she was with them. 
ACT.9.40	But Peter put them all outside and knelt down and prayed; then turning to the body he said, “Tabitha, rise.” And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up. 
ACT.9.41	And he gave her his hand and lifted her up. Then calling the saints and widows he presented her alive. 
ACT.9.42	And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. 
ACT.9.43	And he stayed in Joppa for many days with one Simon, a tanner.
ACT.10.2	a devout man who feared God with all his household, gave alms liberally to the people, and prayed constantly to God. 
ACT.10.3	About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming in and saying to him, “Cornelius.” 
ACT.10.4	And he stared at him in terror, and said, “What is it, Lord?” And he said to him, “Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God. 
ACT.10.5	And now send men to Joppa, and bring one Simon who is called Peter; 
ACT.10.6	he is lodging with Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside.” 
ACT.10.7	When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those that waited on him, 
ACT.10.8	and having related everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.
ACT.10.9	The next day, as they were on their journey and coming near the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour. 
ACT.10.10	And he became hungry and desired something to eat; but while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance 
ACT.10.11	and saw the heaven opened, and something descending, like a great sheet, let down by four corners upon the earth. 
ACT.10.12	In it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air. 
ACT.10.13	And there came a voice to him, “Rise, Peter; kill and eat.” 
ACT.10.14	But Peter said, “No, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.” 
ACT.10.15	And the voice came to him again a second time, “What God has cleansed, you must not call common.” 
ACT.10.16	This happened three times, and the thing was taken up at once to heaven.
ACT.10.17	Now while Peter was inwardly perplexed as to what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men that were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, stood before the gate 
ACT.10.18	and called out to ask whether Simon who was called Peter was lodging there. 
ACT.10.19	And while Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Behold, three men are looking for you. 
ACT.10.20	Rise and go down, and accompany them without hesitation; for I have sent them.” 
ACT.10.21	And Peter went down to the men and said, “I am the one you are looking for; what is the reason for your coming?” 
ACT.10.22	And they said, “Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house, and to hear what you have to say.” 
ACT.10.23	So he called them in to be his guests.
ACT.10.23	The next day he rose and went off with them, and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him. 
ACT.10.24	And on the following day they entered Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his kinsmen and close friends. 
ACT.10.25	When Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him. 
ACT.10.26	But Peter lifted him up, saying, “Stand up; I too am a man.” 
ACT.10.27	And as he talked with him, he went in and found many persons gathered; 
ACT.10.28	and he said to them, “You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit any one of another nation; but God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean. 
ACT.10.29	So when I was sent for, I came without objection. I ask then why you sent for me.”
ACT.10.30	And Cornelius said, “Four days ago, about this hour, I was keeping the ninth hour of prayer in my house; and behold, a man stood before me in bright apparel, 
ACT.10.31	saying, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God. 
ACT.10.32	Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter; he is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the seaside.’ 
ACT.10.33	So I sent to you at once, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God, to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord.”
ACT.10.34	And Peter opened his mouth and said: “Truly I perceive that God shows no partiality, 
ACT.10.35	but in every nation any one who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. 
ACT.10.36	You know the word which he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace by Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all), 
ACT.10.37	the word which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John preached: 
ACT.10.38	how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. 
ACT.10.39	And we are witnesses to all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree; 
ACT.10.40	but God raised him on the third day and made him manifest; 
ACT.10.41	not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. 
ACT.10.42	And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that he is the one ordained by God to be judge of the living and the dead. 
ACT.10.43	To him all the prophets bear witness that every one who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”
ACT.10.44	While Peter was still saying this, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word. 
ACT.10.45	And the believers from among the circumcised who came with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. 
ACT.10.46	For they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter declared, 
ACT.10.47	“Can any one forbid water for baptizing these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?” 
ACT.10.48	And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days.
ACT.11.1	Now the apostles and the brethren who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. 
ACT.11.2	So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcision party criticized him, 
ACT.11.3	saying, “Why did you go to uncircumcised men and eat with them?” 
ACT.11.4	 But Peter began and explained to them in order: 
ACT.11.5	“I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, something descending, like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came down to me. 
ACT.11.6	Looking at it closely I observed animals and beasts of prey and reptiles and birds of the air. 
ACT.11.7	And I heard a voice saying to me, ‘Rise, Peter; kill and eat.’ 
ACT.11.8	But I said, ‘No, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’ 
ACT.11.9	But the voice answered a second time from heaven, ‘What God has cleansed you must not call common.’ 
ACT.11.10	This happened three times, and all was drawn up again into heaven. 
ACT.11.11	At that very moment three men arrived at the house in which we were, sent to me from Caesarea. 
ACT.11.12	And the Spirit told me to go with them, making no distinction. These six brethren also accompanied me, and we entered the man's house. 
ACT.11.13	And he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send to Joppa and bring Simon called Peter; 
ACT.11.14	he will declare to you a message by which you will be saved, you and all your household.’ 
ACT.11.15	As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning. 
ACT.11.16	 And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, ‘John baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’ 
ACT.11.17	If then God gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could withstand God?” 
ACT.11.18	When they heard this they were silenced. And they glorified God, saying, “Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance unto life.”
ACT.11.20	But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Greeks
ACT.11.21	And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number that believed turned to the Lord. 
ACT.11.22	News of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. 
ACT.11.23	When he came and saw the grace of God, he was glad; and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose; 
ACT.11.24	for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a large company was added to the Lord. 
ACT.11.25	So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul; 
ACT.11.26	and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with
ACT.11.27	Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 
ACT.11.28	And one of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine over all the world; and this took place in the days of Claudius. 
ACT.11.29	And the disciples determined, every one according to his ability, to send relief to the brethren who lived in Judea; 
ACT.11.30	and they did so, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.
ACT.12.1	About that time Herod the king laid violent hands upon some who belonged to the church. 
ACT.12.2	He killed James the brother of John with the sword; 
ACT.12.3	and when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread. 
ACT.12.4	And when he had seized him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people. 
ACT.12.5	So Peter was kept in prison; but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church.
ACT.12.6	The very night when Herod was about to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison; 
ACT.12.7	and behold, an angel of the Lord appeared, and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, “Get up quickly.” And the chains fell off his hands. 
ACT.12.8	And the angel said to him, “Dress yourself and put on your sandals.” And he did so. And he said to him, “Wrap your mantle around you and follow me.” 
ACT.12.9	And he went out and followed him; he did not know that what was done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision. 
ACT.12.10	When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened to them of its own accord, and they went out and passed on through one street; and immediately the angel left him. 
ACT.12.11	And Peter came to himself, and said, “Now I am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.”
ACT.12.12	When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying. 
ACT.12.13	And when he knocked at the door of the gateway, a maid named Rhoda came to answer. 
ACT.12.14	Recognizing Peter's voice, in her joy she did not open the gate but ran in and told that Peter was standing at the gate. 
ACT.12.15	They said to her, “You are mad.” But she insisted that it was so. They said, “It is his angel!” 
ACT.12.16	But Peter continued knocking; and when they opened, they saw him and were amazed. 
ACT.12.17	But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, “Tell this to James and to the brethren.” Then he departed and went to another place.
ACT.12.18	Now when day came, there was no small stir among the soldiers over what had become of Peter. 
ACT.12.19	And when Herod had sought for him and could not find him, he examined the sentries and ordered that they should be put to death. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea, and remained there.
ACT.12.20	Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon; and they came to him in a body, and having persuaded Blastus, the king's chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king's country for food. 
ACT.12.21	On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes, took his seat upon the throne, and made an oration to them. 
ACT.12.22	And the people shouted, “The voice of a god, and not of man!” 
ACT.12.23	Immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he did not give God the glory; and he was eaten by worms and died.
ACT.12.24	But the word of God grew and multiplied.
ACT.12.25	And Barnabas and Saul returned from
ACT.13.1	Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers, Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Mana-en a member of the court of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. 
ACT.13.2	While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” 
ACT.13.3	Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off.
ACT.13.4	So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia; and from there they sailed to Cyprus. 
ACT.13.5	When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John to assist them. 
ACT.13.6	When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came upon a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet, named Bar-Jesus. 
ACT.13.7	He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence, who summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God. 
ACT.13.8	But Elymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name) withstood them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith. 
ACT.13.9	But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him 
ACT.13.10	 and said, “You son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, full of all deceit and villainy, will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord? 
ACT.13.11	And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind and unable to see the sun for a time.” Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand. 
ACT.13.12	Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had occurred, for he was astonished at the teaching of the Lord.
ACT.13.13	Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia. And John left them and returned to Jerusalem; 
ACT.13.14	but they passed on from Perga and came to Antioch of Pisidia. And on the sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down. 
ACT.13.15	After the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, “Brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it.” 
ACT.13.16	So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said:
ACT.13.16	“Men of Israel, and you that fear God, listen. 
ACT.13.17	 The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it. 
ACT.13.18	 And for about forty years he bore with
ACT.13.19	 And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years. 
ACT.13.20	And after that he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. 
ACT.13.21	Then they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. 
ACT.13.22	 And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king; of whom he testified and said, ‘I have found in David the son of Jesse a man after my heart, who will do all my will.’ 
ACT.13.23	Of this man's posterity God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised. 
ACT.13.24	 Before his coming John had preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. 
ACT.13.25	 And as John was finishing his course, he said, ‘What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.’
ACT.13.27	For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize him nor understand the utterances of the prophets which are read every sabbath, fulfilled these by condemning him. 
ACT.13.28	Though they could charge him with nothing deserving death, yet they asked Pilate to have him killed. 
ACT.13.29	And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb. 
ACT.13.30	But God raised him from the dead; 
ACT.13.31	and for many days he appeared to those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people. 
ACT.13.32	And we bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers, 
ACT.13.33	 this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus; as also it is written in the second psalm,
ACT.13.33	‘Thou art my Son,
ACT.13.33	today I have begotten thee.’
ACT.13.34	‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.’
ACT.13.35	‘Thou wilt not let thy Holy One see corruption.’
ACT.13.36	For David, after he had served the counsel of God in his own generation, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers, and saw corruption; 
ACT.13.37	but he whom God raised up saw no corruption. 
ACT.13.38	Let it be known to you therefore, brethren, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, 
ACT.13.39	and by him every one that believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses. 
ACT.13.40	Beware, therefore, lest there come upon you what is said in the prophets:
ACT.13.41	for I do a deed in your days,
ACT.13.41	a deed you will never believe, if one declares it to you.’ ”
ACT.13.42	As they went out, the people begged that these things might be told them the next sabbath. 
ACT.13.43	And when the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.
ACT.13.44	The next sabbath almost the whole city gathered together to hear the word of God. 
ACT.13.45	But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted what was spoken by Paul, and reviled him. 
ACT.13.46	And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, “It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken first to you. Since you thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles. 
ACT.13.47	 For so the Lord has commanded us, saying,
ACT.13.47	‘I have set you to be a light for the Gentiles,
ACT.13.47	that you may bring salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth.’ ”
ACT.13.48	And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and glorified the word of God; and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed. 
ACT.13.49	And the word of the Lord spread throughout all the region. 
ACT.13.50	But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, and stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district. 
ACT.13.51	But they shook off the dust from their feet against them, and went to Iconium. 
ACT.13.52	And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
ACT.14.1	Now at Iconium they entered together into the Jewish synagogue, and so spoke that a great company believed, both of Jews and of Greeks. 
ACT.14.2	But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brethren. 
ACT.14.3	So they remained for a long time, speaking boldly for the Lord, who bore witness to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands. 
ACT.14.4	But the people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews, and some with the apostles. 
ACT.14.5	When an attempt was made by both Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to molest them and to stone them, 
ACT.14.6	they learned of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding country; 
ACT.14.7	and there they preached the gospel.
ACT.14.8	Now at Lystra there was a man sitting, who could not use his feet; he was a cripple from birth, who had never walked. 
ACT.14.9	He listened to Paul speaking; and Paul, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well, 
ACT.14.10	said in a loud voice, “Stand upright on your feet.” And he sprang up and walked. 
ACT.14.11	And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in Lycaonian, “The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!” 
ACT.14.12	Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, because he was the chief speaker, they called Hermes. 
ACT.14.13	And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifice with the people. 
ACT.14.14	But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their garments and rushed out among the multitude, crying, 
ACT.14.15	 “Men, why are you doing this? We also are men, of like nature with you, and bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them. 
ACT.14.16	In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways; 
ACT.14.17	yet he did not leave himself without witness, for he did good and gave you from heaven rains and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.” 
ACT.14.18	With these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them.
ACT.14.20	But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and entered the city; and on the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe. 
ACT.14.21	When they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch, 
ACT.14.22	strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God. 
ACT.14.23	And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting, they committed them to the Lord in whom they believed.
ACT.14.24	Then they passed through Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia. 
ACT.14.25	And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia; 
ACT.14.26	and from there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled. 
ACT.14.27	And when they arrived, they gathered the church together and declared all that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles. 
ACT.14.28	And they remained no little time with the disciples.
ACT.15.2	And when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them, Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and the elders about this question. 
ACT.15.3	So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, reporting the conversion of the Gentiles, and they gave great joy to all the brethren. 
ACT.15.4	When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they declared all that God had done with them. 
ACT.15.5	But some believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees rose up, and said, “It is necessary to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the law of Moses.”
ACT.15.6	The apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter. 
ACT.15.7	And after there had been much debate, Peter rose and said to them, “Brethren, you know that in the early days God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe. 
ACT.15.8	And God who knows the heart bore witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us; 
ACT.15.9	and he made no distinction between us and them, but cleansed their hearts by faith. 
ACT.15.10	Now therefore why do you make trial of God by putting a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear? 
ACT.15.11	But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will.”
ACT.15.12	And all the assembly kept silence; and they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles. 
ACT.15.13	After they finished speaking, James replied, “Brethren, listen to me. 
ACT.15.14	Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. 
ACT.15.15	And with this the words of the prophets agree, as it is written,
ACT.15.16	and I will rebuild the dwelling of David, which has fallen;
ACT.15.16	I will rebuild its ruins,
ACT.15.16	and I will set it up,
ACT.15.17	that the rest of men may seek the Lord,
ACT.15.17	and all the Gentiles who are called by my name,
ACT.15.18	says the Lord, who has made these things known from of old.’
ACT.15.19	Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God, 
ACT.15.20	but should write to them to abstain from the pollutions of idols and from unchastity and from what is strangled
ACT.15.21	For from early generations Moses has had in every city those who preach him, for he is read every sabbath in the synagogues.”
ACT.15.22	Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They sent Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren, 
ACT.15.23	with the following letter: “The brethren, both the apostles and the elders, to the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting. 
ACT.15.24	Since we have heard that some persons from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your minds, although we gave them no instructions, 
ACT.15.25	it has seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, 
ACT.15.26	men who have risked their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
ACT.15.27	We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth. 
ACT.15.28	For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things: 
ACT.15.29	that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled
ACT.15.30	So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch; and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter. 
ACT.15.31	And when they read it, they rejoiced at the exhortation. 
ACT.15.32	And Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, exhorted the brethren with many words and strengthened them. 
ACT.15.33	And after they had spent some time, they were sent off in peace by the brethren to those who had sent them. 
ACT.15.35	But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.
ACT.15.36	And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, “Come, let us return and visit the brethren in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are.” 
ACT.15.37	And Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark. 
ACT.15.38	But Paul thought best not to take with them one who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia, and had not gone with them to the work. 
ACT.15.39	And there arose a sharp contention, so that they separated from each other; Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus, 
ACT.15.40	but Paul chose Silas and departed, being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord. 
ACT.15.41	And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
ACT.16.1	And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra. A disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer; but his father was a Greek. 
ACT.16.2	He was well spoken of by the brethren at Lystra and Iconium. 
ACT.16.3	Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek. 
ACT.16.4	As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to them for observance the decisions which had been reached by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem. 
ACT.16.5	So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and they increased in numbers daily.
ACT.16.6	And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia. 
ACT.16.7	And when they had come opposite Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them; 
ACT.16.8	so, passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas. 
ACT.16.9	And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing beseeching him and saying, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.” 
ACT.16.10	And when he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go on into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
ACT.16.11	Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a direct voyage to Samothrace, and the following day to Ne-apolis, 
ACT.16.12	and from there to Philippi, which is the leading city of the district
ACT.16.13	and on the sabbath day we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together. 
ACT.16.14	One who heard us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple goods, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to give heed to what was said by Paul. 
ACT.16.15	And when she was baptized, with her household, she besought us, saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay.” And she prevailed upon us.
ACT.16.16	As we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners much gain by soothsaying. 
ACT.16.17	She followed Paul and us, crying, “These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation.” 
ACT.16.18	And this she did for many days. But Paul was annoyed, and turned and said to the spirit, “I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.” And it came out that very hour.
ACT.16.19	But when her owners saw that their hope of gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the market place before the rulers; 
ACT.16.20	and when they had brought them to the magistrates they said, “These men are Jews and they are disturbing our city. 
ACT.16.21	They advocate customs which it is not lawful for us Romans to accept or practice.” 
ACT.16.22	 The crowd joined in attacking them; and the magistrates tore the garments off them and gave orders to beat them with rods. 
ACT.16.23	And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely. 
ACT.16.24	Having received this charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.
ACT.16.25	But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them, 
ACT.16.26	and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and every one's fetters were unfastened. 
ACT.16.27	When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped. 
ACT.16.28	But Paul cried with a loud voice, “Do not harm yourself, for we are all here.” 
ACT.16.29	And he called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas, 
ACT.16.30	and brought them out and said, “Men, what must I do to be saved?” 
ACT.16.31	And they said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.” 
ACT.16.32	And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all that were in his house. 
ACT.16.33	And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their wounds, and he was baptized at once, with all his family. 
ACT.16.34	Then he brought them up into his house, and set food before them; and he rejoiced with all his household that he had believed in God.
ACT.16.35	But when it was day, the magistrates sent the police, saying, “Let those men go.” 
ACT.16.36	And the jailer reported the words to Paul, saying, “The magistrates have sent to let you go; now therefore come out and go in peace.” 
ACT.16.37	But Paul said to them, “They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now cast us out secretly? No! let them come themselves and take us out.” 
ACT.16.38	The police reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens; 
ACT.16.39	so they came and apologized to them. And they took them out and asked them to leave the city. 
ACT.16.40	So they went out of the prison, and visited Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they exhorted them and departed.
ACT.17.1	Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews. 
ACT.17.2	And Paul went in, as was his custom, and for three weeks
ACT.17.3	explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, and saying, “This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ.” 
ACT.17.4	And some of them were persuaded, and joined Paul and Silas; as did a great many of the devout Greeks and not a few of the leading women. 
ACT.17.5	But the Jews were jealous, and taking some wicked fellows of the rabble, they gathered a crowd, set the city in an uproar, and attacked the house of Jason, seeking to bring them out to the people. 
ACT.17.6	And when they could not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brethren before the city authorities, crying, “These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also, 
ACT.17.7	and Jason has received them; and they are all acting against the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.” 
ACT.17.8	And the people and the city authorities were disturbed when they heard this. 
ACT.17.9	And when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.
ACT.17.10	The brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea; and when they arrived they went into the Jewish synagogue. 
ACT.17.11	Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all eagerness, examining the scriptures daily to see if these things were so. 
ACT.17.12	Many of them therefore believed, with not a few Greek women of high standing as well as men. 
ACT.17.13	But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Beroea also, they came there too, stirring up and inciting the crowds. 
ACT.17.14	Then the brethren immediately sent Paul off on his way to the sea, but Silas and Timothy remained there. 
ACT.17.15	Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they departed.
ACT.17.16	Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols. 
ACT.17.17	So he argued in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the market place every day with those who chanced to be there. 
ACT.17.18	Some also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers met him. And some said, “What would this babbler say?” Others said, “He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities”—because he preached Jesus and the resurrection. 
ACT.17.19	And they took hold of him and brought him to the Are-opagus, saying, “May we know what this new teaching is which you present? 
ACT.17.20	For you bring some strange things to our ears; we wish to know therefore what these things mean.” 
ACT.17.21	Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new.
ACT.17.22	So Paul, standing in the middle of the Are-opagus, said: “Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious. 
ACT.17.23	For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, ‘To an unknown god.’ What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you. 
ACT.17.24	 The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in shrines made by man, 
ACT.17.25	nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all men life and breath and everything. 
ACT.17.26	And he made from one every nation of men to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their habitation, 
ACT.17.27	that they should seek God, in the hope that they might feel after him and find him. Yet he is not far from each one of us, 
ACT.17.28	 for
ACT.17.28	‘In him we live and move and have our being’;
ACT.17.28	as even some of your poets have said,
ACT.17.28	‘For we are indeed his offspring.’
ACT.17.29	Being then God's offspring, we ought not to think that the Deity is like gold, or silver, or stone, a representation by the art and imagination of man. 
ACT.17.30	The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all men everywhere to repent, 
ACT.17.31	 because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and of this he has given assurance to all men by raising him from the dead.”
ACT.17.32	Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, “We will hear you again about this.” 
ACT.17.33	So Paul went out from among them. 
ACT.17.34	But some men joined him and believed, among them Dionysius the Are-opagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them.
ACT.18.1	After this he left Athens and went to Corinth. 
ACT.18.2	And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, lately come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. And he went to see them; 
ACT.18.3	and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them, and they worked, for by trade they were tentmakers. 
ACT.18.4	And he argued in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.
ACT.18.5	When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul was occupied with preaching, testifying to the Jews that the Christ was Jesus. 
ACT.18.6	And when they opposed and reviled him, he shook out his garments and said to them, “Your blood be upon your heads! I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.” 
ACT.18.7	And he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius
ACT.18.8	Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with all his household; and many of the Corinthians hearing Paul believed and were baptized. 
ACT.18.9	 And the Lord said to Paul one night in a vision, “Do not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent; 
ACT.18.10	for I am with you, and no man shall attack you to harm you; for I have many people in this city.” 
ACT.18.11	And he stayed a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
ACT.18.12	But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack upon Paul and brought him before the tribunal, 
ACT.18.13	saying, “This man is persuading men to worship God contrary to the law.” 
ACT.18.14	But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, “If it were a matter of wrongdoing or vicious crime, I should have reason to bear with you, O Jews; 
ACT.18.15	but since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves; I refuse to be a judge of these things.” 
ACT.18.16	And he drove them from the tribunal. 
ACT.18.17	And they all seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the tribunal. But Gallio paid no attention to this.
ACT.18.18	After this Paul stayed many days longer, and then took leave of the brethren and sailed for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila. At Cenchre-ae he cut his hair, for he had a vow. 
ACT.18.19	And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there; but he himself went into the synagogue and argued with the Jews. 
ACT.18.20	When they asked him to stay for a longer period, he declined; 
ACT.18.21	but on taking leave of them he said, “I will return to you if God wills,” and he set sail from Ephesus.
ACT.18.22	When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and then went down to Antioch. 
ACT.18.23	After spending some time there he departed and went from place to place through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
ACT.18.24	Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, well versed in the scriptures. 
ACT.18.25	He had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John. 
ACT.18.26	He began to speak boldly in the synagogue; but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him and expounded to him the way of God more accurately. 
ACT.18.27	And when he wished to cross to Achaia, the brethren encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him. When he arrived, he greatly helped those who through grace had believed, 
ACT.18.28	for he powerfully confuted the Jews in public, showing by the scriptures that the Christ was Jesus.
ACT.19.1	While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the upper country and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples. 
ACT.19.2	And he said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” And they said, “No, we have never even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.” 
ACT.19.3	And he said, “Into what then were you baptized?” They said, “Into John's baptism.” 
ACT.19.4	And Paul said, “John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus.” 
ACT.19.5	On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
ACT.19.6	And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spoke with tongues and prophesied. 
ACT.19.7	There were about twelve of them in all.
ACT.19.8	And he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly, arguing and pleading about the kingdom of God; 
ACT.19.9	but when some were stubborn and disbelieved, speaking evil of the Way before the congregation, he withdrew from them, taking the disciples with him, and argued daily in the hall of Tyrannus.
ACT.19.10	This continued for two years, so that all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
ACT.19.11	And God did extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul, 
ACT.19.12	so that handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick, and diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them. 
ACT.19.13	Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to pronounce the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, “I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.” 
ACT.19.14	Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this. 
ACT.19.15	But the evil spirit answered them, “Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?” 
ACT.19.16	And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, mastered all of them, and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. 
ACT.19.17	And this became known to all residents of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks; and fear fell upon them all; and the name of the Lord Jesus was extolled. 
ACT.19.18	Many also of those who were now believers came, confessing and divulging their practices. 
ACT.19.19	And a number of those who practiced magic arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all; and they counted the value of them and found it came to fifty thousand pieces of silver. 
ACT.19.20	So the word of the Lord grew and prevailed mightily.
ACT.19.21	Now after these events Paul resolved in the Spirit to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Jerusalem, saying, “After I have been there, I must also see Rome.” 
ACT.19.22	And having sent into Macedonia two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.
ACT.19.23	About that time there arose no little stir concerning the Way. 
ACT.19.24	For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen. 
ACT.19.25	These he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, “Men, you know that from this business we have our wealth. 
ACT.19.26	And you see and hear that not only at Ephesus but almost throughout all Asia this Paul has persuaded and turned away a considerable company of people, saying that gods made with hands are not gods. 
ACT.19.27	And there is danger not only that this trade of ours may come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis may count for nothing, and that she may even be deposed from her magnificence, she whom all Asia and the world worship.”
ACT.19.28	When they heard this they were enraged, and cried out, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” 
ACT.19.29	So the city was filled with the confusion; and they rushed together into the theater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were Paul's companions in travel. 
ACT.19.30	Paul wished to go in among the crowd, but the disciples would not let him; 
ACT.19.31	some of the Asi-archs also, who were friends of his, sent to him and begged him not to venture into the theater. 
ACT.19.32	Now some cried one thing, some another; for the assembly was in confusion, and most of them did not know why they had come together. 
ACT.19.33	Some of the crowd prompted Alexander, whom the Jews had put forward. And Alexander motioned with his hand, wishing to make a defense to the people. 
ACT.19.34	But when they recognized that he was a Jew, for about two hours they all with one voice cried out, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” 
ACT.19.35	And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, “Men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Artemis, and of the sacred stone that fell from the sky?
ACT.19.36	Seeing then that these things cannot be contradicted, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash. 
ACT.19.37	For you have brought these men here who are neither sacrilegious nor blasphemers of our goddess. 
ACT.19.38	If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against any one, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges against one another. 
ACT.19.39	But if you seek anything further,
ACT.19.40	For we are in danger of being charged with rioting today, there being no cause that we can give to justify this commotion.” 
ACT.19.41	And when he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.
ACT.20.1	After the uproar ceased, Paul sent for the disciples and having exhorted them took leave of them and departed for Macedonia. 
ACT.20.2	When he had gone through these parts and had given them much encouragement, he came to Greece. 
ACT.20.3	There he spent three months, and when a plot was made against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he determined to return through Macedonia. 
ACT.20.4	Sopater of Beroea, the son of Pyrrhus, accompanied him; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and the Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus. 
ACT.20.5	These went on and were waiting for us at Troas, 
ACT.20.6	but we sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and in five days we came to them at Troas, where we stayed for seven days.
ACT.20.7	On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul talked with them, intending to depart on the morrow; and he prolonged his speech until midnight. 
ACT.20.8	There were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered. 
ACT.20.9	And a young man named Eutychus was sitting in the window. He sank into a deep sleep as Paul talked still longer; and being overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead. 
ACT.20.10	But Paul went down and bent over him, and embracing him said, “Do not be alarmed, for his life is in him.” 
ACT.20.11	And when Paul had gone up and had broken bread and eaten, he conversed with them a long while, until daybreak, and so departed. 
ACT.20.12	And they took the lad away alive, and were not a little comforted.
ACT.20.13	But going ahead to the ship, we set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there; for so he had arranged, intending himself to go by land. 
ACT.20.14	And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene. 
ACT.20.15	And sailing from there we came the following day opposite Chios; the next day we touched at Samos; and
ACT.20.16	For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost.
ACT.20.17	And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to him the elders of the church. 
ACT.20.18	And when they came to him, he said to them:
ACT.20.18	“You yourselves know how I lived among you all the time from the first day that I set foot in Asia, 
ACT.20.19	serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials which befell me through the plots of the Jews; 
ACT.20.20	how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you in public and from house to house, 
ACT.20.21	testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance to God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. 
ACT.20.22	And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, bound in the Spirit, not knowing what shall befall me there; 
ACT.20.23	except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me. 
ACT.20.24	But I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only I may accomplish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God. 
ACT.20.25	And now, behold, I know that all you among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom will see my face no more. 
ACT.20.26	Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all of you, 
ACT.20.27	for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God. 
ACT.20.28	Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God
ACT.20.29	I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock; 
ACT.20.30	and from among your own selves will arise men speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them. 
ACT.20.31	Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish every one with tears. 
ACT.20.32	And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified. 
ACT.20.33	I coveted no one's silver or gold or apparel. 
ACT.20.34	You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities, and to those who were with me. 
ACT.20.35	In all things I have shown you that by so toiling one must help the weak, remembering the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’ ”
ACT.20.36	And when he had spoken thus, he knelt down and prayed with them all. 
ACT.20.37	And they all wept and embraced Paul and kissed him, 
ACT.20.38	sorrowing most of all because of the word he had spoken, that they should see his face no more. And they brought him to the ship.
ACT.21.1	And when we had parted from them and set sail, we came by a straight course to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.
ACT.21.2	And having found a ship crossing to Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set sail. 
ACT.21.3	When we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload its cargo. 
ACT.21.4	And having sought out the disciples, we stayed there for seven days. Through the Spirit they told Paul not to go on to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.5	And when our days there were ended, we departed and went on our journey; and they all, with wives and children, brought us on our way till we were outside the city; and kneeling down on the beach we prayed and bade one another farewell. 
ACT.21.6	Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home.
ACT.21.7	When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais; and we greeted the brethren and stayed with them for one day. 
ACT.21.8	On the morrow we departed and came to Caesarea; and we entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him. 
ACT.21.9	And he had four unmarried daughters, who prophesied. 
ACT.21.10	While we were staying for some days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. 
ACT.21.11	And coming to us he took Paul's girdle and bound his own feet and hands, and said, “Thus says the Holy Spirit, ‘So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this girdle and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.’ ” 
ACT.21.12	When we heard this, we and the people there begged him not to go up to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.13	Then Paul answered, “What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.” 
ACT.21.14	And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased and said, “The will of the Lord be done.”
ACT.21.15	After these days we made ready and went up to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.16	And some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, bringing us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.
ACT.21.17	When we had come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly. 
ACT.21.18	On the following day Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present. 
ACT.21.19	After greeting them, he related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry. 
ACT.21.20	And when they heard it, they glorified God. And they said to him, “You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed; they are all zealous for the law, 
ACT.21.21	and they have been told about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or observe the customs. 
ACT.21.22	What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come. 
ACT.21.23	Do therefore what we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow; 
ACT.21.24	take these men and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. Thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you but that you yourself live in observance of the law. 
ACT.21.25	But as for the Gentiles who have believed, we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled
ACT.21.26	Then Paul took the men, and the next day he purified himself with them and went into the temple, to give notice when the days of purification would be fulfilled and the offering presented for every one of them.
ACT.21.27	When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, who had seen him in the temple, stirred up all the crowd, and laid hands on him, 
ACT.21.28	crying out, “Men of Israel, help! This is the man who is teaching men everywhere against the people and the law and this place; moreover he also brought Greeks into the temple, and he has defiled this holy place.” 
ACT.21.29	For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple. 
ACT.21.30	Then all the city was aroused, and the people ran together; they seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and at once the gates were shut. 
ACT.21.31	And as they were trying to kill him, word came to the tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion. 
ACT.21.32	He at once took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them; and when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. 
ACT.21.33	Then the tribune came up and arrested him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains. He inquired who he was and what he had done. 
ACT.21.34	Some in the crowd shouted one thing, some another; and as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks. 
ACT.21.35	And when he came to the steps, he was actually carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd; 
ACT.21.36	for the mob of the people followed, crying, “Away with him!”
ACT.21.37	As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the tribune, “May I say something to you?” And he said, “Do you know Greek? 
ACT.21.38	Are you not the Egyptian, then, who recently stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?” 
ACT.21.39	Paul replied, “I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city; I beg you, let me speak to the people.” 
ACT.21.40	And when he had given him leave, Paul, standing on the steps, motioned with his hand to the people; and when there was a great hush, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying:
ACT.22.1	“Brethren and fathers, hear the defense which I now make before you.”
ACT.22.2	And when they heard that he addressed them in the Hebrew language, they were the more quiet. And he said:
ACT.22.3	“I am a Jew, born at Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamali-el, educated according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God as you all are this day. 
ACT.22.4	 I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering to prison both men and women, 
ACT.22.5	as the high priest and the whole council of elders bear me witness. From them I received letters to the brethren, and I journeyed to Damascus to take those also who were there and bring them in bonds to Jerusalem to be punished.
ACT.22.6	“As I made my journey and drew near to Damascus, about noon a great light from heaven suddenly shone about me. 
ACT.22.7	And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?’ 
ACT.22.8	And I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And he said to me, ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth whom you are persecuting.’ 
ACT.22.9	Now those who were with me saw the light but did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me. 
ACT.22.10	And I said, ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ And the Lord said to me, ‘Rise, and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all that is appointed for you to do.’ 
ACT.22.11	And when I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and came into Damascus.
ACT.22.12	“And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there, 
ACT.22.13	came to me, and standing by me said to me, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight.’ And in that very hour I received my sight and saw him. 
ACT.22.14	And he said, ‘The God of our fathers appointed you to know his will, to see the Just One and to hear a voice from his mouth; 
ACT.22.15	for you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard. 
ACT.22.16	And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name.’
ACT.22.17	“When I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance 
ACT.22.18	and saw him saying to me, ‘Make haste and get quickly out of Jerusalem, because they will not accept your testimony about me.’ 
ACT.22.19	And I said, ‘Lord, they themselves know that in every synagogue I imprisoned and beat those who believed in thee. 
ACT.22.20	And when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I also was standing by and approving, and keeping the garments of those who killed him.’ 
ACT.22.21	And he said to me, ‘Depart; for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’ ”
ACT.22.22	Up to this word they listened to him; then they lifted up their voices and said, “Away with such a fellow from the earth! For he ought not to live.” 
ACT.22.23	And as they cried out and waved their garments and threw dust into the air, 
ACT.22.24	the tribune commanded him to be brought into the barracks, and ordered him to be examined by scourging, to find out why they shouted thus against him. 
ACT.22.25	But when they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, “Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman citizen, and uncondemned?” 
ACT.22.26	When the centurion heard that, he went to the tribune and said to him, “What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen.” 
ACT.22.27	So the tribune came and said to him, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” And he said, “Yes.” 
ACT.22.28	The tribune answered, “I bought this citizenship for a large sum.” Paul said, “But I was born a citizen.” 
ACT.22.29	So those who were about to examine him withdrew from him instantly; and the tribune also was afraid, for he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had bound him.
ACT.22.30	But on the morrow, desiring to know the real reason why the Jews accused him, he unbound him, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to meet, and he brought Paul down and set him before them.
ACT.23.1	And Paul, looking intently at the council, said, “Brethren, I have lived before God in all good conscience up to this day.” 
ACT.23.2	And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth. 
ACT.23.3	Then Paul said to him, “God shall strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting to judge me according to the law, and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck?” 
ACT.23.4	Those who stood by said, “Would you revile God's high priest?” 
ACT.23.5	 And Paul said, “I did not know, brethren, that he was the high priest; for it is written, ‘You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.’ ”
ACT.23.6	But when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, “Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; with respect to the hope and the resurrection of the dead I am on trial.” 
ACT.23.7	And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the assembly was divided. 
ACT.23.8	For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees acknowledge them all. 
ACT.23.9	Then a great clamor arose; and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and contended, “We find nothing wrong in this man. What if a spirit or an angel spoke to him?” 
ACT.23.10	And when the dissension became violent, the tribune, afraid that Paul would be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them and bring him into the barracks.
ACT.23.11	The following night the Lord stood by him and said, “Take courage, for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem, so you must bear witness also at Rome.”
ACT.23.12	When it was day, the Jews made a plot and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. 
ACT.23.13	There were more than forty who made this conspiracy. 
ACT.23.14	And they went to the chief priests and elders, and said, “We have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food till we have killed Paul. 
ACT.23.15	You therefore, along with the council, give notice now to the tribune to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case more exactly. And we are ready to kill him before he comes near.”
ACT.23.16	Now the son of Paul's sister heard of their ambush; so he went and entered the barracks and told Paul. 
ACT.23.17	And Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the tribune; for he has something to tell him.” 
ACT.23.18	So he took him and brought him to the tribune and said, “Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, as he has something to say to you.” 
ACT.23.19	The tribune took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, “What is it that you have to tell me?” 
ACT.23.20	And he said, “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more closely about him. 
ACT.23.21	But do not yield to them; for more than forty of their men lie in ambush for him, having bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him; and now they are ready, waiting for the promise from you.” 
ACT.23.22	So the tribune dismissed the young man, charging him, “Tell no one that you have informed me of this.”
ACT.23.23	Then he called two of the centurions and said, “At the third hour of the night get ready two hundred soldiers with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go as far as Caesarea. 
ACT.23.24	Also provide mounts for Paul to ride, and bring him safely to Felix the governor.” 
ACT.23.25	And he wrote a letter to this effect:
ACT.23.26	“Claudius Lysias to his Excellency the governor Felix, greeting. 
ACT.23.27	This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be killed by them, when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman citizen. 
ACT.23.28	And desiring to know the charge on which they accused him, I brought him down to their council. 
ACT.23.29	I found that he was accused about questions of their law, but charged with nothing deserving death or imprisonment. 
ACT.23.30	And when it was disclosed to me that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, ordering his accusers also to state before you what they have against him.”
ACT.23.31	So the soldiers, according to their instructions, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris. 
ACT.23.32	And on the morrow they returned to the barracks, leaving the horsemen to go on with him. 
ACT.23.33	When they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also before him. 
ACT.23.34	On reading the letter, he asked to what province he belonged. When he learned that he was from Cilicia 
ACT.23.35	he said, “I will hear you when your accusers arrive.” And he commanded him to be guarded in Herod's praetorium.
ACT.24.1	And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a spokesman, one Tertullus. They laid before the governor their case against Paul; 
ACT.24.2	and when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying:
ACT.24.2	“Since through you we enjoy much peace, and since by your provision, most excellent Felix, reforms are introduced on behalf of this nation, 
ACT.24.3	in every way and everywhere we accept this with all gratitude. 
ACT.24.4	But, to detain you no further, I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly. 
ACT.24.5	For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, an agitator among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. 
ACT.24.6	He even tried to profane the temple, but we seized him. 
ACT.24.8	By examining him yourself you will be able to learn from him about everything of which we accuse him.”
ACT.24.9	The Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that all this was so.
ACT.24.10	And when the governor had motioned to him to speak, Paul replied:
ACT.24.10	“Realizing that for many years you have been judge over this nation, I cheerfully make my defense. 
ACT.24.11	As you may ascertain, it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem; 
ACT.24.12	and they did not find me disputing with any one or stirring up a crowd, either in the temple or in the synagogues, or in the city. 
ACT.24.13	Neither can they prove to you what they now bring up against me. 
ACT.24.14	But this I admit to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, I worship the God of our fathers, believing everything laid down by the law or written in the prophets, 
ACT.24.15	having a hope in God which these themselves accept, that there will be a resurrection of both the just and the unjust. 
ACT.24.16	So I always take pains to have a clear conscience toward God and toward men. 
ACT.24.17	Now after some years I came to bring to my nation alms and offerings. 
ACT.24.18	As I was doing this, they found me purified in the temple, without any crowd or tumult. But some Jews from Asia— 
ACT.24.19	they ought to be here before you and to make an accusation, if they have anything against me. 
ACT.24.20	Or else let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the council, 
ACT.24.21	except this one thing which I cried out while standing among them, ‘With respect to the resurrection of the dead I am on trial before you this day.’ ”
ACT.24.22	But Felix, having a rather accurate knowledge of the Way, put them off, saying, “When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will decide your case.” 
ACT.24.23	Then he gave orders to the centurion that he should be kept in custody but should have some liberty, and that none of his friends should be prevented from attending to his needs.
ACT.24.24	After some days Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess; and he sent for Paul and heard him speak upon faith in Christ Jesus. 
ACT.24.25	And as he argued about justice and self-control and future judgment, Felix was alarmed and said, “Go away for the present; when I have an opportunity I will summon you.” 
ACT.24.26	At the same time he hoped that money would be given him by Paul. So he sent for him often and conversed with him. 
ACT.24.27	But when two years had elapsed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.
ACT.25.1	Now when Festus had come into his province, after three days he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea. 
ACT.25.2	And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews informed him against Paul; and they urged him, 
ACT.25.3	asking as a favor to have the man sent to Jerusalem, planning an ambush to kill him on the way. 
ACT.25.4	Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea, and that he himself intended to go there shortly. 
ACT.25.5	“So,” said he, “let the men of authority among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them accuse him.”
ACT.25.6	When he had stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea; and the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought. 
ACT.25.7	And when he had come, the Jews who had gone down from Jerusalem stood about him, bringing against him many serious charges which they could not prove. 
ACT.25.8	Paul said in his defense, “Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I offended at all.” 
ACT.25.9	But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, “Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem, and there be tried on these charges before me?” 
ACT.25.10	But Paul said, “I am standing before Caesar's tribunal, where I ought to be tried; to the Jews I have done no wrong, as you know very well. 
ACT.25.11	If then I am a wrongdoer, and have committed anything for which I deserve to die, I do not seek to escape death; but if there is nothing in their charges against me, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar.” 
ACT.25.12	Then Festus, when he had conferred with his council, answered, “You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you shall go.”
ACT.25.13	Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to welcome Festus. 
ACT.25.14	And as they stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, “There is a man left prisoner by Felix; 
ACT.25.15	and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews gave information about him, asking for sentence against him. 
ACT.25.16	I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up any one before the accused met the accusers face to face, and had opportunity to make his defense concerning the charge laid against him. 
ACT.25.17	When therefore they came together here, I made no delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought in. 
ACT.25.18	When the accusers stood up, they brought no charge in his case of such evils as I supposed; 
ACT.25.19	but they had certain points of dispute with him about their own superstition and about one Jesus, who was dead, but whom Paul asserted to be alive. 
ACT.25.20	Being at a loss how to investigate these questions, I asked whether he wished to go to Jerusalem and be tried there regarding them. 
ACT.25.21	But when Paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be held until I could send him to Caesar.” 
ACT.25.22	And Agrippa said to Festus, “I should like to hear the man myself.” “Tomorrow,” said he, “you shall hear him.”
ACT.25.23	So on the morrow Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp, and they entered the audience hall with the military tribunes and the prominent men of the city. Then by command of Festus Paul was brought in. 
ACT.25.24	And Festus said, “King Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish people petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer. 
ACT.25.25	But I found that he had done nothing deserving death; and as he himself appealed to the emperor, I decided to send him. 
ACT.25.26	But I have nothing definite to write to my lord about him. Therefore I have brought him before you, and, especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after we have examined him, I may have something to write. 
ACT.25.27	For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to indicate the charges against him.”
ACT.26.1	Agrippa said to Paul, “You have permission to speak for yourself.” Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense:
ACT.26.2	“I think myself fortunate that it is before you, King Agrippa, I am to make my defense today against all the accusations of the Jews, 
ACT.26.3	because you are especially familiar with all customs and controversies of the Jews; therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.
ACT.26.4	“My manner of life from my youth, spent from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem, is known by all the Jews. 
ACT.26.5	They have known for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that according to the strictest party of our religion I have lived as a Pharisee. 
ACT.26.6	And now I stand here on trial for hope in the promise made by God to our fathers, 
ACT.26.7	to which our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly worship night and day. And for this hope I am accused by Jews, O king! 
ACT.26.8	Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead?
ACT.26.10	And I did so in Jerusalem; I not only shut up many of the saints in prison, by authority from the chief priests, but when they were put to death I cast my vote against them. 
ACT.26.11	And I punished them often in all the synagogues and tried to make them blaspheme; and in raging fury against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.
ACT.26.12	“Thus I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests. 
ACT.26.13	At midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining round me and those who journeyed with me. 
ACT.26.14	And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, ‘Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It hurts you to kick against the goads.’ 
ACT.26.15	And I said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And the Lord said, ‘I am Jesus whom you are persecuting. 
ACT.26.16	 But rise and stand upon your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you to serve and bear witness to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you, 
ACT.26.17	delivering you from the people and from the Gentiles—to whom I send you 
ACT.26.18	 to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’
ACT.26.19	“Wherefore, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, 
ACT.26.20	but declared first to those at Damascus, then at Jerusalem and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God and perform deeds worthy of their repentance. 
ACT.26.21	For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me. 
ACT.26.22	To this day I have had the help that comes from God, and so I stand here testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would come to pass: 
ACT.26.23	that the Christ must suffer, and that, by being the first to rise from the dead, he would proclaim light both to the people and to the Gentiles.”
ACT.26.24	And as he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, “Paul, you are mad; your great learning is turning you mad.” 
ACT.26.25	But Paul said, “I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking the sober truth. 
ACT.26.26	For the king knows about these things, and to him I speak freely; for I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this was not done in a corner. 
ACT.26.27	King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.” 
ACT.26.28	And Agrippa said to Paul, “In a short time you think to make me a Christian!” 
ACT.26.29	And Paul said, “Whether short or long, I would to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day might become such as I am—except for these chains.”
ACT.26.30	Then the king rose, and the governor and Bernice and those who were sitting with them; 
ACT.26.31	and when they had withdrawn, they said to one another, “This man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment.” 
ACT.26.32	And Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.”
ACT.27.1	And when it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan Cohort, named Julius. 
ACT.27.2	And embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail to the ports along the coast of Asia, we put to sea, accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica. 
ACT.27.3	The next day we put in at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him leave to go to his friends and be cared for. 
ACT.27.4	And putting to sea from there we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were against us. 
ACT.27.5	And when we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra in Lycia. 
ACT.27.6	There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy, and put us on board. 
ACT.27.7	We sailed slowly for a number of days, and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, and as the wind did not allow us to go on, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone. 
ACT.27.8	Coasting along it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.
ACT.27.9	As much time had been lost, and the voyage was already dangerous because the fast had already gone by, Paul advised them, 
ACT.27.10	saying, “Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.” 
ACT.27.11	But the centurion paid more attention to the captain and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul said. 
ACT.27.12	And because the harbor was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised to put to sea from there, on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, looking northeast and southeast,
ACT.27.13	And when the south wind blew gently, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close inshore. 
ACT.27.14	But soon a tempestuous wind, called the northeaster, struck down from the land; 
ACT.27.15	and when the ship was caught and could not face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven. 
ACT.27.16	And running under the lee of a small island called Cauda,
ACT.27.17	after hoisting it up, they took measures
ACT.27.18	As we were violently storm-tossed, they began next day to throw the cargo overboard; 
ACT.27.19	and the third day they cast out with their own hands the tackle of the ship. 
ACT.27.20	And when neither sun nor stars appeared for many a day, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned.
ACT.27.21	As they had been long without food, Paul then came forward among them and said, “Men, you should have listened to me, and should not have set sail from Crete and incurred this injury and loss. 
ACT.27.22	I now bid you take heart; for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. 
ACT.27.23	For this very night there stood by me an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I worship, 
ACT.27.24	and he said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar; and lo, God has granted you all those who sail with you.’ 
ACT.27.25	So take heart, men, for I have faith in God that it will be exactly as I have been told. 
ACT.27.26	But we shall have to run on some island.”
ACT.27.27	When the fourteenth night had come, as we were drifting across the sea of Adria, about midnight the sailors suspected that they were nearing land. 
ACT.27.28	So they sounded and found twenty fathoms; a little farther on they sounded again and found fifteen fathoms. 
ACT.27.29	And fearing that we might run on the rocks, they let out four anchors from the stern, and prayed for day to come. 
ACT.27.30	And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, under pretense of laying out anchors from the bow, 
ACT.27.31	Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.” 
ACT.27.32	Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let it go.
ACT.27.33	As day was about to dawn, Paul urged them all to take some food, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day that you have continued in suspense and without food, having taken nothing. 
ACT.27.34	Therefore I urge you to take some food; it will give you strength, since not a hair is to perish from the head of any of you.” 
ACT.27.35	And when he had said this, he took bread, and giving thanks to God in the presence of all he broke it and began to eat. 
ACT.27.36	Then they all were encouraged and ate some food themselves. 
ACT.27.37	(We were in all two hundred and seventy-six
ACT.27.38	And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.
ACT.27.39	Now when it was day, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach, on which they planned if possible to bring the ship ashore. 
ACT.27.40	So they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the ropes that tied the rudders; then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach. 
ACT.27.41	But striking a shoal
ACT.27.42	The soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners, lest any should swim away and escape; 
ACT.27.43	but the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from carrying out their purpose. He ordered those who could swim to throw themselves overboard first and make for the land, 
ACT.27.44	and the rest on planks or on pieces of the ship. And so it was that all escaped to land.
ACT.28.1	After we had escaped, we then learned that the island was called Malta. 
ACT.28.2	And the natives showed us unusual kindness, for they kindled a fire and welcomed us all, because it had begun to rain and was cold. 
ACT.28.3	Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire, when a viper came out because of the heat and fastened on his hand. 
ACT.28.4	When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, “No doubt this man is a murderer. Though he has escaped from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live.” 
ACT.28.5	He, however, shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm. 
ACT.28.6	They waited, expecting him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead; but when they had waited a long time and saw no misfortune come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.
ACT.28.7	Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us and entertained us hospitably for three days. 
ACT.28.8	It happened that the father of Publius lay sick with fever and dysentery; and Paul visited him and prayed, and putting his hands on him healed him. 
ACT.28.9	And when this had taken place, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured. 
ACT.28.10	They presented many gifts to us;
ACT.28.11	After three months we set sail in a ship which had wintered in the island, a ship of Alexandria, with the Twin Brothers as figurehead. 
ACT.28.12	Putting in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days. 
ACT.28.13	And from there we made a circuit and arrived at Rhegium; and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli. 
ACT.28.14	There we found brethren, and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome. 
ACT.28.15	And the brethren there, when they heard of us, came as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us. On seeing them Paul thanked God and took courage. 
ACT.28.16	And when we came into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier that guarded him.
ACT.28.17	After three days he called together the local leaders of the Jews; and when they had gathered, he said to them, “Brethren, though I had done nothing against the people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. 
ACT.28.18	When they had examined me, they wished to set me at liberty, because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case. 
ACT.28.19	But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar—though I had no charge to bring against my nation. 
ACT.28.20	For this reason therefore I have asked to see you and speak with you, since it is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.” 
ACT.28.21	And they said to him, “We have received no letters from Judea about you, and none of the brethren coming here has reported or spoken any evil about you. 
ACT.28.22	But we desire to hear from you what your views are; for with regard to this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against.”
ACT.28.23	When they had appointed a day for him, they came to him at his lodging in great numbers. And he expounded the matter to them from morning till evening, testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus both from the law of Moses and from the prophets. 
ACT.28.24	And some were convinced by what he said, while others disbelieved. 
ACT.28.25	So, as they disagreed among themselves, they departed, after Paul had made one statement: “The Holy Spirit was right in saying to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet:
ACT.28.26	You shall indeed hear but never understand,
ACT.28.26	and you shall indeed see but never perceive.
ACT.28.27	For this people's heart has grown dull,
ACT.28.27	and their ears are heavy of hearing,
ACT.28.27	and their eyes they have closed;
ACT.28.27	lest they should perceive with their eyes,
ACT.28.27	and hear with their ears,
ACT.28.27	and understand with their heart,
ACT.28.27	and turn for me to heal them.’
ACT.28.30	And he lived there two whole years at his own expense,
ACT.28.31	preaching the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ quite openly and unhindered.
ROM.1.2	which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures, 
ROM.1.3	the gospel concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh 
ROM.1.4	and designated Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, 
ROM.1.5	 through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations, 
ROM.1.6	including yourselves who are called to belong to Jesus Christ;
ROM.1.7	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
ROM.1.9	For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you always in my prayers, 
ROM.1.10	 asking that somehow by God's will I may now at last succeed in coming to you. 
ROM.1.11	For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you, 
ROM.1.12	that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine. 
ROM.1.13	 I want you to know, brethren, that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles. 
ROM.1.14	 I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish: 
ROM.1.15	so I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.
ROM.1.17	 For in it the righteousness of God is revealed through faith for faith; as it is written, “He who through faith is righteous shall live.”
ROM.1.19	For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. 
ROM.1.20	 Ever since the creation of the world his invisible nature, namely, his eternal power and deity, has been clearly perceived in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse; 
ROM.1.21	 for although they knew God they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking and their senseless minds were darkened. 
ROM.1.22	Claiming to be wise, they became fools, 
ROM.1.23	 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man or birds or animals or reptiles.
ROM.1.24	Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, 
ROM.1.25	because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever! Amen.
ROM.1.26	For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. Their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural, 
ROM.1.27	and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in their own persons the due penalty for their error.
ROM.1.28	And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a base mind and to improper conduct. 
ROM.1.29	They were filled with all manner of wickedness, evil, covetousness, malice. Full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity, they are gossips, 
ROM.1.30	slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, 
ROM.1.31	foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. 
ROM.1.32	Though they know God's decree that those who do such things deserve to die, they not only do them but approve those who practice them.
ROM.2.2	We know that the judgment of God rightly falls upon those who do such things. 
ROM.2.3	Do you suppose, O man, that when you judge those who do such things and yet do them yourself, you will escape the judgment of God? 
ROM.2.4	 Or do you presume upon the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience? Do you not know that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance? 
ROM.2.5	But by your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed. 
ROM.2.6	 For he will render to every man according to his works: 
ROM.2.7	to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; 
ROM.2.8	but for those who are factious and do not obey the truth, but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and fury. 
ROM.2.9	There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, 
ROM.2.10	but glory and honor and peace for every one who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek. 
ROM.2.11	 For God shows no partiality.
ROM.2.13	 For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified. 
ROM.2.14	When Gentiles who have not the law do by nature what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. 
ROM.2.15	They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or perhaps excuse them 
ROM.2.16	 on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.
ROM.2.17	But if you call yourself a Jew and rely upon the law and boast of your relation to God 
ROM.2.18	 and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed in the law, 
ROM.2.19	and if you are sure that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, 
ROM.2.20	 a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth— 
ROM.2.21	 you then who teach others, will you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal? 
ROM.2.22	You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? 
ROM.2.23	You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law? 
ROM.2.24	 For, as it is written, “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”
ROM.2.26	 So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision? 
ROM.2.27	 Then those who are physically uncircumcised but keep the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law. 
ROM.2.28	 For he is not a real Jew who is one outwardly, nor is true circumcision something external and physical. 
ROM.2.29	 He is a Jew who is one inwardly, and real circumcision is a matter of the heart, spiritual and not literal. His praise is not from men but from God.
ROM.3.1	Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision? 
ROM.3.2	 Much in every way. To begin with, the Jews are entrusted with the oracles of God. 
ROM.3.3	What if some were unfaithful? Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God? 
ROM.3.4	 By no means! Let God be true though every man be false, as it is written,
ROM.3.4	“That thou mayest be justified in thy words,
ROM.3.4	and prevail when thou art judged.”
ROM.3.6	By no means! For then how could God judge the world? 
ROM.3.7	But if through my falsehood God's truthfulness abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner? 
ROM.3.8	 And why not do evil that good may come?—as some people slanderously charge us with saying. Their condemnation is just.
ROM.3.10	 as it is written:
ROM.3.10	“None is righteous, no, not one;
ROM.3.11	no one understands, no one seeks for God.
ROM.3.12	All have turned aside, together they have gone wrong;
ROM.3.12	no one does good, not even one.”
ROM.3.13	they use their tongues to deceive.”
ROM.3.13	“The venom of asps is under their lips.”
ROM.3.16	in their paths are ruin and misery,
ROM.3.17	and the way of peace they do not know.”
ROM.3.20	 For no human being will be justified in his sight by works of the law, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.
ROM.3.22	 the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction; 
ROM.3.23	 since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 
ROM.3.24	 they are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus, 
ROM.3.25	whom God put forward as an expiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins; 
ROM.3.26	 it was to prove at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he justifies him who has faith in Jesus.
ROM.3.27	Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. On what principle? On the principle of works? No, but on the principle of faith. 
ROM.3.28	 For we hold that a man is justified by faith apart from works of law. 
ROM.3.29	 Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, 
ROM.3.30	 since God is one; and he will justify the circumcised on the ground of their faith and the uncircumcised through their faith. 
ROM.3.31	 Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.
ROM.4.1	What then shall we say about
ROM.4.2	 For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. 
ROM.4.3	 For what does the scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.” 
ROM.4.4	 Now to one who works, his wages are not reckoned as a gift but as his due. 
ROM.4.5	 And to one who does not work but trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness. 
ROM.4.6	So also David pronounces a blessing upon the man to whom God reckons righteousness apart from works:
ROM.4.8	blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not reckon his sin.”
ROM.4.9	Is this blessing pronounced only upon the circumcised, or also upon the uncircumcised? We say that faith was reckoned to Abraham as righteousness. 
ROM.4.10	How then was it reckoned to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. 
ROM.4.11	 He received circumcision as a sign or seal of the righteousness which he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised and who thus have righteousness reckoned to them, 
ROM.4.12	and likewise the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but also follow the example of the faith which our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.
ROM.4.14	 If it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void. 
ROM.4.15	 For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression.
ROM.4.16	That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his descendants—not only to the adherents of the law but also to those who share the faith of Abraham, for he is the father of us all, 
ROM.4.17	 as it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations”—in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist. 
ROM.4.18	 In hope he believed against hope, that he should become the father of many nations; as he had been told, “So shall your descendants be.” 
ROM.4.19	 He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead because he was about a hundred years old, or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb. 
ROM.4.20	No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, 
ROM.4.21	fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. 
ROM.4.22	 That is why his faith was “reckoned to him as righteousness.” 
ROM.4.23	 But the words, “it was reckoned to him,” were written not for his sake alone, 
ROM.4.24	but for ours also. It will be reckoned to us who believe in him that raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, 
ROM.4.25	 who was put to death for our trespasses and raised for our justification.
ROM.5.2	 Through him we have obtained access
ROM.5.3	 More than that, we
ROM.5.4	and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, 
ROM.5.5	 and hope does not disappoint us, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit which has been given to us.
ROM.5.6	While we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. 
ROM.5.7	Why, one will hardly die for a righteous man—though perhaps for a good man one will dare even to die. 
ROM.5.8	 But God shows his love for us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us. 
ROM.5.9	 Since, therefore, we are now justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. 
ROM.5.10	 For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life. 
ROM.5.11	 Not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received our reconciliation.
ROM.5.13	sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law. 
ROM.5.14	 Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sins were not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come.
ROM.5.16	 And the free gift is not like the effect of that one man's sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brings justification. 
ROM.5.17	If, because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.
ROM.5.18	Then as one man's trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one man's act of righteousness leads to acquittal and life for all men. 
ROM.5.19	 For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by one man's obedience many will be made righteous. 
ROM.5.20	 Law came in, to increase the trespass; but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more, 
ROM.5.21	 so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
ROM.6.2	 By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it? 
ROM.6.3	 Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 
ROM.6.4	 We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.
ROM.6.6	 We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the sinful body might be destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin. 
ROM.6.7	 For he who has died is freed from sin. 
ROM.6.8	 But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him. 
ROM.6.9	 For we know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. 
ROM.6.10	The death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. 
ROM.6.11	 So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.
ROM.6.12	Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies, to make you obey their passions. 
ROM.6.13	 Do not yield your members to sin as instruments of wickedness, but yield yourselves to God as men who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments of righteousness. 
ROM.6.14	 For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.
ROM.6.16	 Do you not know that if you yield yourselves to any one as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness? 
ROM.6.17	But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed, 
ROM.6.18	 and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness. 
ROM.6.19	 I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once yielded your members to impurity and to greater and greater iniquity, so now yield your members to righteousness for sanctification.
ROM.6.21	 But then what return did you get from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death. 
ROM.6.22	But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the return you get is sanctification and its end, eternal life. 
ROM.6.23	 For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
ROM.7.1	Do you not know, brethren—for I am speaking to those who know the law—that the law is binding on a person only during his life? 
ROM.7.2	 Thus a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives; but if her husband dies she is discharged from the law concerning the husband. 
ROM.7.3	Accordingly, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies she is free from that law, and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress.
ROM.7.5	 While we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death. 
ROM.7.6	But now we are discharged from the law, dead to that which held us captive, so that we serve not under the old written code but in the new life of the Spirit.
ROM.7.8	 But sin, finding opportunity in the commandment, wrought in me all kinds of covetousness. Apart from the law sin lies dead. 
ROM.7.9	I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died; 
ROM.7.10	 the very commandment which promised life proved to be death to me. 
ROM.7.11	For sin, finding opportunity in the commandment, deceived me and by it killed me. 
ROM.7.12	 So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and just and good.
ROM.7.13	Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no means! It was sin, working death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure. 
ROM.7.14	 We know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin. 
ROM.7.15	 I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate. 
ROM.7.16	Now if I do what I do not want, I agree that the law is good. 
ROM.7.17	So then it is no longer I that do it, but sin which dwells within me. 
ROM.7.18	For I know that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh. I can will what is right, but I cannot do it. 
ROM.7.19	For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do. 
ROM.7.20	Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I that do it, but sin which dwells within me.
ROM.7.21	So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. 
ROM.7.22	 For I delight in the law of God, in my inmost self, 
ROM.7.23	 but I see in my members another law at war with the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin which dwells in my members. 
ROM.7.24	 Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? 
ROM.7.25	Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I of myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.
ROM.8.2	 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death. 
ROM.8.3	 For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do: sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin,
ROM.8.4	 in order that the just requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. 
ROM.8.5	 For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. 
ROM.8.6	 To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. 
ROM.8.7	For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God's law, indeed it cannot; 
ROM.8.8	 and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
ROM.8.10	 But if Christ is in you, although your bodies are dead because of sin, your spirits are alive because of righteousness. 
ROM.8.11	 If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit which dwells in you.
ROM.8.12	So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh— 
ROM.8.13	 for if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live. 
ROM.8.14	 For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. 
ROM.8.15	 For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the spirit of sonship. When we cry, “Abba! Father!” 
ROM.8.16	 it is the Spirit himself bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God, 
ROM.8.17	 and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.
ROM.8.19	 For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God; 
ROM.8.20	 for the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will but by the will of him who subjected it in hope; 
ROM.8.21	 because the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the glorious liberty of the children of God. 
ROM.8.22	 We know that the whole creation has been groaning in travail together until now; 
ROM.8.23	 and not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. 
ROM.8.24	 For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? 
ROM.8.25	But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.
ROM.8.26	Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words. 
ROM.8.27	 And he who searches the hearts of men knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because
ROM.8.28	We know that in everything God works for good
ROM.8.29	 For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the first-born among many brethren. 
ROM.8.30	And those whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified.
ROM.8.32	 He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, will he not also give us all things with him? 
ROM.8.33	 Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies; 
ROM.8.34	 who is to condemn? Is it Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us?
ROM.8.35	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? 
ROM.8.36	 As it is written,
ROM.8.36	“For thy sake we are being killed all the day long;
ROM.8.36	we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.”
ROM.8.38	For I am sure that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, 
ROM.8.39	nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
ROM.9.1	I am speaking the truth in Christ, I am not lying; my conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit, 
ROM.9.2	that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. 
ROM.9.3	 For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen by race. 
ROM.9.4	 They are Israelites, and to them belong the sonship, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises; 
ROM.9.5	to them belong the patriarchs, and of their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ. God who is over all be blessed for ever.
ROM.9.7	 and not all are children of Abraham because they are his descendants; but “Through Isaac shall your descendants be named.” 
ROM.9.8	 This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are reckoned as descendants. 
ROM.9.9	 For this is what the promise said, “About this time I will return and Sarah shall have a son.” 
ROM.9.10	 And not only so, but also when Rebecca had conceived children by one man, our forefather Isaac, 
ROM.9.11	though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad, in order that God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of his call, 
ROM.9.12	 she was told, “The elder will serve the younger.” 
ROM.9.13	 As it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”
ROM.9.15	 For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.” 
ROM.9.16	So it depends not upon man's will or exertion, but upon God's mercy. 
ROM.9.17	 For the scripture says to Pharaoh, “I have raised you up for the very purpose of showing my power in you, so that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth.” 
ROM.9.18	 So then he has mercy upon whomever he wills, and he hardens the heart of whomever he wills.
ROM.9.19	You will say to me then, “Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?” 
ROM.9.20	 But who are you, a man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, “Why have you made me thus?” 
ROM.9.21	 Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for beauty and another for menial use? 
ROM.9.22	 What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience the vessels of wrath made for destruction, 
ROM.9.23	 in order to make known the riches of his glory for the vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory, 
ROM.9.24	 even us whom he has called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles? 
ROM.9.25	 As indeed he says in Hosea,
ROM.9.25	“Those who were not my people
ROM.9.25	I will call ‘my people,’
ROM.9.25	and her who was not beloved
ROM.9.25	I will call ‘my beloved.’ ”
ROM.9.26	they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’ ”
ROM.9.28	for the Lord will execute his sentence upon the earth with rigor and dispatch.” 
ROM.9.29	 And as Isaiah predicted,
ROM.9.29	“If the Lord of hosts had not left us children,
ROM.9.29	we would have fared like Sodom and been made like Gomorrah.”
ROM.9.31	 but that Israel who pursued the righteousness which is based on law did not succeed in fulfilling that law. 
ROM.9.32	 Why? Because they did not pursue it through faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone, 
ROM.9.33	 as it is written,
ROM.9.33	“Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone that will make men stumble,
ROM.9.33	a rock that will make them fall;
ROM.9.33	and he who believes in him will not be put to shame.”
ROM.10.1	Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved. 
ROM.10.2	 I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but it is not enlightened. 
ROM.10.3	 For, being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness. 
ROM.10.4	 For Christ is the end of the law, that every one who has faith may be justified.
ROM.10.6	 But the righteousness based on faith says, Do not say in your heart, “Who will ascend into heaven?” (that is, to bring Christ down) 
ROM.10.7	or “Who will descend into the abyss?” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). 
ROM.10.8	 But what does it say? The word is near you, on your lips and in your heart (that is, the word of faith which we preach); 
ROM.10.9	 because, if you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 
ROM.10.10	For man believes with his heart and so is justified, and he confesses with his lips and so is saved. 
ROM.10.11	 The scripture says, “No one who believes in him will be put to shame.” 
ROM.10.12	 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and bestows his riches upon all who call upon him. 
ROM.10.13	 For, “every one who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.”
ROM.10.14	But how are men to call upon him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without a preacher? 
ROM.10.15	 And how can men preach unless they are sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who preach good news!” 
ROM.10.16	 But they have not all obeyed the gospel; for Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us?” 
ROM.10.17	So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes by the preaching of Christ.
ROM.10.18	“Their voice has gone out to all the earth,
ROM.10.18	and their words to the ends of the world.”
ROM.10.19	“I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation;
ROM.10.19	with a foolish nation I will make you angry.”
ROM.10.20	“I have been found by those who did not seek me;
ROM.10.20	I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me.”
ROM.11.2	 God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel? 
ROM.11.3	“Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have demolished thy altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.” 
ROM.11.4	 But what is God's reply to him? “I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.” 
ROM.11.5	 So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace. 
ROM.11.6	 But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace.
ROM.11.8	 as it is written,
ROM.11.8	“God gave them a spirit of stupor,
ROM.11.8	eyes that should not see and ears that should not hear,
ROM.11.8	down to this very day.”
ROM.11.9	“Let their table become a snare and a trap,
ROM.11.9	a pitfall and a retribution for them;
ROM.11.10	let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see,
ROM.11.10	and bend their backs for ever.”
ROM.11.12	Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!
ROM.11.14	 in order to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them. 
ROM.11.15	 For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead? 
ROM.11.16	If the dough offered as first fruits is holy, so is the whole lump; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.
ROM.11.17	But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in their place to share the richness
ROM.11.18	do not boast over the branches. If you do boast, remember it is not you that support the root, but the root that supports you. 
ROM.11.19	You will say, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.” 
ROM.11.20	 That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast only through faith. So do not become proud, but stand in awe. 
ROM.11.21	For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. 
ROM.11.22	Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness; otherwise you too will be cut off. 
ROM.11.23	And even the others, if they do not persist in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again. 
ROM.11.24	For if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree.
ROM.11.26	 and so all Israel will be saved; as it is written,
ROM.11.26	“The Deliverer will come from Zion,
ROM.11.26	he will banish ungodliness from Jacob”;
ROM.11.27	when I take away their sins.”
ROM.11.28	As regards the gospel they are enemies of God, for your sake; but as regards election they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers. 
ROM.11.29	For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable. 
ROM.11.30	Just as you were once disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience, 
ROM.11.31	so they have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may
ROM.11.32	 For God has consigned all men to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all.
ROM.11.34	or who has been his counselor?”
ROM.11.35	that he might be repaid?”
ROM.12.2	 Do not be conformed to this world
ROM.12.3	For by the grace given to me I bid every one among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith which God has assigned him. 
ROM.12.4	 For as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, 
ROM.12.5	 so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another. 
ROM.12.6	 Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith; 
ROM.12.7	if service, in our serving; he who teaches, in his teaching; 
ROM.12.8	he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who contributes, in liberality; he who gives aid, with zeal; he who does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness.
ROM.12.9	Let love be genuine; hate what is evil, hold fast to what is good; 
ROM.12.10	love one another with brotherly affection; outdo one another in showing honor. 
ROM.12.11	Never flag in zeal, be aglow with the Spirit, serve the Lord. 
ROM.12.12	 Rejoice in your hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer. 
ROM.12.13	Contribute to the needs of the saints, practice hospitality.
ROM.12.15	Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. 
ROM.12.16	 Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly;
ROM.12.17	 Repay no one evil for evil, but take thought for what is noble in the sight of all. 
ROM.12.18	 If possible, so far as it depends upon you, live peaceably with all. 
ROM.12.19	 Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it
ROM.12.20	 No, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals upon his head.” 
ROM.12.21	Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
ROM.13.2	Therefore he who resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. 
ROM.13.3	 For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of him who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, 
ROM.13.4	 for he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain; he is the servant of God to execute his wrath on the wrongdoer. 
ROM.13.5	Therefore one must be subject, not only to avoid God's wrath but also for the sake of conscience. 
ROM.13.6	For the same reason you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing. 
ROM.13.7	 Pay all of them their dues, taxes to whom taxes are due, revenue to whom revenue is due, respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom honor is due.
ROM.13.9	 The commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this sentence, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” 
ROM.13.10	 Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.
ROM.13.12	 the night is far gone, the day is at hand. Let us then cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light; 
ROM.13.13	 let us conduct ourselves becomingly as in the day, not in reveling and drunkenness, not in debauchery and licentiousness, not in quarreling and jealousy. 
ROM.13.14	 But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.
ROM.14.1	As for the man who is weak in faith, welcome him, but not for disputes over opinions. 
ROM.14.2	One believes he may eat anything, while the weak man eats only vegetables. 
ROM.14.3	 Let not him who eats despise him who abstains, and let not him who abstains pass judgment on him who eats; for God has welcomed him. 
ROM.14.4	Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. And he will be upheld, for the Master is able to make him stand.
ROM.14.6	He who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord. He also who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, since he gives thanks to God; while he who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God. 
ROM.14.7	 None of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself. 
ROM.14.8	 If we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord; so then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's. 
ROM.14.9	For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.
ROM.14.11	 for it is written,
ROM.14.11	“As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me,
ROM.14.11	and every tongue shall give praise
ROM.14.12	So each of us shall give account of himself to God.
ROM.14.14	I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself; but it is unclean for any one who thinks it unclean. 
ROM.14.15	 If your brother is being injured by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. Do not let what you eat cause the ruin of one for whom Christ died. 
ROM.14.16	 So do not let your good be spoken of as evil. 
ROM.14.17	For the kingdom of God is not food and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit; 
ROM.14.18	he who thus serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men. 
ROM.14.19	 Let us then pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding. 
ROM.14.20	 Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God. Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong for any one to make others fall by what he eats; 
ROM.14.21	 it is right not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that makes your brother stumble.
ROM.14.22	 The faith that you have, keep between yourself and God; happy is he who has no reason to judge himself for what he approves. 
ROM.14.23	But he who has doubts is condemned, if he eats, because he does not act from faith; for whatever does not proceed from faith is sin.
ROM.15.1	We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak, and not to please ourselves; 
ROM.15.2	let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to edify him. 
ROM.15.3	 For Christ did not please himself; but, as it is written, “The reproaches of those who reproached thee fell on me.” 
ROM.15.4	 For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that by steadfastness and by the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope. 
ROM.15.5	 May the God of steadfastness and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus, 
ROM.15.6	that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
ROM.15.7	Welcome one another, therefore, as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God. 
ROM.15.8	For I tell you that Christ became a servant to the circumcised to show God's truthfulness, in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs, 
ROM.15.9	 and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written,
ROM.15.9	“Therefore I will praise thee among the Gentiles,
ROM.15.9	and sing to thy name”;
ROM.15.10	“Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people”;
ROM.15.11	“Praise the Lord, all Gentiles,
ROM.15.11	and let all the peoples praise him”;
ROM.15.12	“The root of Jesse shall come,
ROM.15.12	he who rises to rule the Gentiles;
ROM.15.12	in him shall the Gentiles hope.”
ROM.15.13	May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.
ROM.15.14	I myself am satisfied about you, my brethren, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able to instruct one another. 
ROM.15.15	But on some points I have written to you very boldly by way of reminder, because of the grace given me by God 
ROM.15.16	 to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit. 
ROM.15.17	In Christ Jesus, then, I have reason to be proud of my work for God. 
ROM.15.18	 For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has wrought through me to win obedience from the Gentiles, by word and deed, 
ROM.15.19	 by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Holy Spirit, so that from Jerusalem and as far round as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ, 
ROM.15.20	 thus making it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where Christ has already been named, lest I build on another man's foundation, 
ROM.15.21	 but as it is written,
ROM.15.21	“They shall see who have never been told of him,
ROM.15.21	and they shall understand who have never heard of him.”
ROM.15.23	 But now, since I no longer have any room for work in these regions, and since I have longed for many years to come to you, 
ROM.15.24	 I hope to see you in passing as I go to Spain, and to be sped on my journey there by you, once I have enjoyed your company for a little. 
ROM.15.25	 At present, however, I am going to Jerusalem with aid for the saints. 
ROM.15.26	 For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the saints at Jerusalem; 
ROM.15.27	 they were pleased to do it, and indeed they are in debt to them, for if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings, they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings. 
ROM.15.28	 When therefore I have completed this, and have delivered to them what has been raised,
ROM.15.29	 and I know that when I come to you I shall come in the fulness of the blessing
ROM.15.30	I appeal to you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God on my behalf, 
ROM.15.31	 that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints, 
ROM.15.32	 so that by God's will I may come to you with joy and be refreshed in your company. 
ROM.15.33	 The God of peace be with you all. Amen.
ROM.16.1	I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a deaconess of the church at Cenchre-ae, 
ROM.16.2	that you may receive her in the Lord as befits the saints, and help her in whatever she may require from you, for she has been a helper of many and of myself as well.
ROM.16.4	who risked their necks for my life, to whom not only I but also all the churches of the Gentiles give thanks; 
ROM.16.5	 greet also the church in their house. Greet my beloved Epaenetus, who was the first convert in Asia for Christ. 
ROM.16.6	Greet Mary, who has worked hard among you. 
ROM.16.7	Greet Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners; they are men of note among the apostles, and they were in Christ before me. 
ROM.16.8	Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord. 
ROM.16.9	Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and my beloved Stachys. 
ROM.16.10	Greet Apelles, who is approved in Christ. Greet those who belong to the family of Aristobulus. 
ROM.16.11	Greet my kinsman Herodion. Greet those in the Lord who belong to the family of Narcissus. 
ROM.16.12	Greet those workers in the Lord, Tryphaena and Tryphosa. Greet the beloved Persis, who has worked hard in the Lord. 
ROM.16.13	Greet Rufus, eminent in the Lord, also his mother and mine. 
ROM.16.14	Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brethren who are with them. 
ROM.16.15	Greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them. 
ROM.16.16	 Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you.
ROM.16.18	For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites,
ROM.16.19	 For while your obedience is known to all, so that I rejoice over you, I would have you wise as to what is good and guileless as to what is evil; 
ROM.16.20	 then the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
ROM.16.22	I Tertius, the writer of this letter, greet you in the Lord.
ROM.16.25	Now to him who is able to strengthen you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret for long ages 
ROM.16.26	but is now disclosed and through the prophetic writings is made known to all nations, according to the command of the eternal God, to bring about the obedience of faith— 
ROM.16.27	to the only wise God be glory for evermore through Jesus Christ! Amen.
1CO.1.5	that in every way you were enriched in him with all speech and all knowledge— 
1CO.1.6	even as the testimony to Christ was confirmed among you— 
1CO.1.7	so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift, as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ; 
1CO.1.8	 who will sustain you to the end, guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
1CO.1.9	 God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
1CO.1.10	I appeal to you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree and that there be no dissensions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment. 
1CO.1.11	For it has been reported to me by Chloe's people that there is quarreling among you, my brethren. 
1CO.1.12	 What I mean is that each one of you says, “I belong to Paul,” or “I belong to Apollos,” or “I belong to Cephas,” or “I belong to Christ.” 
1CO.1.13	 Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? 
1CO.1.14	 I am thankful
1CO.1.15	lest any one should say that you were baptized in my name. 
1CO.1.16	 (I did baptize also the household of Stephanas. Beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized any one else.) 
1CO.1.17	 For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and not with eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.
1CO.1.18	For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 
1CO.1.19	 For it is written,
1CO.1.19	“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,
1CO.1.19	and the cleverness of the clever I will thwart.”
1CO.1.20	Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 
1CO.1.21	For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe. 
1CO.1.22	 For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, 
1CO.1.23	 but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, 
1CO.1.24	but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. 
1CO.1.25	For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
1CO.1.26	For consider your call, brethren; not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth; 
1CO.1.27	 but God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise, God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong, 
1CO.1.28	 God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, 
1CO.1.29	 so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. 
1CO.1.30	 He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, whom God made our wisdom, our righteousness and sanctification and redemption; 
1CO.1.31	 therefore, as it is written, “Let him who boasts, boast of the Lord.”
1CO.2.2	 For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. 
1CO.2.3	 And I was with you in weakness and in much fear and trembling; 
1CO.2.4	 and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, 
1CO.2.5	 that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.
1CO.2.7	 But we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God, which God decreed before the ages for our glorification. 
1CO.2.8	 None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. 
1CO.2.9	 But, as it is written,
1CO.2.9	“What no eye has seen, nor ear heard,
1CO.2.9	nor the heart of man conceived,
1CO.2.9	what God has prepared for those who love him,”
1CO.2.11	For what person knows a man's thoughts except the spirit of the man which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. 
1CO.2.12	 Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might understand the gifts bestowed on us by God. 
1CO.2.13	 And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who possess the Spirit.
1CO.2.15	 The spiritual man judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one. 
1CO.2.16	 “For who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?” But we have the mind of Christ.
1CO.3.2	 I fed you with milk, not solid food; for you were not ready for it; and even yet you are not ready, 
1CO.3.3	for you are still of the flesh. For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh, and behaving like ordinary men? 
1CO.3.4	 For when one says, “I belong to Paul,” and another, “I belong to Apollos,” are you not merely men?
1CO.3.6	 I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth. 
1CO.3.7	So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth. 
1CO.3.8	He who plants and he who waters are equal, and each shall receive his wages according to his labor. 
1CO.3.9	 For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, God's building.
1CO.3.11	 For no other foundation can any one lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 
1CO.3.12	Now if any one builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw— 
1CO.3.13	 each man's work will become manifest; for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done. 
1CO.3.14	If the work which any man has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward. 
1CO.3.15	 If any man's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.
1CO.3.17	If any one destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. For God's temple is holy, and that temple you are.
1CO.3.19	 For the wisdom of this world is folly with God. For it is written, “He catches the wise in their craftiness,” 
1CO.3.20	 and again, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.” 
1CO.3.21	 So let no one boast of men. For all things are yours, 
1CO.3.22	 whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future, all are yours; 
1CO.3.23	and you are Christ's; and Christ is God's.
1CO.4.2	Moreover it is required of stewards that they be found trustworthy. 
1CO.4.3	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. I do not even judge myself. 
1CO.4.4	 I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who judges me. 
1CO.4.5	 Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then every man will receive his commendation from God.
1CO.4.7	For who sees anything different in you? What have you that you did not receive? If then you received it, why do you boast as if it were not a gift?
1CO.4.8	Already you are filled! Already you have become rich! Without us you have become kings! And would that you did reign, so that we might share the rule with you! 
1CO.4.9	 For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, like men sentenced to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels and to men. 
1CO.4.10	 We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute. 
1CO.4.11	 To the present hour we hunger and thirst, we are ill-clad and buffeted and homeless, 
1CO.4.12	 and we labor, working with our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure; 
1CO.4.13	when slandered, we try to conciliate; we have become, and are now, as the refuse of the world, the offscouring of all things.
1CO.4.14	I do not write this to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved children. 
1CO.4.15	 For though you have countless guides in Christ, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel. 
1CO.4.16	I urge you, then, be imitators of me. 
1CO.4.17	 Therefore I sent
1CO.4.18	Some are arrogant, as though I were not coming to you. 
1CO.4.19	But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power. 
1CO.4.20	For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power. 
1CO.4.21	 What do you wish? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love in a spirit of gentleness?
1CO.5.2	And you are arrogant! Ought you not rather to mourn? Let him who has done this be removed from among you.
1CO.5.4	 in the name of the Lord Jesus on the man who has done such a thing. When you are assembled, and my spirit is present, with the power of our Lord Jesus, 
1CO.5.5	 you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
1CO.5.7	Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our paschal lamb, has been sacrificed. 
1CO.5.8	 Let us, therefore, celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
1CO.5.10	 not at all meaning the immoral of this world, or the greedy and robbers, or idolaters, since then you would need to go out of the world. 
1CO.5.11	 But rather I wrote
1CO.5.12	 For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge? 
1CO.5.13	 God judges those outside. “Drive out the wicked person from among you.”
1CO.6.2	Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you incompetent to try trivial cases? 
1CO.6.3	Do you not know that we are to judge angels? How much more, matters pertaining to this life! 
1CO.6.4	If then you have such cases, why do you lay them before those who are least esteemed by the church? 
1CO.6.5	I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is no man among you wise enough to decide between members of the brotherhood, 
1CO.6.6	but brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers?
1CO.6.8	But you yourselves wrong and defraud, and that even your own brethren.
1CO.6.10	nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor robbers will inherit the kingdom of God. 
1CO.6.11	 And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.
1CO.6.13	“Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food”—and God will destroy both one and the other. The body is not meant for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. 
1CO.6.14	And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power. 
1CO.6.15	 Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I therefore take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never! 
1CO.6.16	 Do you not know that he who joins himself to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, “The two shall become one flesh.” 
1CO.6.17	 But he who is united to the Lord becomes one spirit with him. 
1CO.6.18	Shun immorality. Every other sin which a man commits is outside the body; but the immoral man sins against his own body. 
1CO.6.19	 Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, which you have from God? You are not your own; 
1CO.6.20	 you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.
1CO.7.1	Now concerning the matters about which you wrote. It is well for a man not to touch a woman. 
1CO.7.2	But because of the temptation to immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. 
1CO.7.3	The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband. 
1CO.7.4	For the wife does not rule over her own body, but the husband does; likewise the husband does not rule over his own body, but the wife does. 
1CO.7.5	 Do not refuse one another except perhaps by agreement for a season, that you may devote yourselves to prayer; but then come together again, lest Satan tempt you through lack of self-control. 
1CO.7.6	I say this by way of concession, not of command. 
1CO.7.7	 I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has his own special gift from God, one of one kind and one of another.
1CO.7.8	To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain single as I do. 
1CO.7.9	 But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion.
1CO.7.10	To the married I give charge, not I but the Lord, that the wife should not separate from her husband 
1CO.7.11	(but if she does, let her remain single or else be reconciled to her husband)—and that the husband should not divorce his wife.
1CO.7.13	If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, she should not divorce him. 
1CO.7.14	For the unbelieving husband is consecrated through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is consecrated through her husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but as it is they are holy. 
1CO.7.15	But if the unbelieving partner desires to separate, let it be so; in such a case the brother or sister is not bound. For God has called us
1CO.7.16	 Wife, how do you know whether you will save your husband? Husband, how do you know whether you will save your wife?
1CO.7.18	 Was any one at the time of his call already circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision. Was any one at the time of his call uncircumcised? Let him not seek circumcision. 
1CO.7.19	 For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but keeping the commandments of God. 
1CO.7.20	Every one should remain in the state in which he was called. 
1CO.7.21	Were you a slave when called? Never mind. But if you can gain your freedom, avail yourself of the opportunity.
1CO.7.22	 For he who was called in the Lord as a slave is a freedman of the Lord. Likewise he who was free when called is a slave of Christ. 
1CO.7.23	 You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of men. 
1CO.7.24	So, brethren, in whatever state each was called, there let him remain with God.
1CO.7.25	Now concerning the unmarried,
1CO.7.26	I think that in view of the present
1CO.7.27	Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek marriage. 
1CO.7.28	But if you marry, you do not sin, and if a girl
1CO.7.29	 I mean, brethren, the appointed time has grown very short; from now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none, 
1CO.7.30	and those who mourn as though they were not mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they had no goods, 
1CO.7.31	and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it. For the form of this world is passing away.
1CO.7.33	but the married man is anxious about worldly affairs, how to please his wife, 
1CO.7.34	and his interests are divided. And the unmarried woman or girl
1CO.7.35	I say this for your own benefit, not to lay any restraint upon you, but to promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord.
1CO.7.36	If any one thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his betrothed,
1CO.7.37	But whoever is firmly established in his heart, being under no necessity but having his desire under control, and has determined this in his heart, to keep her as his betrothed,
1CO.7.38	So that he who marries his betrothed
1CO.7.40	 But in my judgment she is happier if she remains as she is. And I think that I have the Spirit of God.
1CO.8.2	 If any one imagines that he knows something, he does not yet know as he ought to know. 
1CO.8.3	 But if one loves God, one is known by him.
1CO.8.5	For although there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth—as indeed there are many “gods” and many “lords” — 
1CO.8.6	 yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.
1CO.8.8	 Food will not commend us to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do. 
1CO.8.9	 Only take care lest this liberty of yours somehow become a stumbling block to the weak. 
1CO.8.10	For if any one sees you, a man of knowledge, at table in an idol's temple, might he not be encouraged, if his conscience is weak, to eat food offered to idols? 
1CO.8.11	 And so by your knowledge this weak man is destroyed, the brother for whom Christ died. 
1CO.8.12	 Thus, sinning against your brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ. 
1CO.8.13	 Therefore, if food is a cause of my brother's falling, I will never eat meat, lest I cause my brother to fall.
1CO.9.2	If to others I am not an apostle, at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
1CO.9.3	This is my defense to those who would examine me. 
1CO.9.4	 Do we not have the right to our food and drink? 
1CO.9.5	 Do we not have the right to be accompanied by a wife,
1CO.9.6	 Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living? 
1CO.9.7	Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard without eating any of its fruit? Who tends a flock without getting some of the milk?
1CO.9.8	Do I say this on human authority? Does not the law say the same? 
1CO.9.9	 For it is written in the law of Moses, “You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the grain.” Is it for oxen that God is concerned? 
1CO.9.10	 Does he not speak entirely for our sake? It was written for our sake, because the plowman should plow in hope and the thresher thresh in hope of a share in the crop. 
1CO.9.11	 If we have sown spiritual good among you, is it too much if we reap your material benefits? 
1CO.9.12	 If others share this rightful claim upon you, do not we still more?
1CO.9.12	Nevertheless, we have not made use of this right, but we endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ. 
1CO.9.13	 Do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in the sacrificial offerings? 
1CO.9.14	 In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel.
1CO.9.16	For if I preach the gospel, that gives me no ground for boasting. For necessity is laid upon me. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! 
1CO.9.17	 For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with a commission. 
1CO.9.18	 What then is my reward? Just this: that in my preaching I may make the gospel free of charge, not making full use of my right in the gospel.
1CO.9.19	For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a slave to all, that I might win the more. 
1CO.9.20	 To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews; to those under the law I became as one under the law—though not being myself under the law—that I might win those under the law. 
1CO.9.21	 To those outside the law I became as one outside the law—not being without law toward God but under the law of Christ—that I might win those outside the law. 
1CO.9.22	 To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I might by all means save some. 
1CO.9.23	I do it all for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings.
1CO.9.25	 Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. 
1CO.9.26	Well, I do not run aimlessly, I do not box as one beating the air; 
1CO.9.27	but I pommel my body and subdue it, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified.
1CO.10.2	 and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, 
1CO.10.3	 and all ate the same supernatural
1CO.10.4	 and all drank the same supernatural
1CO.10.5	 Nevertheless with most of them God was not pleased; for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
1CO.10.7	 Do not be idolaters as some of them were; as it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to dance.” 
1CO.10.8	 We must not indulge in immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day. 
1CO.10.9	 We must not put the Lord
1CO.10.10	 nor grumble, as some of them did and were destroyed by the Destroyer. 
1CO.10.11	Now these things happened to them as a warning, but they were written down for our instruction, upon whom the end of the ages has come. 
1CO.10.12	Therefore let any one who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall. 
1CO.10.13	 No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your strength, but with the temptation will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.
1CO.10.15	I speak as to sensible men; judge for yourselves what I say. 
1CO.10.16	 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation
1CO.10.17	 Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread. 
1CO.10.18	 Consider the people of Israel;
1CO.10.19	What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? 
1CO.10.20	 No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be partners with demons. 
1CO.10.21	 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons. 
1CO.10.22	 Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?
1CO.10.24	Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor. 
1CO.10.25	Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience. 
1CO.10.26	 For “the earth is the Lord's, and everything in it.” 
1CO.10.27	If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience. 
1CO.10.28	 (But if some one says to you, “This has been offered in sacrifice,” then out of consideration for the man who informed you, and for conscience' sake— 
1CO.10.29	I mean his conscience, not yours—do not eat it.) For why should my liberty be determined by another man's scruples? 
1CO.10.30	If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks?
1CO.10.31	So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. 
1CO.10.32	 Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God, 
1CO.10.33	 just as I try to please all men in everything I do, not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, that they may be saved.
1CO.11.3	 But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God. 
1CO.11.4	Any man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head, 
1CO.11.5	 but any woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled dishonors her head—it is the same as if her head were shaven. 
1CO.11.6	For if a woman will not veil herself, then she should cut off her hair; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her wear a veil. 
1CO.11.7	 For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. 
1CO.11.8	 (For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. 
1CO.11.9	 Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.) 
1CO.11.10	That is why a woman ought to have a veil
1CO.11.11	(Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man nor man of woman; 
1CO.11.12	 for as woman was made from man, so man is now born of woman. And all things are from God.) 
1CO.11.13	Judge for yourselves; is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? 
1CO.11.14	Does not nature itself teach you that for a man to wear long hair is degrading to him, 
1CO.11.15	but if a woman has long hair, it is her pride? For her hair is given to her for a covering. 
1CO.11.16	 If any one is disposed to be contentious, we recognize no other practice, nor do the churches of God.
1CO.11.17	But in the following instructions I do not commend you, because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse. 
1CO.11.18	 For, in the first place, when you assemble as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you; and I partly believe it, 
1CO.11.19	for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized. 
1CO.11.20	When you meet together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat. 
1CO.11.21	For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal, and one is hungry and another is drunk. 
1CO.11.22	What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No, I will not.
1CO.11.24	and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “This is my body which is for
1CO.11.25	 In the same way also the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” 
1CO.11.26	 For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
1CO.11.27	Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord. 
1CO.11.28	Let a man examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. 
1CO.11.29	For any one who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself. 
1CO.11.30	That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died.
1CO.11.31	But if we judged ourselves truly, we should not be judged. 
1CO.11.32	 But when we are judged by the Lord, we are chastened
1CO.11.33	So then, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another— 
1CO.11.34	 if any one is hungry, let him eat at home—lest you come together to be condemned. About the other things I will give directions when I come.
1CO.12.1	Now concerning spiritual gifts,
1CO.12.2	 You know that when you were heathen, you were led astray to dumb idols, however you may have been moved. 
1CO.12.3	 Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God ever says “Jesus be cursed!” and no one can say “Jesus is Lord” except by the Holy Spirit.
1CO.12.4	Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; 
1CO.12.5	and there are varieties of service, but the same Lord; 
1CO.12.6	and there are varieties of working, but it is the same God who inspires them all in every one. 
1CO.12.7	To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. 
1CO.12.8	To one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit, 
1CO.12.9	to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, 
1CO.12.10	 to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. 
1CO.12.11	All these are inspired by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as he wills.
1CO.12.13	 For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.
1CO.12.14	For the body does not consist of one member but of many. 
1CO.12.15	If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body. 
1CO.12.16	And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body. 
1CO.12.17	If the whole body were an eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell? 
1CO.12.18	But as it is, God arranged the organs in the body, each one of them, as he chose. 
1CO.12.19	If all were a single organ, where would the body be? 
1CO.12.20	As it is, there are many parts, yet one body. 
1CO.12.21	The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.” 
1CO.12.22	On the contrary, the parts of the body which seem to be weaker are indispensable, 
1CO.12.23	and those parts of the body which we think less honorable we invest with the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty, 
1CO.12.24	which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving the greater honor to the inferior part, 
1CO.12.25	that there may be no discord in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another. 
1CO.12.26	If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.
1CO.12.28	 And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, then healers, helpers, administrators, speakers in various kinds of tongues. 
1CO.12.29	Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? 
1CO.12.30	Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? 
1CO.12.31	But earnestly desire the higher gifts.
1CO.12.31	And I will show you a still more excellent way.
1CO.13.2	 And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 
1CO.13.3	If I give away all I have, and if I deliver my body to be burned,
1CO.13.4	Love is patient and kind; love is not jealous or boastful; 
1CO.13.5	 it is not arrogant or rude. Love does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; 
1CO.13.6	it does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the right. 
1CO.13.7	 Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
1CO.13.8	Love never ends; as for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. 
1CO.13.9	For our knowledge is imperfect and our prophecy is imperfect; 
1CO.13.10	but when the perfect comes, the imperfect will pass away. 
1CO.13.11	When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; when I became a man, I gave up childish ways. 
1CO.13.12	For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall understand fully, even as I have been fully understood. 
1CO.13.13	So faith, hope, love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
1CO.14.1	Make love your aim, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy. 
1CO.14.2	For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit. 
1CO.14.3	On the other hand, he who prophesies speaks to men for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation. 
1CO.14.4	He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church. 
1CO.14.5	Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but even more to prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than he who speaks in tongues, unless some one interprets, so that the church may be edified.
1CO.14.6	Now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how shall I benefit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching? 
1CO.14.7	If even lifeless instruments, such as the flute or the harp, do not give distinct notes, how will any one know what is played? 
1CO.14.8	And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle? 
1CO.14.9	So with yourselves; if you in a tongue utter speech that is not intelligible, how will any one know what is said? For you will be speaking into the air. 
1CO.14.10	There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning; 
1CO.14.11	but if I do not know the meaning of the language, I shall be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me. 
1CO.14.12	So with yourselves; since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church.
1CO.14.13	Therefore, he who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret. 
1CO.14.14	For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful. 
1CO.14.15	 What am I to do? I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the mind also; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the mind also. 
1CO.14.16	 Otherwise, if you bless
1CO.14.17	For you may give thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified. 
1CO.14.18	I thank God that I speak in tongues more than you all; 
1CO.14.19	nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind, in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.
1CO.14.21	 In the law it is written, “By men of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.” 
1CO.14.22	Thus, tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is not for unbelievers but for believers. 
1CO.14.23	If, therefore, the whole church assembles and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are mad? 
1CO.14.24	But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all, 
1CO.14.25	the secrets of his heart are disclosed; and so, falling on his face, he will worship God and declare that God is really among you.
1CO.14.27	If any speak in a tongue, let there be only two or at most three, and each in turn; and let one interpret. 
1CO.14.28	But if there is no one to interpret, let each of them keep silence in church and speak to himself and to God. 
1CO.14.29	Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said. 
1CO.14.30	If a revelation is made to another sitting by, let the first be silent. 
1CO.14.31	For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged; 
1CO.14.32	and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. 
1CO.14.33	For God is not a God of confusion but of peace.
1CO.14.33	As in all the churches of the saints, 
1CO.14.34	 the women should keep silence in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be subordinate, as even the law says. 
1CO.14.35	If there is anything they desire to know, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church. 
1CO.14.36	What! Did the word of God originate with you, or are you the only ones it has reached?
1CO.14.37	If any one thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual, he should acknowledge that what I am writing to you is a command of the Lord. 
1CO.14.38	If any one does not recognize this, he is not recognized. 
1CO.14.39	So, my brethren, earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues; 
1CO.14.40	but all things should be done decently and in order.
1CO.15.1	Now I would remind you, brethren, in what terms I preached to you the gospel, which you received, in which you stand, 
1CO.15.2	by which you are saved, if you hold it fast—unless you believed in vain.
1CO.15.4	 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures, 
1CO.15.5	 and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. 
1CO.15.6	Then he appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. 
1CO.15.7	Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. 
1CO.15.8	 Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me. 
1CO.15.9	 For I am the least of the apostles, unfit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. 
1CO.15.10	But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God which is with me. 
1CO.15.11	Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.
1CO.15.12	Now if Christ is preached as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 
1CO.15.13	But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised; 
1CO.15.14	 if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain. 
1CO.15.15	We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified of God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised. 
1CO.15.16	For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised. 
1CO.15.17	If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. 
1CO.15.18	 Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. 
1CO.15.19	If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most to be pitied.
1CO.15.20	But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep. 
1CO.15.21	 For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. 
1CO.15.22	 For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. 
1CO.15.23	 But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ. 
1CO.15.24	Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power. 
1CO.15.25	 For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. 
1CO.15.26	The last enemy to be destroyed is death. 
1CO.15.27	 “For God
1CO.15.28	 When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things under him, that God may be everything to every one.
1CO.15.29	Otherwise, what do people mean by being baptized on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized on their behalf? 
1CO.15.30	 Why am I in peril every hour? 
1CO.15.31	 I protest, brethren, by my pride in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die every day! 
1CO.15.32	 What do I gain if, humanly speaking, I fought with beasts at Ephesus? If the dead are not raised, “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.” 
1CO.15.33	 Do not be deceived: “Bad company ruins good morals.” 
1CO.15.34	 Come to your right mind, and sin no more. For some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.
1CO.15.35	But some one will ask, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?” 
1CO.15.36	 You foolish man! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. 
1CO.15.37	And what you sow is not the body which is to be, but a bare kernel, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain. 
1CO.15.38	 But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body. 
1CO.15.39	For not all flesh is alike, but there is one kind for men, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish. 
1CO.15.40	There are celestial bodies and there are terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another. 
1CO.15.41	There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.
1CO.15.43	It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. 
1CO.15.44	It is sown a physical body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body. 
1CO.15.45	 Thus it is written, “The first man Adam became a living being”; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit. 
1CO.15.46	But it is not the spiritual which is first but the physical, and then the spiritual. 
1CO.15.47	The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven. 
1CO.15.48	As was the man of dust, so are those who are of the dust; and as is the man of heaven, so are those who are of heaven. 
1CO.15.49	Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall
1CO.15.50	I tell you this, brethren: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.
1CO.15.52	in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed. 
1CO.15.53	For this perishable nature must put on the imperishable, and this mortal nature must put on immortality. 
1CO.15.54	 When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written:
1CO.15.54	“Death is swallowed up in victory.”
1CO.15.55	O death, where is thy sting?”
1CO.15.56	The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. 
1CO.15.57	But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1CO.15.58	Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain.
1CO.16.2	 On the first day of every week, each of you is to put something aside and store it up, as he may prosper, so that contributions need not be made when I come. 
1CO.16.3	 And when I arrive, I will send those whom you accredit by letter to carry your gift to Jerusalem. 
1CO.16.4	If it seems advisable that I should go also, they will accompany me.
1CO.16.6	and perhaps I will stay with you or even spend the winter, so that you may speed me on my journey, wherever I go. 
1CO.16.7	 For I do not want to see you now just in passing; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits. 
1CO.16.8	 But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, 
1CO.16.9	 for a wide door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.
1CO.16.11	So let no one despise him. Speed him on his way in peace, that he may return to me; for I am expecting him with the brethren.
1CO.16.14	Let all that you do be done in love.
1CO.16.15	Now, brethren, you know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints; 
1CO.16.16	I urge you to be subject to such men and to every fellow worker and laborer. 
1CO.16.17	I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they have made up for your absence; 
1CO.16.18	for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours. Give recognition to such men.
1CO.16.20	 All the brethren send greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
1CO.16.22	 If any one has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed. Our Lord, come!
1CO.16.23	 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. 
1CO.16.24	My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
2CO.1.1	To the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia:
2CO.1.4	 who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. 
2CO.1.5	For as we share abundantly in Christ's sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too.
2CO.1.6	If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; and if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we suffer. 
2CO.1.7	Our hope for you is unshaken; for we know that as you share in our sufferings, you will also share in our comfort.
2CO.1.8	For we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of the affliction we experienced in Asia; for we were so utterly, unbearably crushed that we despaired of life itself. 
2CO.1.9	Why, we felt that we had received the sentence of death; but that was to make us rely not on ourselves but on God who raises the dead; 
2CO.1.10	he delivered us from so deadly a peril, and he will deliver us; on him we have set our hope that he will deliver us again. 
2CO.1.11	You also must help us by prayer, so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us in answer to many prayers.
2CO.1.12	For our boast is this, the testimony of our conscience that we have behaved in the world, and still more toward you, with holiness and godly sincerity, not by earthly wisdom but by the grace of God. 
2CO.1.13	For we write you nothing but what you can read and understand; I hope you will understand fully, 
2CO.1.14	as you have understood in part, that you can be proud of us as we can be of you, on the day of the Lord Jesus.
2CO.1.15	Because I was sure of this, I wanted to come to you first, so that you might have a double pleasure;
2CO.1.16	 I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and to come back to you from Macedonia and have you send me on my way to Judea. 
2CO.1.17	Was I vacillating when I wanted to do this? Do I make my plans like a worldly man, ready to say Yes and No at once? 
2CO.1.18	As surely as God is faithful, our word to you has not been Yes and No. 
2CO.1.19	 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we preached among you, Silvanus and Timothy and I, was not Yes and No; but in him it is always Yes. 
2CO.1.20	 For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. That is why we utter the Amen through him, to the glory of God. 
2CO.1.21	But it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has commissioned us; 
2CO.1.22	he has put his seal upon us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.
2CO.1.23	But I call God to witness against me—it was to spare you that I refrained from coming to Corinth. 
2CO.1.24	Not that we lord it over your faith; we work with you for your joy, for you stand firm in your faith.
2CO.2.1	For I made up my mind not to make you another painful visit. 
2CO.2.2	For if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained? 
2CO.2.3	And I wrote as I did, so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice, for I felt sure of all of you, that my joy would be the joy of you all. 
2CO.2.4	For I wrote you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you.
2CO.2.5	But if any one has caused pain, he has caused it not to me, but in some measure—not to put it too severely—to you all. 
2CO.2.6	For such a one this punishment by the majority is enough; 
2CO.2.7	so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him, or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. 
2CO.2.8	So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him. 
2CO.2.9	For this is why I wrote, that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything. 
2CO.2.10	Any one whom you forgive, I also forgive. What I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ, 
2CO.2.11	to keep Satan from gaining the advantage over us; for we are not ignorant of his designs.
2CO.2.13	but my mind could not rest because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took leave of them and went on to Macedonia.
2CO.2.14	But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumph, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere. 
2CO.2.15	For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing, 
2CO.2.16	to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things? 
2CO.2.17	For we are not, like so many, peddlers of God's word; but as men of sincerity, as commissioned by God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.
2CO.3.2	You yourselves are our letter of recommendation, written on your
2CO.3.3	 and you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.
2CO.3.4	Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God. 
2CO.3.5	Not that we are competent of ourselves to claim anything as coming from us; our competence is from God, 
2CO.3.6	 who has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant, not in a written code but in the Spirit; for the written code kills, but the Spirit gives life.
2CO.3.8	will not the dispensation of the Spirit be attended with greater splendor? 
2CO.3.9	For if there was splendor in the dispensation of condemnation, the dispensation of righteousness must far exceed it in splendor. 
2CO.3.10	Indeed, in this case, what once had splendor has come to have no splendor at all, because of the splendor that surpasses it. 
2CO.3.11	For if what faded away came with splendor, what is permanent must have much more splendor.
2CO.3.12	Since we have such a hope, we are very bold, 
2CO.3.13	not like Moses, who put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not see the end of the fading splendor. 
2CO.3.14	But their minds were hardened; for to this day, when they read the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it taken away. 
2CO.3.15	Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their minds; 
2CO.3.16	but when a man turns to the Lord the veil is removed. 
2CO.3.17	 Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. 
2CO.3.18	And we all, with unveiled face, beholding
2CO.4.1	Therefore, having this ministry by the mercy of God,
2CO.4.2	We have renounced disgraceful, underhanded ways; we refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with God's word, but by the open statement of the truth we would commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. 
2CO.4.3	And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled only to those who are perishing. 
2CO.4.4	 In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the likeness of God. 
2CO.4.5	For what we preach is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, with ourselves as your servants
2CO.4.6	 For it is the God who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.
2CO.4.7	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, to show that the transcendent power belongs to God and not to us. 
2CO.4.8	We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; 
2CO.4.9	persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; 
2CO.4.10	always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies. 
2CO.4.11	For while we live we are always being given up to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh. 
2CO.4.12	So death is at work in us, but life in you.
2CO.4.14	 knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence. 
2CO.4.15	For it is all for your sake, so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving, to the glory of God.
2CO.4.16	So we do not lose heart. Though our outer nature is wasting away, our inner nature is being renewed every day. 
2CO.4.17	For this slight momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, 
2CO.4.18	because we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen; for the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.
2CO.5.1	For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. 
2CO.5.2	Here indeed we groan, and long to put on our heavenly dwelling, 
2CO.5.3	so that by putting it on we may not be found naked. 
2CO.5.4	For while we are still in this tent, we sigh with anxiety; not that we would be unclothed, but that we would be further clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. 
2CO.5.5	He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee.
2CO.5.6	So we are always of good courage; we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord, 
2CO.5.7	for we walk by faith, not by sight. 
2CO.5.8	We are of good courage, and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord. 
2CO.5.9	So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him. 
2CO.5.10	 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive good or evil, according to what he has done in the body.
2CO.5.11	Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men; but what we are is known to God, and I hope it is known also to your conscience. 
2CO.5.12	 We are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you cause to be proud of us, so that you may be able to answer those who pride themselves on a man's position and not on his heart. 
2CO.5.13	For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you. 
2CO.5.14	 For the love of Christ controls us, because we are convinced that one has died for all; therefore all have died. 
2CO.5.15	And he died for all, that those who live might live no longer for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised.
2CO.5.16	From now on, therefore, we regard no one from a human point of view; even though we once regarded Christ from a human point of view, we regard him thus no longer. 
2CO.5.17	 Therefore, if any one is in Christ, he is a new creation;
2CO.5.18	 All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation; 
2CO.5.19	that is, in Christ God was reconciling
2CO.5.20	 So we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We beseech you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. 
2CO.5.21	 For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
2CO.6.1	Working together with him, then, we entreat you not to accept the grace of God in vain. 
2CO.6.2	 For he says,
2CO.6.2	“At the acceptable time I have listened to you,
2CO.6.2	and helped you on the day of salvation.”
2CO.6.2	Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation. 
2CO.6.3	We put no obstacle in any one's way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry, 
2CO.6.4	 but as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: through great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, calamities, 
2CO.6.5	 beatings, imprisonments, tumults, labors, watching, hunger; 
2CO.6.6	by purity, knowledge, forbearance, kindness, the Holy Spirit, genuine love, 
2CO.6.7	 truthful speech, and the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left; 
2CO.6.8	in honor and dishonor, in ill repute and good repute. We are treated as impostors, and yet are true; 
2CO.6.9	 as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold we live; as punished, and yet not killed; 
2CO.6.10	 as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing everything.
2CO.6.12	You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted in your own affections. 
2CO.6.13	In return—I speak as to children—widen your hearts also.
2CO.6.14	Do not be mismated with unbelievers. For what partnership have righteousness and iniquity? Or what fellowship has light with darkness? 
2CO.6.15	What accord has Christ with Belial?
2CO.6.16	 What agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; as God said,
2CO.6.16	“I will live in them and move among them,
2CO.6.16	and I will be their God,
2CO.6.16	and they shall be my people.
2CO.6.17	and be separate from them, says the Lord,
2CO.6.17	and touch nothing unclean;
2CO.6.17	then I will welcome you,
2CO.6.18	and you shall be my sons and daughters,
2CO.6.18	says the Lord Almighty.”
2CO.7.1	Since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit, and make holiness perfect in the fear of God.
2CO.7.3	 I do not say this to condemn you, for I said before that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together. 
2CO.7.4	I have great confidence in you; I have great pride in you; I am filled with comfort. With all our affliction, I am overjoyed.
2CO.7.6	 But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus, 
2CO.7.7	and not only by his coming but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, as he told us of your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced still more. 
2CO.7.8	 For even if I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it (though I did regret it), for I see that letter grieved you, though only for a while. 
2CO.7.9	As it is, I rejoice, not because you were grieved, but because you were grieved into repenting; for you felt a godly grief, so that you suffered no loss through us. 
2CO.7.10	For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation and brings no regret, but worldly grief produces death. 
2CO.7.11	For see what earnestness this godly grief has produced in you, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what zeal, what punishment! At every point you have proved yourselves guiltless in the matter. 
2CO.7.12	 So although I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did the wrong, nor on account of the one who suffered the wrong, but in order that your zeal for us might be revealed to you in the sight of God. 
2CO.7.13	Therefore we are comforted.
2CO.7.13	And besides our own comfort we rejoiced still more at the joy of Titus, because his mind has been set at rest by you all. 
2CO.7.14	For if I have expressed to him some pride in you, I was not put to shame; but just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting before Titus has proved true. 
2CO.7.15	And his heart goes out all the more to you, as he remembers the obedience of you all, and the fear and trembling with which you received him. 
2CO.7.16	I rejoice, because I have perfect confidence in you.
2CO.8.1	We want you to know, brethren, about the grace of God which has been shown in the churches of Macedonia, 
2CO.8.2	for in a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of liberality on their part. 
2CO.8.3	 For they gave according to their means, as I can testify, and beyond their means, of their own free will, 
2CO.8.4	 begging us earnestly for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints— 
2CO.8.5	and this, not as we expected, but first they gave themselves to the Lord and to us by the will of God. 
2CO.8.6	 Accordingly we have urged Titus that as he had already made a beginning, he should also complete among you this gracious work. 
2CO.8.7	Now as you excel in everything—in faith, in utterance, in knowledge, in all earnestness, and in your love for us—see that you excel in this gracious work also.
2CO.8.8	I say this not as a command, but to prove by the earnestness of others that your love also is genuine. 
2CO.8.9	 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that by his poverty you might become rich. 
2CO.8.10	 And in this matter I give my advice: it is best for you now to complete what a year ago you began not only to do but to desire, 
2CO.8.11	so that your readiness in desiring it may be matched by your completing it out of what you have. 
2CO.8.12	For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what a man has, not according to what he has not. 
2CO.8.13	I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened, 
2CO.8.14	but that as a matter of equality your abundance at the present time should supply their want, so that their abundance may supply your want, that there may be equality. 
2CO.8.15	 As it is written, “He who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack.”
2CO.8.16	But thanks be to God who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus. 
2CO.8.17	For he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself very earnest he is going to you of his own accord. 
2CO.8.18	 With him we are sending the brother who is famous among all the churches for his preaching of the gospel; 
2CO.8.19	 and not only that, but he has been appointed by the churches to travel with us in this gracious work which we are carrying on, for the glory of the Lord and to show our good will. 
2CO.8.20	We intend that no one should blame us about this liberal gift which we are administering, 
2CO.8.21	for we aim at what is honorable not only in the Lord's sight but also in the sight of men. 
2CO.8.22	And with them we are sending our brother whom we have often tested and found earnest in many matters, but who is now more earnest than ever because of his great confidence in you. 
2CO.8.23	As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker in your service; and as for our brethren, they are messengers
2CO.8.24	So give proof, before the churches, of your love and of our boasting about you to these men.
2CO.9.2	 for I know your readiness, of which I boast about you to the people of Macedonia, saying that Achaia has been ready since last year; and your zeal has stirred up most of them. 
2CO.9.3	 But I am sending the brethren so that our boasting about you may not prove vain in this case, so that you may be ready, as I said you would be; 
2CO.9.4	lest if some Macedonians come with me and find that you are not ready, we be humiliated—to say nothing of you—for being so confident. 
2CO.9.5	So I thought it necessary to urge the brethren to go on to you before me, and arrange in advance for this gift you have promised, so that it may be ready not as an exaction but as a willing gift.
2CO.9.6	The point is this: he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. 
2CO.9.7	 Each one must do as he has made up his mind, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. 
2CO.9.8	 And God is able to provide you with every blessing in abundance, so that you may always have enough of everything and may provide in abundance for every good work. 
2CO.9.9	 As it is written,
2CO.9.9	“He scatters abroad, he gives to the poor;
2CO.9.9	his righteousness
2CO.9.11	You will be enriched in every way for great generosity, which through us will produce thanksgiving to God; 
2CO.9.12	for the rendering of this service not only supplies the wants of the saints but also overflows in many thanksgivings to God. 
2CO.9.13	 Under the test of this service, you
2CO.9.14	while they long for you and pray for you, because of the surpassing grace of God in you. 
2CO.9.15	 Thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift!
2CO.10.2	 I beg of you that when I am present I may not have to show boldness with such confidence as I count on showing against some who suspect us of acting in worldly fashion. 
2CO.10.3	For though we live in the world we are not carrying on a worldly war, 
2CO.10.4	for the weapons of our warfare are not worldly but have divine power to destroy strongholds. 
2CO.10.5	We destroy arguments and every proud obstacle to the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ, 
2CO.10.6	 being ready to punish every disobedience, when your obedience is complete.
2CO.10.8	For even if I boast a little too much of our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I shall not be put to shame. 
2CO.10.9	I would not seem to be frightening you with letters. 
2CO.10.10	 For they say, “His letters are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account.” 
2CO.10.11	Let such people understand that what we say by letter when absent, we do when present. 
2CO.10.12	Not that we venture to class or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves. But when they measure themselves by one another, and compare themselves with one another, they are without understanding.
2CO.10.13	But we will not boast beyond limit, but will keep to the limits God has apportioned us, to reach even to you. 
2CO.10.14	For we are not overextending ourselves, as though we did not reach you; we were the first to come all the way to you with the gospel of Christ. 
2CO.10.15	 We do not boast beyond limit, in other men's labors; but our hope is that as your faith increases, our field among you may be greatly enlarged, 
2CO.10.16	so that we may preach the gospel in lands beyond you, without boasting of work already done in another's field. 
2CO.10.17	 “Let him who boasts, boast of the Lord.” 
2CO.10.18	For it is not the man who commends himself that is accepted, but the man whom the Lord commends.
2CO.11.2	 I feel a divine jealousy for you, for I betrothed you to Christ to present you as a pure bride to her one husband. 
2CO.11.3	 But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ. 
2CO.11.4	 For if some one comes and preaches another Jesus than the one we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted, you submit to it readily enough. 
2CO.11.5	 I think that I am not in the least inferior to these superlative apostles. 
2CO.11.6	 Even if I am unskilled in speaking, I am not in knowledge; in every way we have made this plain to you in all things.
2CO.11.8	 I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you. 
2CO.11.9	And when I was with you and was in want, I did not burden any one, for my needs were supplied by the brethren who came from Macedonia. So I refrained and will refrain from burdening you in any way. 
2CO.11.10	 As the truth of Christ is in me, this boast of mine shall not be silenced in the regions of Achaia. 
2CO.11.11	 And why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!
2CO.11.13	For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. 
2CO.11.14	And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. 
2CO.11.15	So it is not strange if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.
2CO.11.16	I repeat, let no one think me foolish; but even if you do, accept me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little. 
2CO.11.17	 (What I am saying I say not with the Lord's authority but as a fool, in this boastful confidence; 
2CO.11.18	since many boast of worldly things, I too will boast.) 
2CO.11.19	 For you gladly bear with fools, being wise yourselves! 
2CO.11.20	For you bear it if a man makes slaves of you, or preys upon you, or takes advantage of you, or puts on airs, or strikes you in the face. 
2CO.11.21	To my shame, I must say, we were too weak for that!
2CO.11.21	But whatever any one dares to boast of—I am speaking as a fool—I also dare to boast of that. 
2CO.11.22	Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I. 
2CO.11.23	 Are they servants of Christ? I am a better one—I am talking like a madman—with far greater labors, far more imprisonments, with countless beatings, and often near death. 
2CO.11.24	 Five times I have received at the hands of the Jews the forty lashes less one. 
2CO.11.25	 Three times I have been beaten with rods; once I was stoned. Three times I have been shipwrecked; a night and a day I have been adrift at sea; 
2CO.11.26	 on frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, danger from my own people, danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false brethren; 
2CO.11.27	 in toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure. 
2CO.11.28	And, apart from other things, there is the daily pressure upon me of my anxiety for all the churches. 
2CO.11.29	 Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to fall, and I am not indignant?
2CO.11.30	If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness. 
2CO.11.31	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed for ever, knows that I do not lie. 
2CO.11.32	 At Damascus, the governor under King Aretas guarded the city of Damascus in order to seize me, 
2CO.11.33	but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and escaped his hands.
2CO.12.1	I must boast; there is nothing to be gained by it, but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. 
2CO.12.2	I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows. 
2CO.12.3	And I know that this man was caught up into Paradise—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows— 
2CO.12.4	 and he heard things that cannot be told, which man may not utter. 
2CO.12.5	On behalf of this man I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except of my weaknesses. 
2CO.12.6	Though if I wish to boast, I shall not be a fool, for I shall be speaking the truth. But I refrain from it, so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me. 
2CO.12.7	 And to keep me from being too elated by the abundance of revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to harass me, to keep me from being too elated. 
2CO.12.8	Three times I besought the Lord about this, that it should leave me; 
2CO.12.9	but he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” I will all the more gladly boast of my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 
2CO.12.10	 For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities; for when I am weak, then I am strong.
2CO.12.12	The signs of a true apostle were performed among you in all patience, with signs and wonders and mighty works. 
2CO.12.13	 For in what were you less favored than the rest of the churches, except that I myself did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong!
2CO.12.14	Here for the third time I am ready to come to you. And I will not be a burden, for I seek not what is yours but you; for children ought not to lay up for their parents, but parents for their children. 
2CO.12.15	I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you the more, am I to be loved the less? 
2CO.12.16	 But granting that I myself did not burden you, I was crafty, you say, and got the better of you by guile. 
2CO.12.17	Did I take advantage of you through any of those whom I sent to you? 
2CO.12.18	 I urged Titus to go, and sent the brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not act in the same spirit? Did we not take the same steps?
2CO.12.19	Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves before you? It is in the sight of God that we have been speaking in Christ, and all for your upbuilding, beloved. 
2CO.12.20	 For I fear that perhaps I may come and find you not what I wish, and that you may find me not what you wish; that perhaps there may be quarreling, jealousy, anger, selfishness, slander, gossip, conceit, and disorder. 
2CO.12.21	I fear that when I come again my God may humble me before you, and I may have to mourn over many of those who sinned before and have not repented of the impurity, immorality, and licentiousness which they have practiced.
2CO.13.2	I warned those who sinned before and all the others, and I warn them now while absent, as I did when present on my second visit, that if I come again I will not spare them— 
2CO.13.3	since you desire proof that Christ is speaking in me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful in you. 
2CO.13.4	 For he was crucified in weakness, but lives by the power of God. For we are weak in him, but in dealing with you we shall live with him by the power of God.
2CO.13.5	Examine yourselves, to see whether you are holding to your faith. Test yourselves. Do you not realize that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless indeed you fail to meet the test! 
2CO.13.6	I hope you will find out that we have not failed. 
2CO.13.7	But we pray God that you may not do wrong—not that we may appear to have met the test, but that you may do what is right, though we may seem to have failed. 
2CO.13.8	For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth. 
2CO.13.9	For we are glad when we are weak and you are strong. What we pray for is your improvement. 
2CO.13.10	 I write this while I am away from you, in order that when I come I may not have to be severe in my use of the authority which the Lord has given me for building up and not for tearing down.
2CO.13.11	Finally, brethren, farewell. Mend your ways, heed my appeal, agree with one another, live in peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you. 
2CO.13.12	 Greet one another with a holy kiss. 
2CO.13.13	 All the saints greet you.
GAL.1.1	Paul an apostle—not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead— 
GAL.1.2	and all the brethren who are with me,
GAL.1.2	To the churches of Galatia:
GAL.1.4	 who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father; 
GAL.1.5	 to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
GAL.1.6	I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and turning to a different gospel— 
GAL.1.7	not that there is another gospel, but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. 
GAL.1.8	 But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to that which we preached to you, let him be accursed. 
GAL.1.9	As we have said before, so now I say again, If any one is preaching to you a gospel contrary to that which you received, let him be accursed.
GAL.1.12	For I did not receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came through a revelation of Jesus Christ. 
GAL.1.13	 For you have heard of my former life in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it; 
GAL.1.14	 and I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers. 
GAL.1.15	 But when he who had set me apart before I was born, and had called me through his grace, 
GAL.1.16	was pleased to reveal his Son to
GAL.1.17	nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned to Damascus.
GAL.1.19	But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord's brother. 
GAL.1.20	(In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie!) 
GAL.1.21	Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. 
GAL.1.22	And I was still not known by sight to the churches of Christ in Judea; 
GAL.1.23	they only heard it said, “He who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.” 
GAL.1.24	And they glorified God because of me.
GAL.2.2	I went up by revelation; and I laid before them (but privately before those who were of repute) the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, lest somehow I should be running or had run in vain. 
GAL.2.3	But even Titus, who was with me, was not compelled to be circumcised, though he was a Greek. 
GAL.2.4	But because of false brethren secretly brought in, who slipped in to spy out our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage— 
GAL.2.5	 to them we did not yield submission even for a moment, that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you. 
GAL.2.6	 And from those who were reputed to be something (what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)—those, I say, who were of repute added nothing to me; 
GAL.2.7	but on the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised 
GAL.2.8	(for he who worked through Peter for the mission to the circumcised worked through me also for the Gentiles), 
GAL.2.9	and when they perceived the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised; 
GAL.2.10	only they would have us remember the poor, which very thing I was eager to do.
GAL.2.12	For before certain men came from James, he ate with the Gentiles; but when they came he drew back and separated himself, fearing the circumcision party. 
GAL.2.13	And with him the rest of the Jews acted insincerely, so that even Barnabas was carried away by their insincerity. 
GAL.2.14	But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, “If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?” 
GAL.2.15	We ourselves, who are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners, 
GAL.2.16	 yet who know that a man is not justified
GAL.2.17	But if, in our endeavor to be justified in Christ, we ourselves were found to be sinners, is Christ then an agent of sin? Certainly not! 
GAL.2.18	But if I build up again those things which I tore down, then I prove myself a transgressor. 
GAL.2.19	For I through the law died to the law, that I might live to God. 
GAL.2.20	 I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me; and the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. 
GAL.2.21	I do not nullify the grace of God; for if justification
GAL.3.1	O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified? 
GAL.3.2	Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law, or by hearing with faith? 
GAL.3.3	Are you so foolish? Having begun with the Spirit, are you now ending with the flesh? 
GAL.3.4	Did you experience so many things in vain?—if it really is in vain. 
GAL.3.5	Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?
GAL.3.7	So you see that it is men of faith who are the sons of Abraham. 
GAL.3.8	 And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you shall all the nations be blessed.” 
GAL.3.9	 So then, those who are men of faith are blessed with Abraham who had faith.
GAL.3.11	 Now it is evident that no man is justified before God by the law; for “He who through faith is righteous shall live”;
GAL.3.12	 but the law does not rest on faith, for “He who does them shall live by them.” 
GAL.3.13	 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us—for it is written, “Cursed be every one who hangs on a tree” — 
GAL.3.14	that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
GAL.3.15	To give a human example, brethren: no one annuls even a man's will,
GAL.3.16	 Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, “And to offsprings,” referring to many; but, referring to one, “And to your offspring,” which is Christ. 
GAL.3.17	 This is what I mean: the law, which came four hundred and thirty years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void. 
GAL.3.18	 For if the inheritance is by the law, it is no longer by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise.
GAL.3.20	Now an intermediary implies more than one; but God is one.
GAL.3.22	 But the scripture consigned all things to sin, that what was promised to faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.
GAL.3.23	Now before faith came, we were confined under the law, kept under restraint until faith should be revealed. 
GAL.3.24	So that the law was our custodian until Christ came, that we might be justified by faith. 
GAL.3.25	But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a custodian; 
GAL.3.26	for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. 
GAL.3.27	For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 
GAL.3.28	 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 
GAL.3.29	And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise.
GAL.4.1	I mean that the heir, as long as he is a child, is no better than a slave, though he is the owner of all the estate; 
GAL.4.2	but he is under guardians and trustees until the date set by the father. 
GAL.4.3	 So with us; when we were children, we were slaves to the elemental spirits of the universe. 
GAL.4.4	But when the time had fully come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, 
GAL.4.5	to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. 
GAL.4.6	 And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba! Father!” 
GAL.4.7	So through God you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son then an heir.
GAL.4.8	Formerly, when you did not know God, you were in bondage to beings that by nature are no gods; 
GAL.4.9	but now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly elemental spirits, whose slaves you want to be once more? 
GAL.4.10	You observe days, and months, and seasons, and years! 
GAL.4.11	I am afraid I have labored over you in vain.
GAL.4.12	Brethren, I beseech you, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You did me no wrong; 
GAL.4.13	 you know it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached the gospel to you at first; 
GAL.4.14	and though my condition was a trial to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus. 
GAL.4.15	What has become of the satisfaction you felt? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me. 
GAL.4.16	Have I then become your enemy by telling you the truth?
GAL.4.17	They make much of you, but for no good purpose; they want to shut you out, that you may make much of them. 
GAL.4.18	For a good purpose it is always good to be made much of, and not only when I am present with you. 
GAL.4.19	 My little children, with whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you! 
GAL.4.20	I could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.
GAL.4.21	Tell me, you who desire to be under law, do you not hear the law? 
GAL.4.22	 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave and one by a free woman. 
GAL.4.23	 But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, the son of the free woman through promise. 
GAL.4.24	Now this is an allegory: these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar. 
GAL.4.25	Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia;
GAL.4.26	But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother. 
GAL.4.27	 For it is written,
GAL.4.27	“Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear;
GAL.4.27	break forth and shout, you who are not in travail;
GAL.4.27	for the children of the desolate one are many more
GAL.4.27	than the children of her that is married.”
GAL.4.28	Now we,
GAL.4.29	 But as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now. 
GAL.4.30	 But what does the scripture say? “Cast out the slave and her son; for the son of the slave shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.” 
GAL.4.31	So, brethren, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman.
GAL.5.1	For freedom Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.
GAL.5.2	Now I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you. 
GAL.5.3	I testify again to every man who receives circumcision that he is bound to keep the whole law. 
GAL.5.4	You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace. 
GAL.5.5	For through the Spirit, by faith, we wait for the hope of righteousness. 
GAL.5.6	 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any avail, but faith working
GAL.5.7	You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth? 
GAL.5.8	This persuasion is not from him who calls you. 
GAL.5.9	 A little leaven leavens the whole lump. 
GAL.5.10	I have confidence in the Lord that you will take no other view than mine; and he who is troubling you will bear his judgment, whoever he is. 
GAL.5.11	But if I, brethren, still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? In that case the stumbling block of the cross has been removed. 
GAL.5.12	I wish those who unsettle you would mutilate themselves!
GAL.5.13	For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love be servants of one another. 
GAL.5.14	 For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” 
GAL.5.15	But if you bite and devour one another take heed that you are not consumed by one another.
GAL.5.16	But I say, walk by the Spirit, and do not gratify the desires of the flesh. 
GAL.5.17	 For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, to prevent you from doing what you would. 
GAL.5.18	But if you are led by the Spirit you are not under the law. 
GAL.5.19	 Now the works of the flesh are plain: fornication, impurity, licentiousness, 
GAL.5.20	idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, anger, selfishness, dissension, party spirit, 
GAL.5.21	envy,
GAL.5.22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 
GAL.5.23	gentleness, self-control; against such there is no law. 
GAL.5.24	And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
GAL.5.25	If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. 
GAL.5.26	Let us have no self-conceit, no provoking of one another, no envy of one another.
GAL.6.1	Brethren, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Look to yourself, lest you too be tempted. 
GAL.6.2	Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. 
GAL.6.3	For if any one thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself. 
GAL.6.4	But let each one test his own work, and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor. 
GAL.6.5	For each man will have to bear his own load.
GAL.6.6	Let him who is taught the word share all good things with him who teaches.
GAL.6.7	Do not be deceived; God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. 
GAL.6.8	For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption; but he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. 
GAL.6.9	And let us not grow weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap, if we do not lose heart. 
GAL.6.10	So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all men, and especially to those who are of the household of faith.
GAL.6.12	It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh that would compel you to be circumcised, and only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. 
GAL.6.13	For even those who receive circumcision do not themselves keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh. 
GAL.6.14	But far be it from me to glory except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which
GAL.6.15	For neither circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. 
GAL.6.16	 Peace and mercy be upon all who walk by this rule, upon the Israel of God.
GAL.6.17	Henceforth let no man trouble me; for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.
GAL.6.18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.
EPH.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,
EPH.1.1	To the saints who are also faithful
EPH.1.2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
EPH.1.4	even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. 
EPH.1.5	He destined us in love
EPH.1.6	 to the praise of his glorious grace which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved. 
EPH.1.7	 In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace 
EPH.1.8	which he lavished upon us. 
EPH.1.9	For he has made known to us in all wisdom and insight the mystery of his will, according to his purpose which he set forth in Christ 
EPH.1.10	 as a plan for the fulness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth.
EPH.1.11	In him, according to the purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to the counsel of his will, 
EPH.1.12	we who first hoped in Christ have been destined and appointed to live for the praise of his glory. 
EPH.1.13	In him you also, who have heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and have believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, 
EPH.1.14	 which is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory.
EPH.1.16	 I do not cease to give thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers, 
EPH.1.17	that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him, 
EPH.1.18	 having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, that you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints, 
EPH.1.19	and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power in us who believe, according to the working of his great might 
EPH.1.20	 which he accomplished in Christ when he raised him from the dead and made him sit at his right hand in the heavenly places, 
EPH.1.21	 far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come; 
EPH.1.22	 and he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church, 
EPH.1.23	 which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all.
EPH.2.1	And you he made alive, when you were dead through the trespasses and sins 
EPH.2.2	 in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience. 
EPH.2.3	Among these we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, following the desires of body and mind, and so we were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. 
EPH.2.4	But God, who is rich in mercy, out of the great love with which he loved us, 
EPH.2.5	even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), 
EPH.2.6	and raised us up with him, and made us sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, 
EPH.2.7	that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. 
EPH.2.8	 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not your own doing, it is the gift of God— 
EPH.2.9	not because of works, lest any man should boast. 
EPH.2.10	For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.
EPH.2.11	Therefore remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh, called the uncircumcision by what is called the circumcision, which is made in the flesh by hands— 
EPH.2.12	 remember that you were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. 
EPH.2.13	But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near in the blood of Christ. 
EPH.2.14	For he is our peace, who has made us both one, and has broken down the dividing wall of hostility, 
EPH.2.15	by abolishing in his flesh the law of commandments and ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace, 
EPH.2.16	and might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby bringing the hostility to an end. 
EPH.2.17	 And he came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near; 
EPH.2.18	for through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father. 
EPH.2.19	So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, 
EPH.2.20	built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, 
EPH.2.21	in whom the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord; 
EPH.2.22	in whom you also are built into it for a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.
EPH.3.1	For this reason I, Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles— 
EPH.3.2	 assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace that was given to me for you, 
EPH.3.3	how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I have written briefly. 
EPH.3.4	When you read this you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ, 
EPH.3.5	which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; 
EPH.3.6	 that is, how the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
EPH.3.7	Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God's grace which was given me by the working of his power. 
EPH.3.8	To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, 
EPH.3.9	 and to make all men see what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in
EPH.3.10	that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places. 
EPH.3.11	This was according to the eternal purpose which he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, 
EPH.3.12	in whom we have boldness and confidence of access through our faith in him. 
EPH.3.13	So I ask you not to
EPH.3.14	For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, 
EPH.3.15	from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, 
EPH.3.16	that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with might through his Spirit in the inner man, 
EPH.3.17	and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, 
EPH.3.18	may have power to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, 
EPH.3.19	and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fulness of God.
EPH.3.20	Now to him who by the power at work within us is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, 
EPH.3.21	to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, for ever and ever. Amen.
EPH.4.1	I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, beg you to lead a life worthy of the calling to which you have been called, 
EPH.4.2	 with all lowliness and meekness, with patience, forbearing one another in love, 
EPH.4.3	eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 
EPH.4.4	There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call, 
EPH.4.5	one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 
EPH.4.6	one God and Father of us all, who is above all and through all and in all. 
EPH.4.7	But grace was given to each of us according to the measure of Christ's gift. 
EPH.4.8	 Therefore it is said,
EPH.4.8	“When he ascended on high he led a host of captives,
EPH.4.8	and he gave gifts to men.”
EPH.4.9	(In saying, “He ascended,” what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth? 
EPH.4.10	He who descended is he who also ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.) 
EPH.4.11	And his gifts were that some should be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, 
EPH.4.12	to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, 
EPH.4.13	until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ; 
EPH.4.14	so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the cunning of men, by their craftiness in deceitful wiles. 
EPH.4.15	 Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, 
EPH.4.16	 from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by every joint with which it is supplied, when each part is working properly, makes bodily growth and upbuilds itself in love.
EPH.4.17	Now this I affirm and testify in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their minds; 
EPH.4.18	they are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to their hardness of heart; 
EPH.4.19	they have become callous and have given themselves up to licentiousness, greedy to practice every kind of uncleanness. 
EPH.4.20	You did not so learn Christ! — 
EPH.4.21	assuming that you have heard about him and were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus. 
EPH.4.22	Put off your old nature which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful lusts, 
EPH.4.23	and be renewed in the spirit of your minds, 
EPH.4.24	and put on the new nature, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.
EPH.4.26	Be angry but do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, 
EPH.4.27	and give no opportunity to the devil. 
EPH.4.28	Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing honest work with his hands, so that he may be able to give to those in need. 
EPH.4.29	Let no evil talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for edifying, as fits the occasion, that it may impart grace to those who hear. 
EPH.4.30	And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. 
EPH.4.31	Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, with all malice, 
EPH.4.32	and be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.
EPH.5.1	Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children. 
EPH.5.2	 And walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
EPH.5.3	But fornication and all impurity or covetousness must not even be named among you, as is fitting among saints. 
EPH.5.4	Let there be no filthiness, nor silly talk, nor levity, which are not fitting; but instead let there be thanksgiving. 
EPH.5.5	Be sure of this, that no fornicator or impure man, or one who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. 
EPH.5.6	Let no one deceive you with empty words, for it is because of these things that the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. 
EPH.5.7	Therefore do not associate with them, 
EPH.5.8	for once you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of light 
EPH.5.9	(for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true), 
EPH.5.10	and try to learn what is pleasing to the Lord. 
EPH.5.11	Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them. 
EPH.5.12	For it is a shame even to speak of the things that they do in secret; 
EPH.5.13	but when anything is exposed by the light it becomes visible, for anything that becomes visible is light. 
EPH.5.14	Therefore it is said,
EPH.5.14	“Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead,
EPH.5.14	and Christ shall give you light.”
EPH.5.15	Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise, 
EPH.5.16	 making the most of the time, because the days are evil. 
EPH.5.17	Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. 
EPH.5.18	And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit, 
EPH.5.19	 addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with all your heart, 
EPH.5.20	always and for everything giving thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father.
EPH.5.21	Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ. 
EPH.5.22	 Wives, be subject to your husbands, as to the Lord. 
EPH.5.23	For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. 
EPH.5.24	As the church is subject to Christ, so let wives also be subject in everything to their husbands. 
EPH.5.25	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, 
EPH.5.26	that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, 
EPH.5.27	that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. 
EPH.5.28	Even so husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 
EPH.5.29	For no man ever hates his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, as Christ does the church, 
EPH.5.30	because we are members of his body. 
EPH.5.31	 “For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” 
EPH.5.32	This mystery is a profound one, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church; 
EPH.5.33	however, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.
EPH.6.1	Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 
EPH.6.2	 “Honor your father and mother” (this is the first commandment with a promise), 
EPH.6.3	 “that it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth.” 
EPH.6.4	Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
EPH.6.5	Slaves, be obedient to those who are your earthly masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness of heart, as to Christ; 
EPH.6.6	not in the way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as servants
EPH.6.7	rendering service with a good will as to the Lord and not to men, 
EPH.6.8	knowing that whatever good any one does, he will receive the same again from the Lord, whether he is a slave or free. 
EPH.6.9	Masters, do the same to them, and forbear threatening, knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and that there is no partiality with him.
EPH.6.10	Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. 
EPH.6.11	Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 
EPH.6.12	For we are not contending against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world rulers of this present darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. 
EPH.6.13	Therefore take the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. 
EPH.6.14	 Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, 
EPH.6.15	 and having shod your feet with the equipment of the gospel of peace; 
EPH.6.16	besides all these, taking the shield of faith, with which you can quench all the flaming darts of the evil one. 
EPH.6.17	And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. 
EPH.6.18	Pray at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints, 
EPH.6.19	and also for me, that utterance may be given me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel, 
EPH.6.20	for which I am an ambassador in chains; that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak.
EPH.6.22	I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are, and that he may encourage your hearts.
EPH.6.23	Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
EPH.6.24	Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with love undying.
PHP.1.1	To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the bishops
PHP.1.3	I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, 
PHP.1.4	always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy, 
PHP.1.5	thankful for your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now. 
PHP.1.6	 And I am sure that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ. 
PHP.1.7	 It is right for me to feel thus about you all, because I hold you in my heart, for you are all partakers with me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel. 
PHP.1.8	For God is my witness, how I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus. 
PHP.1.9	And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, 
PHP.1.10	so that you may approve what is excellent, and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, 
PHP.1.11	filled with the fruits of righteousness which come through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
PHP.1.13	 so that it has become known throughout the whole praetorian guard
PHP.1.14	and most of the brethren have been made confident in the Lord because of my imprisonment, and are much more bold to speak the word of God without fear.
PHP.1.15	Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will. 
PHP.1.16	The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel; 
PHP.1.17	the former proclaim Christ out of partisanship, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment. 
PHP.1.18	What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in that I rejoice.
PHP.1.20	 as it is my eager expectation and hope that I shall not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death. 
PHP.1.21	 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. 
PHP.1.22	If it is to be life in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. 
PHP.1.23	I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. 
PHP.1.24	But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. 
PHP.1.25	Convinced of this, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith, 
PHP.1.26	so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again.
PHP.1.27	Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you that you stand firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel, 
PHP.1.28	 and not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is a clear omen to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God. 
PHP.1.29	For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake, 
PHP.1.30	 engaged in the same conflict which you saw and now hear to be mine.
PHP.2.2	complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. 
PHP.2.3	 Do nothing from selfishness or conceit, but in humility count others better than yourselves. 
PHP.2.4	Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. 
PHP.2.5	 Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, 
PHP.2.6	who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, 
PHP.2.7	but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant,
PHP.2.8	And being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross. 
PHP.2.9	 Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name, 
PHP.2.10	that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, 
PHP.2.11	and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
PHP.2.12	Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; 
PHP.2.13	 for God is at work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.
PHP.2.14	Do all things without grumbling or questioning, 
PHP.2.15	 that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, 
PHP.2.16	holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. 
PHP.2.17	Even if I am to be poured as a libation upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all. 
PHP.2.18	Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me.
PHP.2.19	I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I may be cheered by news of you. 
PHP.2.20	I have no one like him, who will be genuinely anxious for your welfare. 
PHP.2.21	They all look after their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. 
PHP.2.22	But Timothy's worth you know, how as a son with a father he has served with me in the gospel. 
PHP.2.23	I hope therefore to send him just as soon as I see how it will go with me; 
PHP.2.24	and I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself shall come also.
PHP.2.25	I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need, 
PHP.2.26	for he has been longing for you all, and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill. 
PHP.2.27	Indeed he was ill, near to death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. 
PHP.2.28	I am the more eager to send him, therefore, that you may rejoice at seeing him again, and that I may be less anxious. 
PHP.2.29	So receive him in the Lord with all joy; and honor such men, 
PHP.2.30	for he nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete your service to me.
PHP.3.1	Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is not irksome to me, and is safe for you.
PHP.3.2	Look out for the dogs, look out for the evil-workers, look out for those who mutilate the flesh. 
PHP.3.3	 For we are the true circumcision, who worship God in spirit,
PHP.3.4	 Though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also. If any other man thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more: 
PHP.3.5	circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law a Pharisee, 
PHP.3.6	as to zeal a persecutor of the church, as to righteousness under the law blameless. 
PHP.3.7	But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. 
PHP.3.8	Indeed I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as refuse, in order that I may gain Christ 
PHP.3.9	and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own, based on law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith; 
PHP.3.10	that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, 
PHP.3.11	that if possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.
PHP.3.12	Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect; but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. 
PHP.3.13	Brethren, I do not consider that I have made it my own; but one thing I do, forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, 
PHP.3.14	I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. 
PHP.3.15	Let those of us who are mature be thus minded; and if in anything you are otherwise minded, God will reveal that also to you. 
PHP.3.16	Only let us hold true to what we have attained.
PHP.3.18	For many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, live as enemies of the cross of Christ. 
PHP.3.19	Their end is destruction, their god is the belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things. 
PHP.3.20	But our commonwealth is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, 
PHP.3.21	 who will change our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power which enables him even to subject all things to himself.
PHP.4.1	Therefore, my brethren, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm thus in the Lord, my beloved.
PHP.4.2	I entreat Eu-odia and I entreat Syntyche to agree in the Lord. 
PHP.4.3	 And I ask you also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they have labored side by side with me in the gospel together with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.
PHP.4.4	Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice. 
PHP.4.5	Let all men know your forbearance. The Lord is at hand. 
PHP.4.6	 Have no anxiety about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. 
PHP.4.7	And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, will keep your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
PHP.4.8	Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is gracious, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. 
PHP.4.9	 What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, do; and the God of peace will be with you.
PHP.4.11	Not that I complain of want; for I have learned, in whatever state I am, to be content. 
PHP.4.12	I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in any and all circumstances I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and want. 
PHP.4.13	 I can do all things in him who strengthens me.
PHP.4.14	Yet it was kind of you to share my trouble. 
PHP.4.15	And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving except you only; 
PHP.4.16	 for even in Thessalonica you sent me help
PHP.4.17	Not that I seek the gift; but I seek the fruit which increases to your credit. 
PHP.4.18	I have received full payment, and more; I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God. 
PHP.4.19	And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. 
PHP.4.20	To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
PHP.4.21	Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me greet you. 
PHP.4.22	All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar's household.
COL.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
COL.1.2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father.
COL.1.4	because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which you have for all the saints, 
COL.1.5	because of the hope laid up for you in heaven. Of this you have heard before in the word of the truth, the gospel 
COL.1.6	which has come to you, as indeed in the whole world it is bearing fruit and growing—so among yourselves, from the day you heard and understood the grace of God in truth, 
COL.1.7	 as you learned it from Epaphras our beloved fellow servant. He is a faithful minister of Christ on our
COL.1.8	and has made known to us your love in the Spirit.
COL.1.10	to lead a life worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God. 
COL.1.11	May you be strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, for all endurance and patience with joy, 
COL.1.12	giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us
COL.1.13	 He has delivered us from the dominion of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, 
COL.1.14	in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
COL.1.16	for in him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or authorities—all things were created through him and for him. 
COL.1.17	 He is before all things, and in him all things hold together. 
COL.1.18	 He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the first-born from the dead, that in everything he might be pre-eminent. 
COL.1.19	For in him all the fulness of God was pleased to dwell, 
COL.1.20	and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross.
COL.1.21	And you, who once were estranged and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds, 
COL.1.22	he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death, in order to present you holy and blameless and irreproachable before him, 
COL.1.23	provided that you continue in the faith, stable and steadfast, not shifting from the hope of the gospel which you heard, which has been preached to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, became a minister.
COL.1.24	Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I complete what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church, 
COL.1.25	 of which I became a minister according to the divine office which was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known, 
COL.1.26	 the mystery hidden for ages and generations
COL.1.27	To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. 
COL.1.28	Him we proclaim, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man mature in Christ. 
COL.1.29	For this I toil, striving with all the energy which he mightily inspires within me.
COL.2.1	For I want you to know how greatly I strive for you, and for those at La-odicea, and for all who have not seen my face, 
COL.2.2	that their hearts may be encouraged as they are knit together in love, to have all the riches of assured understanding and the knowledge of God's mystery, of Christ, 
COL.2.3	 in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. 
COL.2.4	I say this in order that no one may delude you with beguiling speech. 
COL.2.5	For though I am absent in body, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good order and the firmness of your faith in Christ.
COL.2.6	As therefore you received Christ Jesus the Lord, so live in him, 
COL.2.7	rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.
COL.2.8	See to it that no one makes a prey of you by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the universe, and not according to Christ. 
COL.2.9	For in him the whole fulness of deity dwells bodily, 
COL.2.10	 and you have come to fulness of life in him, who is the head of all rule and authority. 
COL.2.11	In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of flesh in the circumcision of Christ; 
COL.2.12	and you were buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead. 
COL.2.13	And you, who were dead in trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, 
COL.2.14	having canceled the bond which stood against us with its legal demands; this he set aside, nailing it to the cross. 
COL.2.15	 He disarmed the principalities and powers and made a public example of them, triumphing over them in him.
COL.2.17	 These are only a shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ. 
COL.2.18	Let no one disqualify you, insisting on self-abasement and worship of angels, taking his stand on visions, puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind, 
COL.2.19	 and not holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.
COL.2.21	“Do not handle, Do not taste, Do not touch” 
COL.2.22	 (referring to things which all perish as they are used), according to human precepts and doctrines? 
COL.2.23	These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting rigor of devotion and self-abasement and severity to the body, but they are of no value in checking the indulgence of the flesh.
COL.3.2	Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. 
COL.3.3	For you have died, and your life is hid with Christ in God. 
COL.3.4	When Christ who is our life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.
COL.3.5	Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: fornication, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. 
COL.3.6	On account of these the wrath of God is coming.
COL.3.7	In these you once walked, when you lived in them. 
COL.3.8	But now put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and foul talk from your mouth. 
COL.3.9	Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old nature with its practices 
COL.3.10	 and have put on the new nature, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator. 
COL.3.11	Here there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all, and in all.
COL.3.13	forbearing one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. 
COL.3.14	And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. 
COL.3.15	And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in the one body. And be thankful. 
COL.3.16	 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teach and admonish one another in all wisdom, and sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts to God. 
COL.3.17	And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
COL.3.19	Husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them. 
COL.3.20	Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord. 
COL.3.21	Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged. 
COL.3.22	Slaves, obey in everything those who are your earthly masters, not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord. 
COL.3.23	 Whatever your task, work heartily, as serving the Lord and not men, 
COL.3.24	knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward; you are serving the Lord Christ. 
COL.3.25	For the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality.
COL.4.3	and pray for us also, that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ, on account of which I am in prison, 
COL.4.4	that I may make it clear, as I ought to speak.
COL.4.6	Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer every one.
COL.4.8	I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are and that he may encourage your hearts, 
COL.4.9	 and with him Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of yourselves. They will tell you of everything that has taken place here.
COL.4.11	and Jesus who is called Justus. These are the only men of the circumcision among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me. 
COL.4.12	 Epaphras, who is one of yourselves, a servant
COL.4.13	For I bear him witness that he has worked hard for you and for those in La-odicea and in Hi-erapolis. 
COL.4.14	 Luke the beloved physician and Demas greet you. 
COL.4.15	Give my greetings to the brethren at La-odicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house. 
COL.4.16	And when this letter has been read among you, have it read also in the church of the La-odiceans; and see that you read also the letter from La-odicea. 
COL.4.17	And say to Archippus, “See that you fulfil the ministry which you have received in the Lord.”
1TH.1.1	Grace to you and peace.
1TH.1.3	 remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. 
1TH.1.4	 For we know, brethren beloved by God, that he has chosen you; 
1TH.1.5	 for our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction. You know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake. 
1TH.1.6	 And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, for you received the word in much affliction, with joy inspired by the Holy Spirit; 
1TH.1.7	 so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia. 
1TH.1.8	 For not only has the word of the Lord sounded forth from you in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith in God has gone forth everywhere, so that we need not say anything. 
1TH.1.9	For they themselves report concerning us what a welcome we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols, to serve a living and true God, 
1TH.1.10	 and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.
1TH.2.1	For you yourselves know, brethren, that our visit to you was not in vain; 
1TH.2.2	 but though we had already suffered and been shamefully treated at Philippi, as you know, we had courage in our God to declare to you the gospel of God in the face of great opposition. 
1TH.2.3	For our appeal does not spring from error or uncleanness, nor is it made with guile; 
1TH.2.4	but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not to please men, but to please God who tests our hearts. 
1TH.2.5	 For we never used either words of flattery, as you know, or a cloak for greed, as God is witness; 
1TH.2.6	 nor did we seek glory from men, whether from you or from others, though we might have made demands as apostles of Christ. 
1TH.2.7	 But we were gentle
1TH.2.8	 So, being affectionately desirous of you, we were ready to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own selves, because you had become very dear to us.
1TH.2.9	For you remember our labor and toil, brethren; we worked night and day, that we might not burden any of you, while we preached to you the gospel of God. 
1TH.2.10	You are witnesses, and God also, how holy and righteous and blameless was our behavior to you believers; 
1TH.2.11	 for you know how, like a father with his children, we exhorted each one of you and encouraged you and charged you 
1TH.2.12	 to lead a life worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.
1TH.2.14	 For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus which are in Judea; for you suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they did from the Jews, 
1TH.2.15	 who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out, and displease God and oppose all men 
1TH.2.16	 by hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles that they may be saved—so as always to fill up the measure of their sins. But God's wrath has come upon them at last!
1TH.2.18	because we wanted to come to you—I, Paul, again and again—but Satan hindered us. 
1TH.2.19	 For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you? 
1TH.2.20	 For you are our glory and joy.
1TH.3.2	 and we sent Timothy, our brother and God's servant in the gospel of Christ, to establish you in your faith and to exhort you, 
1TH.3.3	 that no one be moved by these afflictions. You yourselves know that this is to be our lot. 
1TH.3.4	 For when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we were to suffer affliction; just as it has come to pass, and as you know. 
1TH.3.5	 For this reason, when I could bear it no longer, I sent that I might know your faith, for fear that somehow the tempter had tempted you and that our labor would be in vain.
1TH.3.7	for this reason, brethren, in all our distress and affliction we have been comforted about you through your faith; 
1TH.3.8	for now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord. 
1TH.3.9	For what thanksgiving can we render to God for you, for all the joy which we feel for your sake before our God, 
1TH.3.10	praying earnestly night and day that we may see you face to face and supply what is lacking in your faith?
1TH.3.11	Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you; 
1TH.3.12	and may the Lord make you increase and abound in love to one another and to all men, as we do to you, 
1TH.3.13	 so that he may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.
1TH.4.1	Finally, brethren, we beseech and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that as you learned from us how you ought to live and to please God, just as you are doing, you do so more and more. 
1TH.4.2	For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus. 
1TH.4.3	 For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from unchastity; 
1TH.4.4	 that each one of you know how to take a wife for himself
1TH.4.5	not in the passion of lust like heathen who do not know God; 
1TH.4.6	that no man transgress, and wrong his brother in this matter,
1TH.4.7	For God has not called us for uncleanness, but in holiness. 
1TH.4.8	Therefore whoever disregards this, disregards not man but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you.
1TH.4.9	But concerning love of the brethren you have no need to have any one write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another; 
1TH.4.10	and indeed you do love all the brethren throughout Macedonia. But we exhort you, brethren, to do so more and more, 
1TH.4.11	 to aspire to live quietly, to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands, as we charged you; 
1TH.4.12	so that you may command the respect of outsiders, and be dependent on nobody.
1TH.4.14	 For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep. 
1TH.4.15	For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, shall not precede those who have fallen asleep. 
1TH.4.16	 For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the archangel's call, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first; 
1TH.4.17	then we who are alive, who are left, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so we shall always be with the Lord. 
1TH.4.18	Therefore comfort one another with these words.
1TH.5.2	 For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. 
1TH.5.3	 When people say, “There is peace and security,” then sudden destruction will come upon them as travail comes upon a woman with child, and there will be no escape. 
1TH.5.4	 But you are not in darkness, brethren, for that day to surprise you like a thief. 
1TH.5.5	 For you are all sons of light and sons of the day; we are not of the night or of darkness. 
1TH.5.6	 So then let us not sleep, as others do, but let us keep awake and be sober. 
1TH.5.7	 For those who sleep at night, and those who get drunk are drunk at night. 
1TH.5.8	 But, since we belong to the day, let us be sober, and put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation. 
1TH.5.9	 For God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
1TH.5.10	who died for us so that whether we wake or sleep we might live with him. 
1TH.5.11	Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing.
1TH.5.13	 and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves. 
1TH.5.14	 And we exhort you, brethren, admonish the idlers, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with them all. 
1TH.5.15	 See that none of you repays evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to all. 
1TH.5.16	 Rejoice always, 
1TH.5.17	 pray constantly, 
1TH.5.18	 give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. 
1TH.5.19	 Do not quench the Spirit, 
1TH.5.20	 do not despise prophesying, 
1TH.5.21	 but test everything; hold fast what is good, 
1TH.5.22	abstain from every form of evil.
1TH.5.24	He who calls you is faithful, and he will do it.
1TH.5.25	Brethren, pray for us.
2TH.1.1	To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
2TH.1.4	Therefore we ourselves boast of you in the churches of God for your steadfastness and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which you are enduring.
2TH.1.5	This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be made worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are suffering— 
2TH.1.6	since indeed God deems it just to repay with affliction those who afflict you, 
2TH.1.7	and to grant rest with us to you who are afflicted, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, 
2TH.1.8	 inflicting vengeance upon those who do not know God and upon those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. 
2TH.1.9	They shall suffer the punishment of eternal destruction and exclusion from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might, 
2TH.1.10	when he comes on that day to be glorified in his saints, and to be marveled at in all who have believed, because our testimony to you was believed. 
2TH.1.11	 To this end we always pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of his call, and may fulfil every good resolve and work of faith by his power, 
2TH.1.12	so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.2.2	 not to be quickly shaken in mind or excited, either by spirit or by word, or by letter purporting to be from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come. 
2TH.2.3	 Let no one deceive you in any way; for that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness
2TH.2.4	 who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God. 
2TH.2.5	 Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you this? 
2TH.2.6	And you know what is restraining him now so that he may be revealed in his time. 
2TH.2.7	For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way. 
2TH.2.8	 And then the lawless one will be revealed, and the Lord Jesus will slay him with the breath of his mouth and destroy him by his appearing and his coming. 
2TH.2.9	 The coming of the lawless one by the activity of Satan will be with all power and with pretended signs and wonders, 
2TH.2.10	and with all wicked deception for those who are to perish, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. 
2TH.2.11	 Therefore God sends upon them a strong delusion, to make them believe what is false, 
2TH.2.12	so that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
2TH.2.14	To this he called you through our gospel, so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
2TH.2.15	 So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught by us, either by word of mouth or by letter.
2TH.2.17	comfort your hearts and establish them in every good work and word.
2TH.3.2	 and that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men; for not all have faith. 
2TH.3.3	 But the Lord is faithful; he will strengthen you and guard you from evil.
2TH.3.4	And we have confidence in the Lord about you, that you are doing and will do the things which we command. 
2TH.3.5	May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the steadfastness of Christ.
2TH.3.7	 For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us; we were not idle when we were with you, 
2TH.3.8	 we did not eat any one's bread without paying, but with toil and labor we worked night and day, that we might not burden any of you. 
2TH.3.9	 It was not because we have not that right, but to give you in our conduct an example to imitate. 
2TH.3.10	 For even when we were with you, we gave you this command: If any one will not work, let him not eat. 
2TH.3.11	 For we hear that some of you are living in idleness, mere busybodies, not doing any work. 
2TH.3.12	 Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work in quietness and to earn their own living. 
2TH.3.13	 Brethren, do not be weary in well-doing.
2TH.3.14	If any one refuses to obey what we say in this letter, note that man, and have nothing to do with him, that he may be ashamed. 
2TH.3.15	Do not look on him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.
2TH.3.18	 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
1TI.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,
1TI.1.2	To Timothy, my true child in the faith:
1TI.1.2	Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
1TI.1.3	As I urged you when I was going to Macedonia, remain at Ephesus that you may charge certain persons not to teach any different doctrine, 
1TI.1.4	nor to occupy themselves with myths and endless genealogies which promote speculations rather than the divine training
1TI.1.5	whereas the aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith. 
1TI.1.6	Certain persons by swerving from these have wandered away into vain discussion, 
1TI.1.7	desiring to be teachers of the law, without understanding either what they are saying or the things about which they make assertions.
1TI.1.8	Now we know that the law is good, if any one uses it lawfully, 
1TI.1.9	understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, 
1TI.1.10	immoral persons, sodomites, kidnapers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine, 
1TI.1.11	in accordance with the glorious gospel of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted.
1TI.1.12	I thank him who has given me strength for this, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he judged me faithful by appointing me to his service, 
1TI.1.13	though I formerly blasphemed and persecuted and insulted him; but I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief, 
1TI.1.14	and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. 
1TI.1.15	The saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. And I am the foremost of sinners; 
1TI.1.16	but I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience for an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life. 
1TI.1.17	To the King of ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever.
1TI.1.18	This charge I commit to you, Timothy, my son, in accordance with the prophetic utterances which pointed to you, that inspired by them you may wage the good warfare, 
1TI.1.19	holding faith and a good conscience. By rejecting conscience, certain persons have made shipwreck of their faith, 
1TI.1.20	among them Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme.
1TI.2.1	First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men, 
1TI.2.2	for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, godly and respectful in every way. 
1TI.2.3	This is good, and it is acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, 
1TI.2.4	who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. 
1TI.2.5	For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, 
1TI.2.6	who gave himself as a ransom for all, the testimony to which was borne at the proper time. 
1TI.2.7	For this I was appointed a preacher and apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
1TI.2.8	I desire then that in every place the men should pray, lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling; 
1TI.2.9	also that women should adorn themselves modestly and sensibly in seemly apparel, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly attire 
1TI.2.10	but by good deeds, as befits women who profess religion. 
1TI.2.11	Let a woman learn in silence with all submissiveness. 
1TI.2.12	I permit no woman to teach or to have authority over men; she is to keep silent. 
1TI.2.13	 For Adam was formed first, then Eve; 
1TI.2.14	 and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor. 
1TI.2.15	Yet woman will be saved through bearing children,
1TI.3.1	The saying is sure: If any one aspires to the office of bishop, he desires a noble task. 
1TI.3.2	Now a bishop must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, dignified, hospitable, an apt teacher, 
1TI.3.3	no drunkard, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, and no lover of money. 
1TI.3.4	He must manage his own household well, keeping his children submissive and respectful in every way; 
1TI.3.5	for if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how can he care for God's church? 
1TI.3.6	He must not be a recent convert, or he may be puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil;
1TI.3.7	moreover he must be well thought of by outsiders, or he may fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
1TI.3.8	Deacons likewise must be serious, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for gain; 
1TI.3.9	they must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience. 
1TI.3.10	And let them also be tested first; then if they prove themselves blameless let them serve as deacons. 
1TI.3.11	The women likewise must be serious, no slanderers, but temperate, faithful in all things. 
1TI.3.12	Let deacons be the husband of one wife, and let them manage their children and their households well; 
1TI.3.13	for those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and also great confidence in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
1TI.3.14	I hope to come to you soon, but I am writing these instructions to you so that, 
1TI.3.15	if I am delayed, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and bulwark of the truth. 
1TI.3.16	Great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of our religion:
1TI.3.16	He
1TI.3.16	vindicated
1TI.3.16	seen by angels,
1TI.3.16	preached among the nations,
1TI.3.16	believed on in the world,
1TI.3.16	taken up in glory.
1TI.4.1	Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by giving heed to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons, 
1TI.4.2	through the pretensions of liars whose consciences are seared, 
1TI.4.3	who forbid marriage and enjoin abstinence from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. 
1TI.4.4	For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving; 
1TI.4.5	for then it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer.
1TI.4.6	If you put these instructions before the brethren, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished on the words of the faith and of the good doctrine which you have followed. 
1TI.4.7	Have nothing to do with godless and silly myths. Train yourself in godliness; 
1TI.4.8	for while bodily training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way, as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come. 
1TI.4.9	The saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance. 
1TI.4.10	For to this end we toil and strive,
1TI.4.11	Command and teach these things. 
1TI.4.12	Let no one despise your youth, but set the believers an example in speech and conduct, in love, in faith, in purity. 
1TI.4.13	Till I come, attend to the public reading of scripture, to preaching, to teaching. 
1TI.4.14	Do not neglect the gift you have, which was given you by prophetic utterance when the council of elders laid their hands upon you. 
1TI.4.15	Practice these duties, devote yourself to them, so that all may see your progress. 
1TI.4.16	Take heed to yourself and to your teaching; hold to that, for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers.
1TI.5.1	Do not rebuke an older man but exhort him as you would a father; treat younger men like brothers, 
1TI.5.2	older women like mothers, younger women like sisters, in all purity.
1TI.5.3	Honor widows who are real widows. 
1TI.5.4	If a widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn their religious duty to their own family and make some return to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God. 
1TI.5.5	She who is a real widow, and is left all alone, has set her hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day; 
1TI.5.6	whereas she who is self-indulgent is dead even while she lives. 
1TI.5.7	Command this, so that they may be without reproach. 
1TI.5.8	If any one does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his own family, he has disowned the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
1TI.5.9	Let a widow be enrolled if she is not less than sixty years of age, having been the wife of one husband; 
1TI.5.10	and she must be well attested for her good deeds, as one who has brought up children, shown hospitality, washed the feet of the saints, relieved the afflicted, and devoted herself to doing good in every way. 
1TI.5.11	But refuse to enrol younger widows; for when they grow wanton against Christ they desire to marry, 
1TI.5.12	and so they incur condemnation for having violated their first pledge. 
1TI.5.13	Besides that, they learn to be idlers, gadding about from house to house, and not only idlers but gossips and busybodies, saying what they should not. 
1TI.5.14	So I would have younger widows marry, bear children, rule their households, and give the enemy no occasion to revile us. 
1TI.5.15	For some have already strayed after Satan. 
1TI.5.16	If any believing woman
1TI.5.17	Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching; 
1TI.5.18	 for the scripture says, “You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the grain,” and, “The laborer deserves his wages.” 
1TI.5.19	 Never admit any charge against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses. 
1TI.5.20	As for those who persist in sin, rebuke them in the presence of all, so that the rest may stand in fear. 
1TI.5.21	In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels I charge you to keep these rules without favor, doing nothing from partiality. 
1TI.5.22	Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, nor participate in another man's sins; keep yourself pure.
1TI.5.23	No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.
1TI.5.24	The sins of some men are conspicuous, pointing to judgment, but the sins of others appear later. 
1TI.5.25	So also good deeds are conspicuous; and even when they are not, they cannot remain hidden.
1TI.6.1	Let all who are under the yoke of slavery regard their masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may not be defamed. 
1TI.6.2	Those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful on the ground that they are brethren; rather they must serve all the better since those who benefit by their service are believers and beloved.
1TI.6.2	Teach and urge these duties. 
1TI.6.3	If any one teaches otherwise and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching which accords with godliness, 
1TI.6.4	he is puffed up with conceit, he knows nothing; he has a morbid craving for controversy and for disputes about words, which produce envy, dissension, slander, base suspicions, 
1TI.6.5	and wrangling among men who are depraved in mind and bereft of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain. 
1TI.6.6	There is great gain in godliness with contentment; 
1TI.6.7	for we brought nothing into the world, and
1TI.6.8	but if we have food and clothing, with these we shall be content. 
1TI.6.9	But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and hurtful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction. 
1TI.6.10	For the love of money is the root of all evils; it is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced their hearts with many pangs.
1TI.6.11	But as for you, man of God, shun all this; aim at righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness. 
1TI.6.12	Fight the good fight of the faith; take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. 
1TI.6.13	 In the presence of God who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus who in his testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, 
1TI.6.14	I charge you to keep the commandment unstained and free from reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ; 
1TI.6.15	and this will be made manifest at the proper time by the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, 
1TI.6.16	who alone has immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has ever seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.
1TI.6.17	As for the rich in this world, charge them not to be haughty, nor to set their hopes on uncertain riches but on God who richly furnishes us with everything to enjoy. 
1TI.6.18	They are to do good, to be rich in good deeds, liberal and generous, 
1TI.6.19	thus laying up for themselves a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of the life which is life indeed.
1TI.6.20	O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid the godless chatter and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge, 
1TI.6.21	for by professing it some have missed the mark as regards the faith.
1TI.6.21	Grace be with you.
2TI.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,
2TI.1.2	To Timothy, my beloved child:
2TI.1.2	Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
2TI.1.3	I thank God whom I serve with a clear conscience, as did my fathers, when I remember you constantly in my prayers. 
2TI.1.4	As I remember your tears, I long night and day to see you, that I may be filled with joy. 
2TI.1.5	 I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, dwells in you. 
2TI.1.6	Hence I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands; 
2TI.1.7	for God did not give us a spirit of timidity but a spirit of power and love and self-control.
2TI.1.8	Do not be ashamed then of testifying to our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but share in suffering for the gospel in the power of God, 
2TI.1.9	who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not in virtue of our works but in virtue of his own purpose and the grace which he gave us in Christ Jesus ages ago, 
2TI.1.10	and now has manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. 
2TI.1.11	For this gospel I was appointed a preacher and apostle and teacher, 
2TI.1.12	and therefore I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am sure that he is able to guard until that Day what has been entrusted to me.
2TI.1.13	Follow the pattern of the sound words which you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus; 
2TI.1.14	guard the truth that has been entrusted to you by the Holy Spirit who dwells within us.
2TI.1.15	You are aware that all who are in Asia turned away from me, and among them Phygelus and Hermogenes. 
2TI.1.16	May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me; he was not ashamed of my chains, 
2TI.1.17	but when he arrived in Rome he searched for me eagerly and found me— 
2TI.1.18	may the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that Day—and you well know all the service he rendered at Ephesus.
2TI.2.1	You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus, 
2TI.2.2	and what you have heard from me before many witnesses entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also. 
2TI.2.3	Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 
2TI.2.4	No soldier on service gets entangled in civilian pursuits, since his aim is to satisfy the one who enlisted him. 
2TI.2.5	An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. 
2TI.2.6	It is the hard-working farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops. 
2TI.2.7	Think over what I say, for the Lord will grant you understanding in everything.
2TI.2.8	Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, descended from David, as preached in my gospel, 
2TI.2.9	the gospel for which I am suffering and wearing fetters like a criminal. But the word of God is not fettered. 
2TI.2.10	Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain salvation in Christ Jesus with its eternal glory. 
2TI.2.11	The saying is sure:
2TI.2.11	If we have died with him, we shall also live with him;
2TI.2.12	if we endure, we shall also reign with him;
2TI.2.12	if we deny him, he also will deny us;
2TI.2.13	if we are faithless, he remains faithful—
2TI.2.13	for he cannot deny himself.
2TI.2.14	Remind them of this, and charge them before the Lord
2TI.2.15	Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth. 
2TI.2.16	Avoid such godless chatter, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness, 
2TI.2.17	and their talk will eat its way like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, 
2TI.2.18	who have swerved from the truth by holding that the resurrection is past already. They are upsetting the faith of some. 
2TI.2.19	 But God's firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.”
2TI.2.20	In a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and earthenware, and some for noble use, some for ignoble. 
2TI.2.21	If any one purifies himself from what is ignoble, then he will be a vessel for noble use, consecrated and useful to the master of the house, ready for any good work. 
2TI.2.22	So shun youthful passions and aim at righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call upon the Lord from a pure heart. 
2TI.2.23	Have nothing to do with stupid, senseless controversies; you know that they breed quarrels. 
2TI.2.24	And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kindly to every one, an apt teacher, forbearing, 
2TI.2.25	correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant that they will repent and come to know the truth, 
2TI.2.26	and they may escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will.
2TI.3.1	But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of stress. 
2TI.3.2	For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, 
2TI.3.3	inhuman, implacable, slanderers, profligates, fierce, haters of good, 
2TI.3.4	treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, 
2TI.3.5	holding the form of religion but denying the power of it. Avoid such people. 
2TI.3.6	For among them are those who make their way into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and swayed by various impulses, 
2TI.3.7	who will listen to anybody and can never arrive at a knowledge of the truth. 
2TI.3.8	 As Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men of corrupt mind and counterfeit faith; 
2TI.3.9	but they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, as was that of those two men.
2TI.3.10	Now you have observed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness, 
2TI.3.11	 my persecutions, my sufferings, what befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra, what persecutions I endured; yet from them all the Lord rescued me. 
2TI.3.12	Indeed all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, 
2TI.3.13	while evil men and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceivers and deceived. 
2TI.3.14	But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it 
2TI.3.15	and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings which are able to instruct you for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.3.16	All scripture is inspired by God and
2TI.3.17	that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.
2TI.4.1	I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: 
2TI.4.2	preach the word, be urgent in season and out of season, convince, rebuke, and exhort, be unfailing in patience and in teaching. 
2TI.4.3	For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own likings, 
2TI.4.4	and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander into myths. 
2TI.4.5	As for you, always be steady, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil your ministry.
2TI.4.6	For I am already on the point of being sacrificed; the time of my departure has come. 
2TI.4.7	I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. 
2TI.4.8	Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that Day, and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing.
2TI.4.9	Do your best to come to me soon. 
2TI.4.10	For Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia,
2TI.4.11	Luke alone is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you; for he is very useful in serving me. 
2TI.4.12	Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus. 
2TI.4.13	When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, also the books, and above all the parchments. 
2TI.4.14	Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm; the Lord will requite him for his deeds. 
2TI.4.15	Beware of him yourself, for he strongly opposed our message. 
2TI.4.16	At my first defense no one took my part; all deserted me. May it not be charged against them! 
2TI.4.17	But the Lord stood by me and gave me strength to proclaim the message fully, that all the Gentiles might hear it. So I was rescued from the lion's mouth. 
2TI.4.18	The Lord will rescue me from every evil and save me for his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
2TI.4.19	Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus. 
2TI.4.20	Erastus remained at Corinth; Trophimus I left ill at Miletus. 
2TI.4.21	Do your best to come before winter. Eubulus sends greetings to you, as do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren.
2TI.4.22	The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.
TIT.1.1	Paul, a servant
TIT.1.2	in hope of eternal life which God, who never lies, promised ages ago 
TIT.1.3	and at the proper time manifested in his word through the preaching with which I have been entrusted by command of God our Savior;
TIT.1.4	To Titus, my true child in a common faith:
TIT.1.4	Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
TIT.1.5	This is why I left you in Crete, that you might amend what was defective, and appoint elders in every town as I directed you, 
TIT.1.6	if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, and his children are believers and not open to the charge of being profligate or insubordinate. 
TIT.1.7	For a bishop, as God's steward, must be blameless; he must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain, 
TIT.1.8	but hospitable, a lover of goodness, master of himself, upright, holy, and self-controlled; 
TIT.1.9	he must hold firm to the sure word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it. 
TIT.1.10	For there are many insubordinate men, empty talkers and deceivers, especially the circumcision party; 
TIT.1.11	they must be silenced, since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for base gain what they have no right to teach. 
TIT.1.12	 One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.” 
TIT.1.13	This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, 
TIT.1.14	instead of giving heed to Jewish myths or to commands of men who reject the truth. 
TIT.1.15	To the pure all things are pure, but to the corrupt and unbelieving nothing is pure; their very minds and consciences are corrupted. 
TIT.1.16	They profess to know God, but they deny him by their deeds; they are detestable, disobedient, unfit for any good deed.
TIT.2.1	But as for you, teach what befits sound doctrine. 
TIT.2.2	Bid the older men be temperate, serious, sensible, sound in faith, in love, and in steadfastness. 
TIT.2.3	Bid the older women likewise to be reverent in behavior, not to be slanderers or slaves to drink; they are to teach what is good, 
TIT.2.4	and so train the young women to love their husbands and children, 
TIT.2.5	to be sensible, chaste, domestic, kind, and submissive to their husbands, that the word of God may not be discredited. 
TIT.2.6	Likewise urge the younger men to control themselves. 
TIT.2.7	Show yourself in all respects a model of good deeds, and in your teaching show integrity, gravity, 
TIT.2.8	and sound speech that cannot be censured, so that an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say of us. 
TIT.2.9	Bid slaves to be submissive to their masters and to give satisfaction in every respect; they are not to be refractory, 
TIT.2.10	nor to pilfer, but to show entire and true fidelity, so that in everything they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior.
TIT.2.11	For the grace of God has appeared for the salvation of all men, 
TIT.2.12	training us to renounce irreligion and worldly passions, and to live sober, upright, and godly lives in this world, 
TIT.2.13	awaiting our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior
TIT.2.14	 who gave himself for us to redeem us from all iniquity and to purify for himself a people of his own who are zealous for good deeds.
TIT.2.15	Declare these things; exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one disregard you.
TIT.3.1	Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for any honest work, 
TIT.3.2	to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and to show perfect courtesy toward all men. 
TIT.3.3	For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by men and hating one another; 
TIT.3.4	but when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, 
TIT.3.5	he saved us, not because of deeds done by us in righteousness, but in virtue of his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal in the Holy Spirit, 
TIT.3.6	which he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, 
TIT.3.7	so that we might be justified by his grace and become heirs in hope of eternal life. 
TIT.3.8	The saying is sure.
TIT.3.8	I desire you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to apply themselves to good deeds;
TIT.3.9	But avoid stupid controversies, genealogies, dissensions, and quarrels over the law, for they are unprofitable and futile.

PHM.1.1	Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,
PHM.1.1	To Philemon our beloved fellow worker 
PHM.1.2	and Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier, and the church in your house:
PHM.1.5	because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and all the saints, 
PHM.1.6	and I pray that the sharing of your faith may promote the knowledge of all the good that is ours in Christ. 
PHM.1.7	For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you.
PHM.1.8	Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required, 
PHM.1.9	yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you—I, Paul, an ambassador
PHM.1.10	 I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I have become in my imprisonment. 
PHM.1.11	(Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful
PHM.1.12	I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart. 
PHM.1.13	I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel; 
PHM.1.14	but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own free will.
PHM.1.15	Perhaps this is why he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back for ever, 
PHM.1.16	no longer as a slave but more than a slave, as a beloved brother, especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. 
PHM.1.17	So if you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me. 
PHM.1.18	If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account. 
PHM.1.19	I, Paul, write this with my own hand, I will repay it—to say nothing of your owing me even your own self. 
PHM.1.20	Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.
PHM.1.21	Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say. 
PHM.1.22	At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping through your prayers to be granted to you.
PHM.1.24	 and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
PHM.1.25	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
HEB.1.1	In many and various ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets; 
HEB.1.2	but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world. 
HEB.1.3	He reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp of his nature, upholding the universe by his word of power. When he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, 
HEB.1.4	having become as much superior to angels as the name he has obtained is more excellent than theirs.
HEB.1.5	“Thou art my Son,
HEB.1.5	today I have begotten thee”?
HEB.1.5	Or again,
HEB.1.5	“I will be to him a father,
HEB.1.5	and he shall be to me a son”?
HEB.1.6	“Let all God's angels worship him.”
HEB.1.7	“Who makes his angels winds,
HEB.1.7	and his servants flames of fire.”
HEB.1.8	“Thy throne, O God,
HEB.1.8	the righteous scepter is the scepter of thy
HEB.1.9	Thou hast loved righteousness and hated lawlessness;
HEB.1.9	therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee
HEB.1.9	with the oil of gladness beyond thy comrades.”
HEB.1.10	“Thou, Lord, didst found the earth in the beginning,
HEB.1.10	and the heavens are the work of thy hands;
HEB.1.11	they will perish, but thou remainest;
HEB.1.11	they will all grow old like a garment,
HEB.1.12	like a mantle thou wilt roll them up,
HEB.1.12	and they will be changed.
HEB.1.12	But thou are the same,
HEB.1.12	and thy years will never end.”
HEB.1.13	“Sit at my right hand
HEB.1.13	till I make thy enemies
HEB.1.13	a stool for thy feet”?
HEB.1.14	Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to serve, for the sake of those who are to obtain salvation?
HEB.2.1	Therefore we must pay the closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it. 
HEB.2.2	For if the message declared by angels was valid and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution, 
HEB.2.3	how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard him, 
HEB.2.4	while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his own will.
HEB.2.5	For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, of which we are speaking. 
HEB.2.6	 It has been testified somewhere,
HEB.2.6	“What is man that thou art mindful of him,
HEB.2.6	or the son of man, that thou carest for him?
HEB.2.7	Thou didst make him for a little while lower than the angels,
HEB.2.7	thou hast crowned him with glory and honor,
HEB.2.8	putting everything in subjection under his feet.”
HEB.2.8	Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. As it is, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him. 
HEB.2.9	But we see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for every one.
HEB.2.10	For it was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through suffering. 
HEB.2.11	For he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified have all one origin. That is why he is not ashamed to call them brethren, 
HEB.2.12	 saying,
HEB.2.12	“I will proclaim thy name to my brethren,
HEB.2.12	in the midst of the congregation I will praise thee.”
HEB.2.13	“I will put my trust in him.”
HEB.2.13	And again,
HEB.2.13	“Here am I, and the children God has given me.”
HEB.2.14	Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same nature, that through death he might destroy him who has the power of death, that is, the devil, 
HEB.2.15	and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong bondage. 
HEB.2.16	 For surely it is not with angels that he is concerned but with the descendants of Abraham. 
HEB.2.17	Therefore he had to be made like his brethren in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make expiation for the sins of the people. 
HEB.2.18	For because he himself has suffered and been tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.
HEB.3.1	Therefore, holy brethren, who share in a heavenly call, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession. 
HEB.3.2	 He was faithful to him who appointed him, just as Moses also was faithful in
HEB.3.3	Yet Jesus has been counted worthy of as much more glory than Moses as the builder of a house has more honor than the house. 
HEB.3.4	(For every house is built by some one, but the builder of all things is God.) 
HEB.3.5	 Now Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant, to testify to the things that were to be spoken later, 
HEB.3.6	but Christ was faithful over God's
HEB.3.7	“Today, when you hear his voice,
HEB.3.8	do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,
HEB.3.8	on the day of testing in the wilderness,
HEB.3.9	where your fathers put me to the test
HEB.3.9	and saw my works for forty years.
HEB.3.10	Therefore I was provoked with that generation,
HEB.3.10	and said, ‘They always go astray in their hearts;
HEB.3.10	they have not known my ways.’
HEB.3.11	As I swore in my wrath,
HEB.3.11	‘They shall never enter my rest.’ ”
HEB.3.12	Take care, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God. 
HEB.3.13	But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called “today,” that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. 
HEB.3.14	For we share in Christ, if only we hold our first confidence firm to the end, 
HEB.3.15	 while it is said,
HEB.3.15	“Today, when you hear his voice,
HEB.3.15	do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”
HEB.3.17	 And with whom was he provoked forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? 
HEB.3.18	And to whom did he swear that they should never enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient? 
HEB.3.19	So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.
HEB.4.1	Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest remains, let us fear lest any of you be judged to have failed to reach it. 
HEB.4.2	For good news came to us just as to them; but the message which they heard did not benefit them, because it did not meet with faith in the hearers.
HEB.4.3	 For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said,
HEB.4.3	“As I swore in my wrath,
HEB.4.3	‘They shall never enter my rest,’ ”
HEB.4.3	although his works were finished from the foundation of the world. 
HEB.4.4	 For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way, “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.” 
HEB.4.5	 And again in this place he said,
HEB.4.5	“They shall never enter my rest.”
HEB.4.6	Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience, 
HEB.4.7	 again he sets a certain day, “Today,” saying through David so long afterward, in the words already quoted,
HEB.4.7	“Today, when you hear his voice,
HEB.4.7	do not harden your hearts.”
HEB.4.8	For if Joshua had given them rest, God
HEB.4.9	So then, there remains a sabbath rest for the people of God; 
HEB.4.10	 for whoever enters God's rest also ceases from his labors as God did from his.
HEB.4.11	Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, that no one fall by the same sort of disobedience. 
HEB.4.12	For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. 
HEB.4.13	And before him no creature is hidden, but all are open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
HEB.4.14	Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. 
HEB.4.15	For we have not a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. 
HEB.4.16	Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
HEB.5.1	For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. 
HEB.5.2	He can deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, since he himself is beset with weakness. 
HEB.5.3	Because of this he is bound to offer sacrifice for his own sins as well as for those of the people. 
HEB.5.4	And one does not take the honor upon himself, but he is called by God, just as Aaron was.
HEB.5.5	“Thou art my Son,
HEB.5.5	today I have begotten thee”;
HEB.5.6	“Thou art a priest for ever,
HEB.5.6	after the order of Melchizedek.”
HEB.5.8	Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered; 
HEB.5.9	 and being made perfect he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him, 
HEB.5.10	 being designated by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.
HEB.5.11	About this we have much to say which is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing. 
HEB.5.12	For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need some one to teach you again the first principles of God's word. You need milk, not solid food; 
HEB.5.13	for every one who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a child. 
HEB.5.14	But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their faculties trained by practice to distinguish good from evil.
HEB.6.1	Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, 
HEB.6.2	with instruction
HEB.6.3	And this we will do if God permits.
HEB.6.4	For it is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, 
HEB.6.5	and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come, 
HEB.6.6	if they then commit apostasy, since they crucify the Son of God on their own account and hold him up to contempt. 
HEB.6.7	For land which has drunk the rain that often falls upon it, and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God. 
HEB.6.8	 But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed; its end is to be burned.
HEB.6.9	Though we speak thus, yet in your case, beloved, we feel sure of better things that belong to salvation. 
HEB.6.10	For God is not so unjust as to overlook your work and the love which you showed for his sake in serving the saints, as you still do. 
HEB.6.11	And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness in realizing the full assurance of hope until the end, 
HEB.6.12	so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
HEB.6.14	saying, “Surely I will bless you and multiply you.” 
HEB.6.15	And thus Abraham,
HEB.6.16	Men indeed swear by a greater than themselves, and in all their disputes an oath is final for confirmation. 
HEB.6.17	So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he interposed with an oath, 
HEB.6.18	so that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible that God should prove false, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to seize the hope set before us. 
HEB.6.19	 We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner shrine behind the curtain, 
HEB.6.20	 where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.
HEB.7.2	and to him Abraham apportioned a tenth part of everything. He is first, by translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then he is also king of Salem, that is, king of peace. 
HEB.7.3	He is without father or mother or genealogy, and has neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God he continues a priest for ever.
HEB.7.4	See how great he is! Abraham the patriarch gave him a tithe of the spoils. 
HEB.7.5	And those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to take tithes from the people, that is, from their brethren, though these also are descended from Abraham. 
HEB.7.6	But this man who has not their genealogy received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. 
HEB.7.7	It is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior. 
HEB.7.8	Here tithes are received by mortal men; there, by one of whom it is testified that he lives. 
HEB.7.9	One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham, 
HEB.7.10	for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him.
HEB.7.12	For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well. 
HEB.7.13	For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar. 
HEB.7.14	For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.
HEB.7.15	This becomes even more evident when another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek, 
HEB.7.16	who has become a priest, not according to a legal requirement concerning bodily descent but by the power of an indestructible life. 
HEB.7.17	For it is witnessed of him,
HEB.7.17	“Thou art a priest for ever,
HEB.7.17	after the order of Melchizedek.”
HEB.7.18	On the one hand, a former commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness 
HEB.7.19	(for the law made nothing perfect); on the other hand, a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God.
HEB.7.20	And it was not without an oath. 
HEB.7.21	Those who formerly became priests took their office without an oath, but this one was addressed with an oath,
HEB.7.21	“The Lord has sworn
HEB.7.21	and will not change his mind,
HEB.7.21	‘Thou art a priest for ever.’ ”
HEB.7.22	This makes Jesus the surety of a better covenant.
HEB.7.23	The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office; 
HEB.7.24	but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues for ever. 
HEB.7.25	Consequently he is able for all time to save those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.
HEB.7.26	For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, blameless, unstained, separated from sinners, exalted above the heavens. 
HEB.7.27	He has no need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices daily, first for his own sins and then for those of the people; he did this once for all when he offered up himself. 
HEB.7.28	Indeed, the law appoints men in their weakness as high priests, but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect for ever.
HEB.8.2	a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent
HEB.8.3	For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; hence it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer. 
HEB.8.4	Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law. 
HEB.8.5	 They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary; for when Moses was about to erect the tent,
HEB.8.6	But as it is, Christ
HEB.8.7	For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion for a second.
HEB.8.8	“The days will come, says the Lord,
HEB.8.8	when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel
HEB.8.8	and with the house of Judah;
HEB.8.9	not like the covenant that I made with their fathers
HEB.8.9	on the day when I took them by the hand
HEB.8.9	to lead them out of the land of Egypt;
HEB.8.9	for they did not continue in my covenant,
HEB.8.9	and so I paid no heed to them, says the Lord.
HEB.8.10	This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel
HEB.8.10	after those days, says the Lord:
HEB.8.10	I will put my laws into their minds,
HEB.8.10	and write them on their hearts,
HEB.8.10	and I will be their God,
HEB.8.10	and they shall be my people.
HEB.8.11	And they shall not teach every one his fellow
HEB.8.11	or every one his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’
HEB.8.11	for all shall know me,
HEB.8.11	from the least of them to the greatest.
HEB.8.12	For I will be merciful toward their iniquities,
HEB.8.12	and I will remember their sins no more.”
HEB.8.13	In speaking of a new covenant he treats the first as obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.
HEB.9.2	 For a tent
HEB.9.3	 Behind the second curtain stood a tent
HEB.9.4	 having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, which contained a golden urn holding the manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant; 
HEB.9.5	above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.
HEB.9.6	These preparations having thus been made, the priests go continually into the outer tent,
HEB.9.7	 but into the second only the high priest goes, and he but once a year, and not without taking blood which he offers for himself and for the errors of the people. 
HEB.9.8	By this the Holy Spirit indicates that the way into the sanctuary is not yet opened as long as the outer tent
HEB.9.9	(which is symbolic for the present age). According to this arrangement, gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper, 
HEB.9.10	but deal only with food and drink and various ablutions, regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation.
HEB.9.11	But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come,
HEB.9.12	he entered once for all into the Holy Place, taking
HEB.9.13	 For if the sprinkling of defiled persons with the blood of goats and bulls and with the ashes of a heifer sanctifies for the purification of the flesh, 
HEB.9.14	how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify your
HEB.9.15	Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, since a death has occurred which redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant.
HEB.9.16	For where a will
HEB.9.17	For a will
HEB.9.18	Hence even the first covenant was not ratified without blood. 
HEB.9.19	 For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, 
HEB.9.20	saying, “This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded you.” 
HEB.9.21	And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent
HEB.9.22	Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.
HEB.9.23	Thus it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. 
HEB.9.24	For Christ has entered, not into a sanctuary made with hands, a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf. 
HEB.9.25	Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the Holy Place yearly with blood not his own; 
HEB.9.26	for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the age to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. 
HEB.9.27	And just as it is appointed for men to die once, and after that comes judgment, 
HEB.9.28	so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.
HEB.10.1	For since the law has but a shadow of the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices which are continually offered year after year, make perfect those who draw near. 
HEB.10.2	Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered? If the worshipers had once been cleansed, they would no longer have any consciousness of sin. 
HEB.10.3	But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sin year after year. 
HEB.10.4	For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.
HEB.10.5	“Sacrifices and offerings thou hast not desired,
HEB.10.5	but a body hast thou prepared for me;
HEB.10.6	in burnt offerings and sin offerings thou hast taken no pleasure.
HEB.10.7	Then I said, ‘Lo, I have come to do thy will, O God,’
HEB.10.7	as it is written of me in the roll of the book.”
HEB.10.8	When he said above, “Thou hast neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings” (these are offered according to the law), 
HEB.10.9	then he added, “Lo, I have come to do thy will.” He abolishes the first in order to establish the second. 
HEB.10.10	And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
HEB.10.11	And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. 
HEB.10.12	 But when Christ
HEB.10.13	then to wait until his enemies should be made a stool for his feet. 
HEB.10.14	For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are sanctified. 
HEB.10.15	And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,
HEB.10.16	after those days, says the Lord:
HEB.10.16	I will put my laws on their hearts,
HEB.10.16	and write them on their minds,”
HEB.10.17	then he adds,
HEB.10.17	“I will remember their sins and their misdeeds no more.”
HEB.10.18	Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.
HEB.10.19	Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus, 
HEB.10.20	by the new and living way which he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh, 
HEB.10.21	and since we have a great priest over the house of God, 
HEB.10.22	let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. 
HEB.10.23	Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful; 
HEB.10.24	and let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, 
HEB.10.25	not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.
HEB.10.26	For if we sin deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, 
HEB.10.27	 but a fearful prospect of judgment, and a fury of fire which will consume the adversaries. 
HEB.10.28	 A man who has violated the law of Moses dies without mercy at the testimony of two or three witnesses. 
HEB.10.29	 How much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by the man who has spurned the Son of God, and profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and outraged the Spirit of grace? 
HEB.10.30	 For we know him who said, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay.” And again, “The Lord will judge his people.” 
HEB.10.31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
HEB.10.32	But recall the former days when, after you were enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings, 
HEB.10.33	sometimes being publicly exposed to abuse and affliction, and sometimes being partners with those so treated. 
HEB.10.34	For you had compassion on the prisoners, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one. 
HEB.10.35	Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward. 
HEB.10.36	For you have need of endurance, so that you may do the will of God and receive what is promised.
HEB.10.37	and the coming one shall come and shall not tarry;
HEB.10.38	but my righteous one shall live by faith,
HEB.10.38	and if he shrinks back,
HEB.10.38	my soul has no pleasure in him.”
HEB.10.39	But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and keep their souls.
HEB.11.1	Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. 
HEB.11.2	For by it the men of old received divine approval. 
HEB.11.3	By faith we understand that the world was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was made out of things which do not appear.
HEB.11.5	 By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God had taken him. Now before he was taken he was attested as having pleased God. 
HEB.11.6	And without faith it is impossible to please him. For whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. 
HEB.11.7	 By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, took heed and constructed an ark for the saving of his household; by this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness which comes by faith.
HEB.11.9	By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise. 
HEB.11.10	For he looked forward to the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God. 
HEB.11.11	 By faith Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, since she considered him faithful who had promised. 
HEB.11.12	 Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.
HEB.11.14	For people who speak thus make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. 
HEB.11.15	If they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out, they would have had opportunity to return. 
HEB.11.16	 But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.
HEB.11.18	 of whom it was said, “Through Isaac shall your descendants be named.” 
HEB.11.19	He considered that God was able to raise men even from the dead; hence, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back. 
HEB.11.20	 By faith Isaac invoked future blessings on Jacob and Esau. 
HEB.11.21	 By faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, bowing in worship over the head of his staff. 
HEB.11.22	 By faith Joseph, at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites and gave directions concerning his burial.
HEB.11.24	 By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, 
HEB.11.25	choosing rather to share ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. 
HEB.11.26	He considered abuse suffered for the Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he looked to the reward. 
HEB.11.27	 By faith he left Egypt, not being afraid of the anger of the king; for he endured as seeing him who is invisible. 
HEB.11.28	 By faith he kept the Passover and sprinkled the blood, so that the Destroyer of the first-born might not touch them.
HEB.11.30	 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days. 
HEB.11.31	 By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had given friendly welcome to the spies.
HEB.11.33	 who through faith conquered kingdoms, enforced justice, received promises, stopped the mouths of lions, 
HEB.11.34	 quenched raging fire, escaped the edge of the sword, won strength out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. 
HEB.11.35	 Women received their dead by resurrection. Some were tortured, refusing to accept release, that they might rise again to a better life. 
HEB.11.36	Others suffered mocking and scourging, and even chains and imprisonment. 
HEB.11.37	They were stoned, they were sawn in two,
HEB.11.38	of whom the world was not worthy—wandering over deserts and mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.
HEB.11.39	And all these, though well attested by their faith, did not receive what was promised, 
HEB.11.40	since God had foreseen something better for us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect.
HEB.12.1	Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us, 
HEB.12.2	 looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.
HEB.12.3	Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted. 
HEB.12.4	In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. 
HEB.12.5	 And have you forgotten the exhortation which addresses you as sons?—
HEB.12.5	“My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,
HEB.12.5	nor lose courage when you are punished by him.
HEB.12.6	For the Lord disciplines him whom he loves,
HEB.12.6	and chastises every son whom he receives.”
HEB.12.7	It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline? 
HEB.12.8	If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons. 
HEB.12.9	Besides this, we have had earthly fathers to discipline us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live? 
HEB.12.10	For they disciplined us for a short time at their pleasure, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness. 
HEB.12.11	For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant; later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.
HEB.12.13	 and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather be healed. 
HEB.12.14	Strive for peace with all men, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord. 
HEB.12.15	 See to it that no one fail to obtain the grace of God; that no “root of bitterness” spring up and cause trouble, and by it the many become defiled; 
HEB.12.16	 that no one be immoral or irreligious like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal. 
HEB.12.17	 For you know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no chance to repent, though he sought it with tears.
HEB.12.19	and the sound of a trumpet, and a voice whose words made the hearers entreat that no further messages be spoken to them. 
HEB.12.20	 For they could not endure the order that was given, “If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned.” 
HEB.12.21	 Indeed, so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, “I tremble with fear.” 
HEB.12.22	But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering, 
HEB.12.23	and to the assembly
HEB.12.24	 and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks more graciously than the blood of Abel.
HEB.12.26	 His voice then shook the earth; but now he has promised, “Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heaven.” 
HEB.12.27	This phrase, “Yet once more,” indicates the removal of what is shaken, as of what has been made, in order that what cannot be shaken may remain. 
HEB.12.28	Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe; 
HEB.12.29	 for our God is a consuming fire.
HEB.13.1	Let brotherly love continue. 
HEB.13.2	 Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. 
HEB.13.3	Remember those who are in prison, as though in prison with them; and those who are ill-treated, since you also are in the body. 
HEB.13.4	Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled; for God will judge the immoral and adulterous. 
HEB.13.5	 Keep your life free from love of money, and be content with what you have; for he has said, “I will never fail you nor forsake you.” 
HEB.13.6	 Hence we can confidently say,
HEB.13.6	“The Lord is my helper,
HEB.13.6	I will not be afraid;
HEB.13.6	what can man do to me?”
HEB.13.7	Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God; consider the outcome of their life, and imitate their faith. 
HEB.13.8	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and for ever. 
HEB.13.9	Do not be led away by diverse and strange teachings; for it is well that the heart be strengthened by grace, not by foods, which have not benefited their adherents. 
HEB.13.10	We have an altar from which those who serve the tent
HEB.13.11	 For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside the camp. 
HEB.13.12	So Jesus also suffered outside the gate in order to sanctify the people through his own blood. 
HEB.13.13	Therefore let us go forth to him outside the camp, and bear the abuse he endured. 
HEB.13.14	For here we have no lasting city, but we seek the city which is to come. 
HEB.13.15	 Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name. 
HEB.13.16	Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God.
HEB.13.17	Obey your leaders and submit to them; for they are keeping watch over your souls, as men who will have to give account. Let them do this joyfully, and not sadly, for that would be of no advantage to you.
HEB.13.18	Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a clear conscience, desiring to act honorably in all things. 
HEB.13.19	I urge you the more earnestly to do this in order that I may be restored to you the sooner.
HEB.13.21	equip you with everything good that you may do his will, working in you
HEB.13.22	I appeal to you, brethren, bear with my word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly. 
HEB.13.23	You should understand that our brother Timothy has been released, with whom I shall see you if he comes soon. 
HEB.13.24	Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those who come from Italy send you greetings. 
HEB.13.25	Grace be with all of you. Amen.
JAS.1.1	James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,
JAS.1.1	To the twelve tribes in the Dispersion:
JAS.1.1	Greeting.
JAS.1.2	Count it all joy, my brethren, when you meet various trials, 
JAS.1.3	for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. 
JAS.1.4	And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.
JAS.1.5	If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives to all men generously and without reproaching, and it will be given him. 
JAS.1.6	But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. 
JAS.1.7+JAS.1.8	For that person must not suppose that a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways, will receive anything from the Lord.
JAS.1.9	Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation, 
JAS.1.10	 and the rich in his humiliation, because like the flower of the grass he will pass away. 
JAS.1.11	For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes. So will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.
JAS.1.12	Blessed is the man who endures trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life which God has promised to those who love him. 
JAS.1.13	Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am tempted by God”; for God cannot be tempted with evil and he himself tempts no one; 
JAS.1.14	but each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. 
JAS.1.15	Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin; and sin when it is full-grown brings forth death.
JAS.1.16	Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren. 
JAS.1.17	Every good endowment and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.
JAS.1.18	Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.
JAS.1.19	Know this, my beloved brethren. Let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger, 
JAS.1.20	for the anger of man does not work the righteousness of God. 
JAS.1.21	Therefore put away all filthiness and rank growth of wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.
JAS.1.22	But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. 
JAS.1.23	For if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who observes his natural face in a mirror; 
JAS.1.24	for he observes himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like. 
JAS.1.25	But he who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer that forgets but a doer that acts, he shall be blessed in his doing.
JAS.1.26	If any one thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this man's religion is vain. 
JAS.1.27	Religion that is pure and undefiled before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.
JAS.2.1	My brethren, show no partiality as you hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory. 
JAS.2.2	For if a man with gold rings and in fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in, 
JAS.2.3	and you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, “Have a seat here, please,” while you say to the poor man, “Stand there,” or, “Sit at my feet,” 
JAS.2.4	have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts? 
JAS.2.5	Listen, my beloved brethren. Has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him? 
JAS.2.6	But you have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress you, is it not they who drag you into court? 
JAS.2.7	Is it not they who blaspheme the honorable name which was invoked over you?
JAS.2.9	But if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors. 
JAS.2.10	For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it. 
JAS.2.11	 For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,” said also, “Do not kill.” If you do not commit adultery but do kill, you have become a transgressor of the law. 
JAS.2.12	So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty. 
JAS.2.13	For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy; yet mercy triumphs over judgment.
JAS.2.14	What does it profit, my brethren, if a man says he has faith but has not works? Can his faith save him? 
JAS.2.15	If a brother or sister is ill-clad and in lack of daily food, 
JAS.2.16	and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what does it profit? 
JAS.2.17	So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead.
JAS.2.18	But some one will say, “You have faith and I have works.” Show me your faith apart from your works, and I by my works will show you my faith. 
JAS.2.19	You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder. 
JAS.2.20	Do you want to be shown, you shallow man, that faith apart from works is barren? 
JAS.2.21	 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he offered his son Isaac upon the altar? 
JAS.2.22	You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by works, 
JAS.2.23	 and the scripture was fulfilled which says, “Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness”; and he was called the friend of God. 
JAS.2.24	You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone. 
JAS.2.25	 And in the same way was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way? 
JAS.2.26	For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so faith apart from works is dead.
JAS.3.1	Let not many of you become teachers, my brethren, for you know that we who teach shall be judged with greater strictness. 
JAS.3.2	For we all make many mistakes, and if any one makes no mistakes in what he says he is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also. 
JAS.3.3	If we put bits into the mouths of horses that they may obey us, we guide their whole bodies. 
JAS.3.4	Look at the ships also; though they are so great and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs. 
JAS.3.5	So the tongue is a little member and boasts of great things. How great a forest is set ablaze by a small fire!
JAS.3.6	And the tongue is a fire. The tongue is an unrighteous world among our members, staining the whole body, setting on fire the cycle of nature,
JAS.3.7	For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by humankind, 
JAS.3.8	but no human being can tame the tongue—a restless evil, full of deadly poison. 
JAS.3.9	With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who are made in the likeness of God. 
JAS.3.10	From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brethren, this ought not to be so. 
JAS.3.11	Does a spring pour forth from the same opening fresh water and brackish? 
JAS.3.12	Can a fig tree, my brethren, yield olives, or a grapevine figs? No more can salt water yield fresh.
JAS.3.13	Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good life let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom. 
JAS.3.14	But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth. 
JAS.3.15	This wisdom is not such as comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, devilish. 
JAS.3.16	For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice. 
JAS.3.17	But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, without uncertainty or insincerity. 
JAS.3.18	And the harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
JAS.4.1	What causes wars, and what causes fightings among you? Is it not your passions that are at war in your members? 
JAS.4.2	You desire and do not have; so you kill. And you covet
JAS.4.3	You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions. 
JAS.4.4	Unfaithful creatures! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. 
JAS.4.5	Or do you suppose it is in vain that the scripture says, “He yearns jealously over the spirit which he has made to dwell in us”? 
JAS.4.6	 But he gives more grace; therefore it says, “God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.” 
JAS.4.7	Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. 
JAS.4.8	Draw near to God and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you men of double mind. 
JAS.4.9	Be wretched and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to dejection. 
JAS.4.10	Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you.
JAS.4.11	Do not speak evil against one another, brethren. He that speaks evil against a brother or judges his brother, speaks evil against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge. 
JAS.4.12	There is one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you that you judge your neighbor?
JAS.4.13	Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and get gain”; 
JAS.4.14	whereas you do not know about tomorrow. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes. 
JAS.4.15	Instead you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we shall live and we shall do this or that.” 
JAS.4.16	As it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil. 
JAS.4.17	Whoever knows what is right to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.
JAS.5.1	Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you. 
JAS.5.2	Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten. 
JAS.5.3	Your gold and silver have rusted, and their rust will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up treasure
JAS.5.4	Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts. 
JAS.5.5	You have lived on the earth in luxury and in pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter. 
JAS.5.6	You have condemned, you have killed the righteous man; he does not resist you.
JAS.5.7	Be patient, therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it until it receives the early and the late rain. 
JAS.5.8	You also be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand. 
JAS.5.9	Do not grumble, brethren, against one another, that you may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing at the doors. 
JAS.5.10	As an example of suffering and patience, brethren, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. 
JAS.5.11	 Behold, we call those happy who were steadfast. You have heard of the steadfastness of Job, and you have seen the purpose of the Lord, how the Lord is compassionate and merciful.
JAS.5.13	Is any one among you suffering? Let him pray. Is any cheerful? Let him sing praise. 
JAS.5.14	Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; 
JAS.5.15	and the prayer of faith will save the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. 
JAS.5.16	Therefore confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man has great power in its effects. 
JAS.5.17	 Elijah was a man of like nature with ourselves and he prayed fervently that it might not rain, and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth. 
JAS.5.18	 Then he prayed again and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth its fruit.
JAS.5.19	My brethren, if any one among you wanders from the truth and some one brings him back, 
JAS.5.20	let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.
1PE.1.1	Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ,
1PE.1.1	To the exiles of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, 
1PE.1.2	chosen and destined by God the Father and sanctified by the Spirit for obedience to Jesus Christ and for sprinkling with his blood:
1PE.1.2	May grace and peace be multiplied to you.
1PE.1.3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! By his great mercy we have been born anew to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 
1PE.1.4	and to an inheritance which is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, 
1PE.1.5	who by God's power are guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. 
1PE.1.6	In this you rejoice,
1PE.1.7	so that the genuineness of your faith, more precious than gold which though perishable is tested by fire, may redound to praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. 
1PE.1.8	Without having seen
1PE.1.9	As the outcome of your faith you obtain the salvation of your souls.
1PE.1.10	The prophets who prophesied of the grace that was to be yours searched and inquired about this salvation; 
1PE.1.11	they inquired what person or time was indicated by the Spirit of Christ within them when predicting the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glory. 
1PE.1.12	It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you, in the things which have now been announced to you by those who preached the good news to you through the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look.
1PE.1.13	Therefore gird up your minds, be sober, set your hope fully upon the grace that is coming to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. 
1PE.1.14	As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, 
1PE.1.15	but as he who called you is holy, be holy yourselves in all your conduct; 
1PE.1.16	 since it is written, “You shall be holy, for I am holy.” 
1PE.1.17	And if you invoke as Father him who judges each one impartially according to his deeds, conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile. 
1PE.1.18	You know that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your fathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold, 
1PE.1.19	but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot. 
1PE.1.20	He was destined before the foundation of the world but was made manifest at the end of the times for your sake. 
1PE.1.21	Through him you have confidence in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.
1PE.1.22	Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for a sincere love of the brethren, love one another earnestly from the heart. 
1PE.1.23	You have been born anew, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God; 
1PE.1.24	 for
1PE.1.24	“All flesh is like grass
1PE.1.24	and all its glory like the flower of grass.
1PE.1.24	The grass withers, and the flower falls,
1PE.1.25	but the word of the Lord abides for ever.”
1PE.1.25	That word is the good news which was preached to you.
1PE.2.1	So put away all malice and all guile and insincerity and envy and all slander. 
1PE.2.2	Like newborn babes, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up to salvation; 
1PE.2.3	 for you have tasted the kindness of the Lord.
1PE.2.5	and like living stones be yourselves built into a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. 
1PE.2.6	 For it stands in scripture:
1PE.2.6	“Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious,
1PE.2.6	and he who believes in him will not be put to shame.”
1PE.2.7	“The very stone which the builders rejected
1PE.2.7	has become the head of the corner,”
1PE.2.8	and
1PE.2.8	a rock that will make them fall”;
1PE.2.8	for they stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do.
1PE.2.10	 Once you were no people but now you are God's people; once you had not received mercy but now you have received mercy.
1PE.2.11	Beloved, I beseech you as aliens and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh that wage war against your soul. 
1PE.2.12	Maintain good conduct among the Gentiles, so that in case they speak against you as wrongdoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation.
1PE.2.13	Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution,
1PE.2.14	or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right. 
1PE.2.15	For it is God's will that by doing right you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men. 
1PE.2.16	Live as free men, yet without using your freedom as a pretext for evil; but live as servants of God. 
1PE.2.17	Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the emperor.
1PE.2.18	Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to the kind and gentle but also to the overbearing. 
1PE.2.19	For one is approved if, mindful of God, he endures pain while suffering unjustly. 
1PE.2.20	For what credit is it, if when you do wrong and are beaten for it you take it patiently? But if when you do right and suffer for it you take it patiently, you have God's approval. 
1PE.2.21	For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. 
1PE.2.22	 He committed no sin; no guile was found on his lips. 
1PE.2.23	When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten; but he trusted to him who judges justly. 
1PE.2.25	For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.
1PE.3.1	Likewise you wives, be submissive to your husbands, so that some, though they do not obey the word, may be won without a word by the behavior of their wives, 
1PE.3.2	when they see your reverent and chaste behavior. 
1PE.3.3	Let not yours be the outward adorning with braiding of hair, decoration of gold, and wearing of fine clothing, 
1PE.3.4	but let it be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable jewel of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious. 
1PE.3.5	So once the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves and were submissive to their husbands, 
1PE.3.6	 as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you are now her children if you do right and let nothing terrify you.
1PE.3.7	Likewise you husbands, live considerately with your wives, bestowing honor on the woman as the weaker sex, since you are joint heirs of the grace of life, in order that your prayers may not be hindered.
1PE.3.8	Finally, all of you, have unity of spirit, sympathy, love of the brethren, a tender heart and a humble mind. 
1PE.3.9	Do not return evil for evil or reviling for reviling; but on the contrary bless, for to this you have been called, that you may obtain a blessing. 
1PE.3.10	 For
1PE.3.10	“He that would love life
1PE.3.10	and see good days,
1PE.3.10	let him keep his tongue from evil
1PE.3.10	and his lips from speaking guile;
1PE.3.11	let him turn away from evil and do right;
1PE.3.11	let him seek peace and pursue it.
1PE.3.12	For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous,
1PE.3.12	and his ears are open to their prayer.
1PE.3.12	But the face of the Lord is against those that do evil.”
1PE.3.13	Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is right? 
1PE.3.14	 But even if you do suffer for righteousness' sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, 
1PE.3.15	but in your hearts reverence Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to make a defense to any one who calls you to account for the hope that is in you, yet do it with gentleness and reverence; 
1PE.3.16	and keep your conscience clear, so that, when you are abused, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame. 
1PE.3.17	For it is better to suffer for doing right, if that should be God's will, than for doing wrong. 
1PE.3.18	For Christ also died
1PE.3.19	in which he went and preached to the spirits in prison, 
1PE.3.20	 who formerly did not obey, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, during the building of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were saved through water. 
1PE.3.21	Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a clear conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 
1PE.3.22	who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers subject to him.
1PE.4.1	Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh,
1PE.4.2	so as to live for the rest of the time in the flesh no longer by human passions but by the will of God. 
1PE.4.3	Let the time that is past suffice for doing what the Gentiles like to do, living in licentiousness, passions, drunkenness, revels, carousing, and lawless idolatry. 
1PE.4.4	They are surprised that you do not now join them in the same wild profligacy, and they abuse you; 
1PE.4.5	but they will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. 
1PE.4.6	For this is why the gospel was preached even to the dead, that though judged in the flesh like men, they might live in the spirit like God.
1PE.4.7	The end of all things is at hand; therefore keep sane and sober for your prayers. 
1PE.4.8	Above all hold unfailing your love for one another, since love covers a multitude of sins. 
1PE.4.9	Practice hospitality ungrudgingly to one another. 
1PE.4.10	As each has received a gift, employ it for one another, as good stewards of God's varied grace: 
1PE.4.11	whoever speaks, as one who utters oracles of God; whoever renders service, as one who renders it by the strength which God supplies; in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him belong glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
1PE.4.12	Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal which comes upon you to prove you, as though something strange were happening to you. 
1PE.4.13	But rejoice in so far as you share Christ's sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed. 
1PE.4.14	 If you are reproached for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the spirit of glory
1PE.4.15	But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a wrongdoer, or a mischief-maker; 
1PE.4.16	yet if one suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but under that name let him glorify God. 
1PE.4.17	For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if it begins with us, what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God? 
1PE.4.18	 And
1PE.4.18	“If the righteous man is scarcely saved,
1PE.4.18	where will the impious and sinner appear?”
1PE.4.19	Therefore let those who suffer according to God's will do right and entrust their souls to a faithful Creator.
1PE.5.1	So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ as well as a partaker in the glory that is to be revealed. 
1PE.5.2	Tend the flock of God that is your charge,
1PE.5.3	not as domineering over those in your charge but being examples to the flock. 
1PE.5.4	And when the chief Shepherd is manifested you will obtain the unfading crown of glory. 
1PE.5.5	 Likewise you that are younger be subject to the elders. Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for “God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”
1PE.5.6	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that in due time he may exalt you. 
1PE.5.7	 Cast all your anxieties on him, for he cares about you. 
1PE.5.8	Be sober, be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking some one to devour. 
1PE.5.9	Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experience of suffering is required of your brotherhood throughout the world. 
1PE.5.10	And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, establish, and strengthen
1PE.5.11	To him be the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
1PE.5.12	By Silvanus, a faithful brother as I regard him, I have written briefly to you, exhorting and declaring that this is the true grace of God; stand fast in it. 
1PE.5.13	She who is at Babylon, who is likewise chosen, sends you greetings; and so does my son Mark. 
1PE.5.14	Greet one another with the kiss of love.
1PE.5.14	Peace to all of you that are in Christ.
2PE.1.1	Simeon
2PE.1.1	To those who have obtained a faith of equal standing with ours in the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ:
2PE.1.2	May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
2PE.1.3	His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to
2PE.1.4	by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, that through these you may escape from the corruption that is in the world because of passion, and become partakers of the divine nature. 
2PE.1.5	For this very reason make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, 
2PE.1.6	and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, 
2PE.1.7	and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love. 
2PE.1.8	For if these things are yours and abound, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
2PE.1.9	For whoever lacks these things is blind and shortsighted and has forgotten that he was cleansed from his old sins. 
2PE.1.10	Therefore, brethren, be the more zealous to confirm your call and election, for if you do this you will never fall; 
2PE.1.11	so there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
2PE.1.12	Therefore I intend always to remind you of these things, though you know them and are established in the truth that you have. 
2PE.1.13	I think it right, as long as I am in this body,
2PE.1.14	since I know that the putting off of my body
2PE.1.15	And I will see to it that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things.
2PE.1.16	For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 
2PE.1.17	 For when he received honor and glory from God the Father and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, “This is my beloved Son,
2PE.1.18	we heard this voice borne from heaven, for we were with him on the holy mountain. 
2PE.1.19	And we have the prophetic word made more sure. You will do well to pay attention to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. 
2PE.1.20	First of all you must understand this, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation, 
2PE.1.21	because no prophecy ever came by the impulse of man, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.
2PE.2.2	And many will follow their licentiousness, and because of them the way of truth will be reviled. 
2PE.2.3	And in their greed they will exploit you with false words; from of old their condemnation has not been idle, and their destruction has not been asleep.
2PE.2.4	For if God did not spare the angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell
2PE.2.5	 if he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a herald of righteousness, with seven other persons, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly; 
2PE.2.6	 if by turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes he condemned them to extinction and made them an example to those who were to be ungodly; 
2PE.2.7	 and if he rescued righteous Lot, greatly distressed by the licentiousness of the wicked 
2PE.2.8	(for by what that righteous man saw and heard as he lived among them, he was vexed in his righteous soul day after day with their lawless deeds), 
2PE.2.9	then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trial, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment, 
2PE.2.10	and especially those who indulge in the lust of defiling passion and despise authority.
2PE.2.10	Bold and wilful, they are not afraid to revile the glorious ones, 
2PE.2.11	whereas angels, though greater in might and power, do not pronounce a reviling judgment upon them before the Lord. 
2PE.2.12	But these, like irrational animals, creatures of instinct, born to be caught and killed, reviling in matters of which they are ignorant, will be destroyed in the same destruction with them, 
2PE.2.13	suffering wrong for their wrongdoing. They count it pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their dissipation,
2PE.2.14	They have eyes full of adultery, insatiable for sin. They entice unsteady souls. They have hearts trained in greed. Accursed children! 
2PE.2.15	 Forsaking the right way they have gone astray; they have followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved gain from wrongdoing, 
2PE.2.16	 but was rebuked for his own transgression; a dumb ass spoke with human voice and restrained the prophet's madness.
2PE.2.17	These are waterless springs and mists driven by a storm; for them the nether gloom of darkness has been reserved. 
2PE.2.18	For, uttering loud boasts of folly, they entice with licentious passions of the flesh men who have barely escaped from those who live in error. 
2PE.2.19	They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption; for whatever overcomes a man, to that he is enslaved. 
2PE.2.20	For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overpowered, the last state has become worse for them than the first. 
2PE.2.21	For it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them. 
2PE.2.22	 It has happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog turns back to his own vomit, and the sow is washed only to wallow in the mire.
2PE.3.1	This is now the second letter that I have written to you, beloved, and in both of them I have aroused your sincere mind by way of reminder; 
2PE.3.2	that you should remember the predictions of the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior through your apostles. 
2PE.3.3	First of all you must understand this, that scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing, following their own passions 
2PE.3.4	and saying, “Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things have continued as they were from the beginning of creation.” 
2PE.3.5	 They deliberately ignore this fact, that by the word of God heavens existed long ago, and an earth formed out of water and by means of water, 
2PE.3.6	through which the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished. 
2PE.3.7	But by the same word the heavens and earth that now exist have been stored up for fire, being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.
2PE.3.9	The Lord is not slow about his promise as some count slowness, but is forbearing toward you,
2PE.3.10	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fire, and the earth and the works that are upon it will be burned up.
2PE.3.11	Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of persons ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness, 
2PE.3.12	 waiting for and hastening
2PE.3.13	 But according to his promise we wait for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.
2PE.3.14	Therefore, beloved, since you wait for these, be zealous to be found by him without spot or blemish, and at peace. 
2PE.3.15	And count the forbearance of our Lord as salvation. So also our beloved brother Paul wrote to you according to the wisdom given him, 
2PE.3.16	speaking of this as he does in all his letters. There are some things in them hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other scriptures. 
2PE.3.17	You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, beware lest you be carried away with the error of lawless men and lose your own stability. 
2PE.3.18	But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.
1JN.1.2	the life was made manifest, and we saw it, and testify to it, and proclaim to you the eternal life which was with the Father and was made manifest to us— 
1JN.1.3	that which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so that you may have fellowship with us; and our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. 
1JN.1.4	 And we are writing this that our
1JN.1.6	 If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not live according to the truth; 
1JN.1.7	 but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. 
1JN.1.8	If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 
1JN.1.9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, and will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 
1JN.1.10	 If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
1JN.2.2	 and he is the expiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world. 
1JN.2.3	 And by this we may be sure that we know him, if we keep his commandments. 
1JN.2.4	 He who says “I know him” but disobeys his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him; 
1JN.2.5	 but whoever keeps his word, in him truly love for God is perfected. By this we may be sure that we are in him: 
1JN.2.6	 he who says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked.
1JN.2.8	 Yet I am writing you a new commandment, which is true in him and in you, because
1JN.2.9	He who says he is in the light and hates his brother is in the darkness still. 
1JN.2.10	 He who loves his brother abides in the light, and in it
1JN.2.11	But he who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
1JN.2.12	I am writing to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven for his sake. 
1JN.2.13	 I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, children, because you know the Father. 
1JN.2.14	I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.
1JN.2.15	Do not love the world or the things in the world. If any one loves the world, love for the Father is not in him. 
1JN.2.16	For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life, is not of the Father but is of the world. 
1JN.2.17	And the world passes away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides for ever.
1JN.2.19	They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us; but they went out, that it might be plain that they all are not of us. 
1JN.2.20	But you have been anointed by the Holy One, and you all know.
1JN.2.21	I write to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and know that no lie is of the truth. 
1JN.2.22	 Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son. 
1JN.2.23	 No one who denies the Son has the Father. He who confesses the Son has the Father also. 
1JN.2.24	Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you will abide in the Son and in the Father. 
1JN.2.25	And this is what he has promised us,
1JN.2.26	I write this to you about those who would deceive you; 
1JN.2.27	 but the anointing which you received from him abides in you, and you have no need that any one should teach you; as his anointing teaches you about everything, and is true, and is no lie, just as it has taught you, abide in him.
1JN.2.29	 If you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that every one who does right is born of him.
1JN.3.2	Beloved, we are God's children now; it does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. 
1JN.3.3	And every one who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.
1JN.3.4	Every one who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. 
1JN.3.5	 You know that he appeared to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. 
1JN.3.6	No one who abides in him sins; no one who sins has either seen him or known him. 
1JN.3.7	Little children, let no one deceive you. He who does right is righteous, as he is righteous. 
1JN.3.8	 He who commits sin is of the devil; for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. 
1JN.3.9	 No one born of God commits sin; for God's
1JN.3.10	By this it may be seen who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not do right is not of God, nor he who does not love his brother.
1JN.3.12	and not be like Cain who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother's righteous. 
1JN.3.13	 Do not wonder, brethren, that the world hates you. 
1JN.3.14	 We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in death. 
1JN.3.15	 Any one who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. 
1JN.3.16	 By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 
1JN.3.17	But if any one has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him? 
1JN.3.18	 Little children, let us not love in word or speech but in deed and in truth.
1JN.3.19	By this we shall know that we are of the truth, and reassure our hearts before him 
1JN.3.20	whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything. 
1JN.3.21	 Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God; 
1JN.3.22	and we receive from him whatever we ask, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him. 
1JN.3.23	 And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us. 
1JN.3.24	 All who keep his commandments abide in him, and he in them. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit which he has given us.
1JN.4.1	Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are of God; for many false prophets have gone out into the world. 
1JN.4.2	By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, 
1JN.4.3	 and every spirit which does not confess Jesus is not of God. This is the spirit of antichrist, of which you heard that it was coming, and now it is in the world already. 
1JN.4.4	Little children, you are of God, and have overcome them; for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. 
1JN.4.5	 They are of the world, therefore what they say is of the world, and the world listens to them. 
1JN.4.6	 We are of God. Whoever knows God listens to us, and he who is not of God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
1JN.4.8	He who does not love does not know God; for God is love. 
1JN.4.9	 In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. 
1JN.4.10	 In this is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the expiation for our sins. 
1JN.4.11	Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 
1JN.4.12	 No man has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.
1JN.4.14	 And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son as the Savior of the world. 
1JN.4.15	Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. 
1JN.4.16	So we know and believe the love God has for us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. 
1JN.4.17	 In this is love perfected with us, that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is so are we in this world. 
1JN.4.18	There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and he who fears is not perfected in love. 
1JN.4.19	 We love, because he first loved us. 
1JN.4.20	 If any one says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot
1JN.4.21	And this commandment we have from him, that he who loves God should love his brother also.
1JN.5.2	By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments. 
1JN.5.3	 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome. 
1JN.5.4	 For whatever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that overcomes the world, our faith. 
1JN.5.5	Who is it that overcomes the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
1JN.5.7	And the Spirit is the witness, because the Spirit is the truth. 
1JN.5.8	There are three witnesses, the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree. 
1JN.5.9	 If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; for this is the testimony of God that he has borne witness to his Son. 
1JN.5.10	 He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne to his Son. 
1JN.5.11	And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 
1JN.5.12	 He who has the Son has life; he who has not the Son of God has not life.
1JN.5.14	 And this is the confidence which we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us. 
1JN.5.15	And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have obtained the requests made of him. 
1JN.5.16	If any one sees his brother committing what is not a mortal sin, he will ask, and God
1JN.5.17	All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin which is not mortal.
1JN.5.19	We know that we are of God, and the whole world is in the power of the evil one.
1JN.5.21	Little children, keep yourselves from idols.
2JN.1.2	because of the truth which abides in us and will be with us for ever:
2JN.1.3	Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Father's Son, in truth and love.
2JN.1.4	I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children following the truth, just as we have been commanded by the Father. 
2JN.1.5	 And now I beg you, lady, not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning, that we love one another. 
2JN.1.6	 And this is love, that we follow his commandments; this is the commandment, as you have heard from the beginning, that you follow love. 
2JN.1.7	 For many deceivers have gone out into the world, men who will not acknowledge the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh; such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist. 
2JN.1.8	Look to yourselves, that you may not lose what you
2JN.1.9	Any one who goes ahead and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God; he who abides in the doctrine has both the Father and the Son. 
2JN.1.10	If any one comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into the house or give him any greeting; 
2JN.1.11	for he who greets him shares his wicked work.
2JN.1.13	The children of your elect sister greet you.
3JN.1.2	Beloved, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in health; I know that it is well with your soul. 
3JN.1.3	For I greatly rejoiced when some of the brethren arrived and testified to the truth of your life, as indeed you do follow the truth. 
3JN.1.4	No greater joy can I have than this, to hear that my children follow the truth.
3JN.1.5	Beloved, it is a loyal thing you do when you render any service to the brethren, especially to strangers, 
3JN.1.6	who have testified to your love before the church. You will do well to send them on their journey as befits God's service. 
3JN.1.7	For they have set out for his sake and have accepted nothing from the heathen. 
3JN.1.8	So we ought to support such men, that we may be fellow workers in the truth.
3JN.1.9	I have written something to the church; but Diotrephes, who likes to put himself first, does not acknowledge my authority. 
3JN.1.10	So if I come, I will bring up what he is doing, prating against me with evil words. And not content with that, he refuses himself to welcome the brethren, and also stops those who want to welcome them and puts them out of the church.
3JN.1.11	Beloved, do not imitate evil but imitate good. He who does good is of God; he who does evil has not seen God. 
3JN.1.12	 Demetrius has testimony from every one, and from the truth itself; I testify to him too, and you know my testimony is true.
3JN.1.14	I hope to see you soon, and we will talk together face to face.
3JN.1.15	Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends, every one of them.
JUD.1.1	Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James,
JUD.1.1	To those who are called, beloved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ:
JUD.1.2	May mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you.
JUD.1.3	Beloved, being very eager to write to you of our common salvation, I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints. 
JUD.1.4	 For admission has been secretly gained by some who long ago were designated for this condemnation, ungodly persons who pervert the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
JUD.1.5	Now I desire to remind you, though you were once for all fully informed, that he
JUD.1.6	And the angels that did not keep their own position but left their proper dwelling have been kept by him in eternal chains in the nether gloom until the judgment of the great day; 
JUD.1.7	 just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise acted immorally and indulged in unnatural lust, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire.
JUD.1.8	Yet in like manner these men in their dreamings defile the flesh, reject authority, and revile the glorious ones.
JUD.1.9	 But when the archangel Michael, contending with the devil, disputed about the body of Moses, he did not presume to pronounce a reviling judgment upon him, but said, “The Lord rebuke you.” 
JUD.1.10	But these men revile whatever they do not understand, and by those things that they know by instinct as irrational animals do, they are destroyed. 
JUD.1.11	 Woe to them! For they walk in the way of Cain, and abandon themselves for the sake of gain to Balaam's error, and perish in Korah's rebellion. 
JUD.1.12	These are blemishes
JUD.1.13	wild waves of the sea, casting up the foam of their own shame; wandering stars for whom the nether gloom of darkness has been reserved for ever.
JUD.1.15	to execute judgment on all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their deeds of ungodliness which they have committed in such an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.” 
JUD.1.16	These are grumblers, malcontents, following their own passions, loud-mouthed boasters, flattering people to gain advantage.
JUD.1.17	But you must remember, beloved, the predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; 
JUD.1.18	they said to you, “In the last time there will be scoffers, following their own ungodly passions.” 
JUD.1.19	It is these who set up divisions, worldly people, devoid of the Spirit. 
JUD.1.20	But you, beloved, build yourselves up on your most holy faith; pray in the Holy Spirit; 
JUD.1.21	keep yourselves in the love of God; wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. 
JUD.1.22	And convince some, who doubt; 
JUD.1.23	 save some, by snatching them out of the fire; on some have mercy with fear, hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.
JUD.1.24	Now to him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you without blemish before the presence of his glory with rejoicing, 
JUD.1.25	to the only God, our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and now and for ever. Amen.
REV.1.1	The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his servants what must soon take place; and he made it known by sending his angel to his servant John, 
REV.1.2	who bore witness to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, even to all that he saw. 
REV.1.3	Blessed is he who reads aloud the words of the prophecy, and blessed are those who hear, and who keep what is written therein; for the time is near.
REV.1.4	Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne, 
REV.1.5	 and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the first-born of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth.
REV.1.5	To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood 
REV.1.6	 and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. 
REV.1.7	 Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, every one who pierced him; and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him. Even so. Amen.
REV.1.9	I John, your brother, who share with you in Jesus the tribulation and the kingdom and the patient endurance, was on the island called Patmos on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. 
REV.1.10	I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet 
REV.1.11	saying, “Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to La-odicea.”
REV.1.12	Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me, and on turning I saw seven golden lampstands, 
REV.1.13	 and in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man, clothed with a long robe and with a golden girdle round his breast; 
REV.1.14	his head and his hair were white as white wool, white as snow; his eyes were like a flame of fire, 
REV.1.15	 his feet were like burnished bronze, refined as in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of many waters; 
REV.1.16	 in his right hand he held seven stars, from his mouth issued a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in full strength.
REV.1.18	and the living one; I died, and behold I am alive for evermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades. 
REV.1.19	Now write what you see, what is and what is to take place hereafter. 
REV.1.20	As for the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands, the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.
REV.2.1	“To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: ‘The words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks among the seven golden lampstands.
REV.2.2	“ ‘I know your works, your toil and your patient endurance, and how you cannot bear evil men but have tested those who call themselves apostles but are not, and found them to be false; 
REV.2.3	I know you are enduring patiently and bearing up for my name's sake, and you have not grown weary. 
REV.2.4	But I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first. 
REV.2.5	Remember then from what you have fallen, repent and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent. 
REV.2.6	Yet this you have, you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. 
REV.2.7	 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.’
REV.2.9	“ ‘I know your tribulation and your poverty (but you are rich) and the slander of those who say that they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan. 
REV.2.10	 Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and for ten days you will have tribulation. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life. 
REV.2.11	He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who conquers shall not be hurt by the second death.’
REV.2.12	“And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: ‘The words of him who has the sharp two-edged sword.
REV.2.13	“ ‘I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is; you hold fast my name and you did not deny my faith even in the days of Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells. 
REV.2.14	 But I have a few things against you: you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, that they might eat food sacrificed to idols and practice immorality. 
REV.2.15	So you also have some who hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans. 
REV.2.16	Repent then. If not, I will come to you soon and war against them with the sword of my mouth. 
REV.2.17	 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who conquers I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, with a new name written on the stone which no one knows except him who receives it.’
REV.2.19	“ ‘I know your works, your love and faith and service and patient endurance, and that your latter works exceed the first. 
REV.2.20	 But I have this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess and is teaching and beguiling my servants to practice immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols. 
REV.2.21	I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her immorality. 
REV.2.22	Behold, I will throw her on a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her I will throw into great tribulation, unless they repent of her doings; 
REV.2.23	 and I will strike her children dead. And all the churches shall know that I am he who searches mind and heart, and I will give to each of you as your works deserve. 
REV.2.24	But to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who have not learned what some call the deep things of Satan, to you I say, I do not lay upon you any other burden; 
REV.2.25	only hold fast what you have, until I come. 
REV.2.26	 He who conquers and who keeps my works until the end, I will give him power over the nations, 
REV.2.27	and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as when earthen pots are broken in pieces, even as I myself have received power from my Father; 
REV.2.28	and I will give him the morning star. 
REV.2.29	He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’
REV.3.1	“And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: ‘The words of him who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars.
REV.3.1	“ ‘I know your works; you have the name of being alive, and you are dead. 
REV.3.2	Awake, and strengthen what remains and is on the point of death, for I have not found your works perfect in the sight of my God. 
REV.3.3	Remember then what you received and heard; keep that, and repent. If you will not awake, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come upon you. 
REV.3.4	Yet you have still a few names in Sardis, people who have not soiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy. 
REV.3.5	 He who conquers shall be clad thus in white garments, and I will not blot his name out of the book of life; I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels. 
REV.3.6	He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’
REV.3.8	“ ‘I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut; I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name. 
REV.3.9	 Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie—behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet, and learn that I have loved you. 
REV.3.10	Because you have kept my word of patient endurance, I will keep you from the hour of trial which is coming on the whole world, to try those who dwell upon the earth. 
REV.3.11	I am coming soon; hold fast what you have, so that no one may seize your crown. 
REV.3.12	 He who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God; never shall he go out of it, and I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem which comes down from my God out of heaven, and my own new name. 
REV.3.13	He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’
REV.3.15	“ ‘I know your works: you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were cold or hot! 
REV.3.16	So, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew you out of my mouth. 
REV.3.17	 For you say, I am rich, I have prospered, and I need nothing; not knowing that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked. 
REV.3.18	Therefore I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire, that you may be rich, and white garments to clothe you and to keep the shame of your nakedness from being seen, and salve to anoint your eyes, that you may see. 
REV.3.19	 Those whom I love, I reprove and chasten; so be zealous and repent. 
REV.3.20	Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any one hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me. 
REV.3.21	He who conquers, I will grant him to sit with me on my throne, as I myself conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne. 
REV.3.22	He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’ ”
REV.4.2	 At once I was in the Spirit, and lo, a throne stood in heaven, with one seated on the throne! 
REV.4.3	And he who sat there appeared like jasper and carnelian, and round the throne was a rainbow that looked like an emerald. 
REV.4.4	Round the throne were twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders, clad in white garments, with golden crowns upon their heads. 
REV.4.5	 From the throne issue flashes of lightning, and voices and peals of thunder, and before the throne burn seven torches of fire, which are the seven spirits of God; 
REV.4.6	 and before the throne there is as it were a sea of glass, like crystal.
REV.4.6	And round the throne, on each side of the throne, are four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind: 
REV.4.7	 the first living creature like a lion, the second living creature like an ox, the third living creature with the face of a man, and the fourth living creature like a flying eagle. 
REV.4.8	 And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all round and within, and day and night they never cease to sing,
REV.4.8	“Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty,
REV.4.8	who was and is and is to come!”
REV.4.10	the twenty-four elders fall down before him who is seated on the throne and worship him who lives for ever and ever; they cast their crowns before the throne, singing,
REV.4.11	“Worthy art thou, our Lord and God,
REV.4.11	to receive glory and honor and power,
REV.4.11	for thou didst create all things,
REV.4.11	and by thy will they existed and were created.”
REV.5.2	and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?” 
REV.5.3	And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it, 
REV.5.4	and I wept much that no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it. 
REV.5.5	 Then one of the elders said to me, “Weep not; lo, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals.”
REV.5.7	and he went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne. 
REV.5.8	 And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and with golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints; 
REV.5.9	 and they sang a new song, saying,
REV.5.9	“Worthy art thou to take the scroll and to open its seals,
REV.5.9	for thou wast slain and by thy blood didst ransom men for God
REV.5.9	from every tribe and tongue and people and nation,
REV.5.10	and they shall reign on earth.”
REV.5.12	saying with a loud voice, “Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing!” 
REV.5.13	And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and all therein, saying, “To him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might for ever and ever!” 
REV.5.14	And the four living creatures said, “Amen!” and the elders fell down and worshiped.
REV.6.1	Now I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures say, as with a voice of thunder, “Come!” 
REV.6.2	 And I saw, and behold, a white horse, and its rider had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer.
REV.6.3	When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, “Come!” 
REV.6.4	And out came another horse, bright red; its rider was permitted to take peace from the earth, so that men should slay one another; and he was given a great sword.
REV.6.5	When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Come!” And I saw, and behold, a black horse, and its rider had a balance in his hand; 
REV.6.6	 and I heard what seemed to be a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius,
REV.6.7	When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come!” 
REV.6.8	 And I saw, and behold, a pale horse, and its rider's name was Death, and Hades followed him; and they were given power over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by wild beasts of the earth.
REV.6.9	When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the witness they had borne; 
REV.6.10	 they cried out with a loud voice, “O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before thou wilt judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell upon the earth?” 
REV.6.11	Then they were each given a white robe and told to rest a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brethren should be complete, who were to be killed as they themselves had been.
REV.6.13	 and the stars of the sky fell to the earth as the fig tree sheds its winter fruit when shaken by a gale; 
REV.6.14	the sky vanished like a scroll that is rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place. 
REV.6.15	 Then the kings of the earth and the great men and the generals and the rich and the strong, and every one, slave and free, hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains, 
REV.6.16	 calling to the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb; 
REV.6.17	 for the great day of their wrath has come, and who can stand before it?”
REV.7.2	Then I saw another angel ascend from the rising of the sun, with the seal of the living God, and he called with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm earth and sea, 
REV.7.3	 saying, “Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God upon their foreheads.” 
REV.7.4	And I heard the number of the sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand sealed, out of every tribe of the sons of Israel, 
REV.7.5	twelve thousand sealed out of the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand of the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand of the tribe of Gad, 
REV.7.6	twelve thousand of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand of the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand of the tribe of Manasseh, 
REV.7.7	twelve thousand of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand of the tribe of Issachar, 
REV.7.8	twelve thousand of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand sealed out of the tribe of Benjamin.
REV.7.9	After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no man could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands, 
REV.7.10	and crying out with a loud voice, “Salvation belongs to our God who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb!” 
REV.7.11	And all the angels stood round the throne and round the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, 
REV.7.12	saying, “Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God for ever and ever! Amen.”
REV.7.13	Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, “Who are these, clothed in white robes, and whence have they come?” 
REV.7.14	 I said to him, “Sir, you know.” And he said to me, “These are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
REV.7.15	Therefore are they before the throne of God,
REV.7.15	and serve him day and night within his temple;
REV.7.15	and he who sits upon the throne will shelter them with his presence.
REV.7.16	the sun shall not strike them, nor any scorching heat.
REV.7.17	and he will guide them to springs of living water;
REV.7.17	and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.”
REV.8.1	When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. 
REV.8.2	Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. 
REV.8.3	 And another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer; and he was given much incense to mingle with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar before the throne; 
REV.8.4	and the smoke of the incense rose with the prayers of the saints from the hand of the angel before God. 
REV.8.5	 Then the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth; and there were peals of thunder, voices, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.
REV.8.6	Now the seven angels who had the seven trumpets made ready to blow them.
REV.8.9	and a third of the sea became blood, a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
REV.8.11	The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died of the water, because it was made bitter.
REV.8.12	The fourth angel blew his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of their light was darkened; a third of the day was kept from shining, and likewise a third of the night.
REV.8.13	Then I looked, and I heard an eagle crying with a loud voice, as it flew in midheaven, “Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, at the blasts of the other trumpets which the three angels are about to blow!”
REV.9.1	And the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star fallen from heaven to earth, and he was given the key of the shaft of the bottomless pit; 
REV.9.2	 he opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and from the shaft rose smoke like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke from the shaft. 
REV.9.3	 Then from the smoke came locusts on the earth, and they were given power like the power of scorpions of the earth; 
REV.9.4	 they were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any green growth or any tree, but only those of mankind who have not the seal of God upon their foreheads; 
REV.9.5	they were allowed to torture them for five months, but not to kill them, and their torture was like the torture of a scorpion, when it stings a man. 
REV.9.6	 And in those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, and death will fly from them.
REV.9.8	 their hair like women's hair, and their teeth like lions' teeth; 
REV.9.9	 they had scales like iron breastplates, and the noise of their wings was like the noise of many chariots with horses rushing into battle. 
REV.9.10	They have tails like scorpions, and stings, and their power of hurting men for five months lies in their tails. 
REV.9.11	They have as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek he is called Apollyon.
REV.9.12	The first woe has passed; behold, two woes are still to come.
REV.9.14	saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.” 
REV.9.15	So the four angels were released, who had been held ready for the hour, the day, the month, and the year, to kill a third of mankind. 
REV.9.16	The number of the troops of cavalry was twice ten thousand times ten thousand; I heard their number. 
REV.9.17	And this was how I saw the horses in my vision: the riders wore breastplates the color of fire and of sapphire
REV.9.18	By these three plagues a third of mankind was killed, by the fire and smoke and sulphur issuing from their mouths. 
REV.9.19	For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; their tails are like serpents, with heads, and by means of them they wound.
REV.9.21	nor did they repent of their murders or their sorceries or their immorality or their thefts.
REV.10.1	Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, with a rainbow over his head, and his face was like the sun, and his legs like pillars of fire. 
REV.10.2	He had a little scroll open in his hand. And he set his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the land, 
REV.10.3	and called out with a loud voice, like a lion roaring; when he called out, the seven thunders sounded. 
REV.10.4	And when the seven thunders had sounded, I was about to write, but I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and do not write it down.” 
REV.10.5	 And the angel whom I saw standing on sea and land lifted up his right hand to heaven 
REV.10.6	and swore by him who lives for ever and ever, who created heaven and what is in it, the earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it, that there should be no more delay, 
REV.10.7	but that in the days of the trumpet call to be sounded by the seventh angel, the mystery of God, as he announced to his servants the prophets, should be fulfilled.
REV.10.8	Then the voice which I had heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, “Go, take the scroll which is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.” 
REV.10.9	 So I went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll; and he said to me, “Take it and eat; it will be bitter to your stomach, but sweet as honey in your mouth.” 
REV.10.10	And I took the little scroll from the hand of the angel and ate it; it was sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it my stomach was made bitter. 
REV.10.11	 And I was told, “You must again prophesy about many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.”
REV.11.2	 but do not measure the court outside the temple; leave that out, for it is given over to the nations, and they will trample over the holy city for forty-two months. 
REV.11.3	And I will grant my two witnesses power to prophesy for one thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.”
REV.11.5	 And if any one would harm them, fire pours from their mouth and consumes their foes; if any one would harm them, thus he is doomed to be killed. 
REV.11.6	 They have power to shut the sky, that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying, and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every plague, as often as they desire. 
REV.11.7	 And when they have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends from the bottomless pit will make war upon them and conquer them and kill them, 
REV.11.8	 and their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city which is allegorically
REV.11.9	For three days and a half men from the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations gaze at their dead bodies and refuse to let them be placed in a tomb, 
REV.11.10	and those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and make merry and exchange presents, because these two prophets had been a torment to those who dwell on the earth. 
REV.11.11	 But after the three and a half days a breath of life from God entered them, and they stood up on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them. 
REV.11.12	 Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up hither!” And in the sight of their foes they went up to heaven in a cloud. 
REV.11.13	And at that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell; seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
REV.11.14	The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is soon to come.
REV.11.16	And the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshiped God, 
REV.11.17	saying,
REV.11.17	“We give thanks to thee, Lord God Almighty, who art and who wast,
REV.11.17	that thou hast taken thy great power and begun to reign.
REV.11.18	and the time for the dead to be judged,
REV.11.18	for rewarding thy servants, the prophets and saints,
REV.11.18	and those who fear thy name, both small and great,
REV.11.18	and for destroying the destroyers of the earth.”
REV.12.1	And a great portent appeared in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars; 
REV.12.2	 she was with child and she cried out in her pangs of birth, in anguish for delivery. 
REV.12.3	 And another portent appeared in heaven; behold, a great red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems upon his heads. 
REV.12.4	 His tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bear a child, that he might devour her child when she brought it forth; 
REV.12.5	 she brought forth a male child, one who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron, but her child was caught up to God and to his throne, 
REV.12.6	and the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, in which to be nourished for one thousand two hundred and sixty days.
REV.12.8	but they were defeated and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. 
REV.12.9	 And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world—he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. 
REV.12.10	 And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, “Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down, who accuses them day and night before our God. 
REV.12.11	And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death. 
REV.12.12	 Rejoice then, O heaven and you that dwell therein! But woe to you, O earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you in great wrath, because he knows that his time is short!”
REV.12.13	And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had borne the male child. 
REV.12.14	 But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle that she might fly from the serpent into the wilderness, to the place where she is to be nourished for a time, and times, and half a time. 
REV.12.15	The serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, to sweep her away with the flood. 
REV.12.16	But the earth came to the help of the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river which the dragon had poured from his mouth. 
REV.12.17	Then the dragon was angry with the woman, and went off to make war on the rest of her offspring, on those who keep the commandments of God and bear testimony to Jesus. And he stood
REV.13.2	And the beast that I saw was like a leopard, its feet were like a bear's, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth. And to it the dragon gave his power and his throne and great authority. 
REV.13.3	One of its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its mortal wound was healed, and the whole earth followed the beast with wonder. 
REV.13.4	Men worshiped the dragon, for he had given his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast, and who can fight against it?”
REV.13.6	it opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name and his dwelling, that is, those who dwell in heaven. 
REV.13.7	 Also it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them.
REV.13.8	and all who dwell on earth will worship it, every one whose name has not been written before the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb that was slain. 
REV.13.9	 If any one has an ear, let him hear:
REV.13.10	to captivity he goes;
REV.13.10	if any one slays with the sword,
REV.13.10	with the sword must he be slain.
REV.13.10	Here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints.
REV.13.11	Then I saw another beast which rose out of the earth; it had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon. 
REV.13.12	It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence, and makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose mortal wound was healed. 
REV.13.13	It works great signs, even making fire come down from heaven to earth in the sight of men; 
REV.13.14	 and by the signs which it is allowed to work in the presence of the beast, it deceives those who dwell on earth, bidding them make an image for the beast which was wounded by the sword and yet lived; 
REV.13.15	 and it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast should even speak, and to cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be slain. 
REV.13.16	Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, 
REV.13.17	so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name. 
REV.13.18	This calls for wisdom: let him who has understanding reckon the number of the beast, for it is a human number, its number is six hundred and sixty-six.
REV.14.2	And I heard a voice from heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder; the voice I heard was like the sound of harpers playing on their harps, 
REV.14.3	and they sing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders. No one could learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from the earth. 
REV.14.4	It is these who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are chaste;
REV.14.5	and in their mouth no lie was found, for they are spotless.
REV.14.6	Then I saw another angel flying in midheaven, with an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on earth, to every nation and tribe and tongue and people; 
REV.14.7	and he said with a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, for the hour of his judgment has come; and worship him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the fountains of water.”
REV.14.9	And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If any one worships the beast and its image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, 
REV.14.10	 he also shall drink the wine of God's wrath, poured unmixed into the cup of his anger, and he shall be tormented with fire and sulphur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. 
REV.14.11	 And the smoke of their torment goes up for ever and ever; and they have no rest, day or night, these worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.”
REV.14.12	Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.
REV.14.13	And I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord henceforth.” “Blessed indeed,” says the Spirit, “that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them!”
REV.14.15	 And another angel came out of the temple, calling with a loud voice to him who sat upon the cloud, “Put in your sickle, and reap, for the hour to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is fully ripe.” 
REV.14.16	So he who sat upon the cloud swung his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.
REV.14.17	And another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle. 
REV.14.18	Then another angel came out from the altar, the angel who has power over fire, and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, “Put in your sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for its grapes are ripe.” 
REV.14.19	So the angel swung his sickle on the earth and gathered the vintage of the earth, and threw it into the great wine press of the wrath of God; 
REV.14.20	 and the wine press was trodden outside the city, and blood flowed from the wine press, as high as a horse's bridle, for one thousand six hundred stadia.
REV.15.2	And I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name, standing beside the sea of glass with harps of God in their hands. 
REV.15.3	 And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying,
REV.15.3	“Great and wonderful are thy deeds,
REV.15.3	O Lord God the Almighty!
REV.15.3	Just and true are thy ways,
REV.15.3	O King of the ages!
REV.15.4	For thou alone art holy.
REV.15.4	All nations shall come and worship thee,
REV.15.4	for thy judgments have been revealed.”
REV.15.6	and out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues, robed in pure bright linen, and their breasts girded with golden girdles. 
REV.15.7	And one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God who lives for ever and ever; 
REV.15.8	 and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were ended.
REV.16.4	The third angel poured his bowl into the rivers and the fountains of water, and they became blood. 
REV.16.5	And I heard the angel of water say,
REV.16.5	“Just art thou in these thy judgments,
REV.16.5	thou who art and wast, O Holy One.
REV.16.6	and thou hast given them blood to drink.
REV.16.6	It is their due!”
REV.16.7	“Yea, Lord God the Almighty,
REV.16.7	true and just are thy judgments!”
REV.16.8	The fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun, and it was allowed to scorch men with fire; 
REV.16.9	men were scorched by the fierce heat, and they cursed the name of God who had power over these plagues, and they did not repent and give him glory.
REV.16.11	and cursed the God of heaven for their pain and sores, and did not repent of their deeds.
REV.16.13	 And I saw, issuing from the mouth of the dragon and from the mouth of the beast and from the mouth of the false prophet, three foul spirits like frogs; 
REV.16.14	for they are demonic spirits, performing signs, who go abroad to the kings of the whole world, to assemble them for battle on the great day of God the Almighty. 
REV.16.15	 (“Lo, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is he who is awake, keeping his garments that he may not go naked and be seen exposed!”) 
REV.16.16	 And they assembled them at the place which is called in Hebrew Armageddon.
REV.16.18	 And there were flashes of lightning, voices, peals of thunder, and a great earthquake such as had never been since men were on the earth, so great was that earthquake. 
REV.16.19	The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell, and God remembered great Babylon, to make her drain the cup of the fury of his wrath. 
REV.16.20	And every island fled away, and no mountains were to be found; 
REV.16.21	 and great hailstones, heavy as a hundredweight, dropped on men from heaven, till men cursed God for the plague of the hail, so fearful was that plague.
REV.17.2	 with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and with the wine of whose fornication the dwellers on earth have become drunk.” 
REV.17.3	And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast which was full of blasphemous names, and it had seven heads and ten horns. 
REV.17.4	 The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and bedecked with gold and jewels and pearls, holding in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her fornication; 
REV.17.5	and on her forehead was written a name of mystery: “Babylon the great, mother of harlots and of earth's abominations.” 
REV.17.6	And I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.
REV.17.6	When I saw her I marveled greatly. 
REV.17.7	But the angel said to me, “Why marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her. 
REV.17.8	 The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is to ascend from the bottomless pit and go to perdition; and the dwellers on earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will marvel to behold the beast, because it was and is not and is to come. 
REV.17.9	This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated; 
REV.17.10	they are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he comes he must remain only a little while. 
REV.17.11	As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven, and it goes to perdition. 
REV.17.12	 And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received royal power, but they are to receive authority as kings for one hour, together with the beast. 
REV.17.13	These are of one mind and give over their power and authority to the beast; 
REV.17.14	 they will make war on the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with him are called and chosen and faithful.”
REV.17.15	And he said to me, “The waters that you saw, where the harlot is seated, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues. 
REV.17.16	And the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast will hate the harlot; they will make her desolate and naked, and devour her flesh and burn her up with fire, 
REV.17.17	for God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by being of one mind and giving over their royal power to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled. 
REV.17.18	And the woman that you saw is the great city which has dominion over the kings of the earth.”
REV.18.1	After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority; and the earth was made bright with his splendor. 
REV.18.2	 And he called out with a mighty voice,
REV.18.2	“Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great!
REV.18.2	It has become a dwelling place of demons,
REV.18.2	a haunt of every foul spirit,
REV.18.2	a haunt of every foul and hateful bird;
REV.18.3	and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her,
REV.18.3	and the merchants of the earth have grown rich with the wealth of her wantonness.”
REV.18.4	“Come out of her, my people,
REV.18.4	lest you take part in her sins,
REV.18.4	lest you share in her plagues;
REV.18.5	and God has remembered her iniquities.
REV.18.6	and repay her double for her deeds;
REV.18.6	mix a double draught for her in the cup she mixed.
REV.18.7	so give her a like measure of torment and mourning.
REV.18.7	Since in her heart she says, ‘A queen I sit,
REV.18.7	I am no widow, mourning I shall never see,’
REV.18.8	so shall her plagues come in a single day,
REV.18.8	pestilence and mourning and famine,
REV.18.8	and she shall be burned with fire;
REV.18.8	for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.”
REV.18.10	they will stand far off, in fear of her torment, and say,
REV.18.10	“Alas! alas! thou great city,
REV.18.10	thou mighty city, Babylon!
REV.18.10	In one hour has thy judgment come.”
REV.18.12	 cargo of gold, silver, jewels and pearls, fine linen, purple, silk and scarlet, all kinds of scented wood, all articles of ivory, all articles of costly wood, bronze, iron and marble, 
REV.18.13	cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, oil, fine flour and wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and chariots, and slaves, that is, human souls.
REV.18.14	“The fruit for which thy soul longed has gone from thee,
REV.18.14	and all thy dainties and thy splendor are lost to thee, never to be found again!”
REV.18.16	“Alas, alas, for the great city
REV.18.16	that was clothed in fine linen, in purple and scarlet,
REV.18.16	bedecked with gold, with jewels, and with pearls!
REV.18.17	And all shipmasters and seafaring men, sailors and all whose trade is on the sea, stood far off 
REV.18.18	and cried out as they saw the smoke of her burning,
REV.18.18	“What city was like the great city?”
REV.18.19	“Alas, alas, for the great city
REV.18.19	where all who had ships at sea grew rich by her wealth!
REV.18.19	In one hour she has been laid waste.
REV.18.20	O saints and apostles and prophets,
REV.18.20	for God has given judgment for you against her!”
REV.18.21	“So shall Babylon the great city be thrown down with violence,
REV.18.21	and shall be found no more;
REV.18.22	shall be heard in thee no more;
REV.18.22	and a craftsman of any craft
REV.18.22	shall be found in thee no more;
REV.18.22	and the sound of the millstone
REV.18.22	shall be heard in thee no more;
REV.18.23	shall shine in thee no more;
REV.18.23	and the voice of bridegroom and bride
REV.18.23	shall be heard in thee no more;
REV.18.23	for thy merchants were the great men of the earth,
REV.18.23	and all nations were deceived by thy sorcery.
REV.18.24	and of all who have been slain on earth.”
REV.19.1	After this I heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, crying,
REV.19.1	“Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God,
REV.19.2	he has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication,
REV.19.2	and he has avenged on her the blood of his servants.”
REV.19.3	“Hallelujah! The smoke from her goes up for ever and ever.”
REV.19.4	And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who is seated on the throne, saying, “Amen. Hallelujah!” 
REV.19.5	 And from the throne came a voice crying,
REV.19.5	“Praise our God, all you his servants,
REV.19.5	you who fear him, small and great.”
REV.19.6	Then I heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude, like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunderpeals, crying,
REV.19.6	“Hallelujah! For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns.
REV.19.7	for the marriage of the Lamb has come,
REV.19.7	and his Bride has made herself ready;
REV.19.8	it was granted her to be clothed with fine linen, bright and pure”—
REV.19.8	for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.
REV.19.9	And the angel said
REV.19.10	Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, “You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brethren who hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God.” For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
REV.19.12	 His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems; and he has a name inscribed which no one knows but himself. 
REV.19.13	He is clad in a robe dipped in
REV.19.14	And the armies of heaven, arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, followed him on white horses. 
REV.19.15	 From his mouth issues a sharp sword with which to smite the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron; he will tread the wine press of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. 
REV.19.16	 On his robe and on his thigh he has a name inscribed, King of kings and Lord of lords.
REV.19.18	to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, both small and great.” 
REV.19.19	And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against him who sits upon the horse and against his army. 
REV.19.20	And the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who in its presence had worked the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulphur. 
REV.19.21	And the rest were slain by the sword of him who sits upon the horse, the sword that issues from his mouth; and all the birds were gorged with their flesh.
REV.20.1	Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain. 
REV.20.2	And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, 
REV.20.3	and threw him into the pit, and shut it and sealed it over him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years were ended. After that he must be loosed for a little while.
REV.20.5	The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection. 
REV.20.6	Blessed and holy is he who shares in the first resurrection! Over such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and they shall reign with him a thousand years.
REV.20.7	And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be loosed from his prison 
REV.20.8	 and will come out to deceive the nations which are at the four corners of the earth, that is, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea. 
REV.20.9	 And they marched up over the broad earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city; but fire came down from heaven
REV.20.10	and the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulphur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
REV.20.12	And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Also another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, by what they had done. 
REV.20.13	And the sea gave up the dead in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead in them, and all were judged by what they had done. 
REV.20.14	Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire; 
REV.20.15	 and if any one's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.
REV.21.2	 And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband; 
REV.21.3	 and I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling of God is with men. He will dwell with them, and they shall be his people,
REV.21.4	 he will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain any more, for the former things have passed away.”
REV.21.6	 And he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the fountain of the water of life without payment. 
REV.21.7	 He who conquers shall have this heritage, and I will be his God and he shall be my son. 
REV.21.8	 But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted, as for murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their lot shall be in the lake that burns with fire and sulphur, which is the second death.”
REV.21.9	Then came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues, and spoke to me, saying, “Come, I will show you the Bride, the wife of the Lamb.” 
REV.21.10	 And in the Spirit he carried me away to a great, high mountain, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God, 
REV.21.11	having the glory of God, its radiance like a most rare jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal. 
REV.21.12	 It had a great, high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel were inscribed; 
REV.21.13	on the east three gates, on the north three gates, on the south three gates, and on the west three gates. 
REV.21.14	And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
REV.21.16	The city lies foursquare, its length the same as its breadth; and he measured the city with his rod, twelve thousand stadia;
REV.21.17	He also measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits by a man's measure, that is, an angel's. 
REV.21.18	The wall was built of jasper, while the city was pure gold, clear as glass. 
REV.21.19	 The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every jewel; the first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald, 
REV.21.20	the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst. 
REV.21.21	And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates made of a single pearl, and the street of the city was pure gold, transparent as glass.
REV.21.22	And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb. 
REV.21.23	 And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine upon it, for the glory of God is its light, and its lamp is the Lamb. 
REV.21.24	By its light shall the nations walk; and the kings of the earth shall bring their glory into it, 
REV.21.25	 and its gates shall never be shut by day—and there shall be no night there; 
REV.21.26	they shall bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations. 
REV.21.27	 But nothing unclean shall enter it, nor any one who practices abomination or falsehood, but only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life.
REV.22.1	Then he showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb 
REV.22.2	 through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life
REV.22.3	 There shall no more be anything accursed, but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall worship him; 
REV.22.4	 they shall see his face, and his name shall be on their foreheads. 
REV.22.5	And night shall be no more; they need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they shall reign for ever and ever.
REV.22.6	And he said to me, “These words are trustworthy and true. And the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his servants what must soon take place. 
REV.22.7	And behold, I am coming soon.”
REV.22.7	Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.
REV.22.8	I John am he who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to me; 
REV.22.9	but he said to me, “You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brethren the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book. Worship God.”
REV.22.10	And he said to me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near. 
REV.22.11	 Let the evildoer still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy, and the righteous still do right, and the holy still be holy.”
REV.22.13	 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.”
REV.22.15	Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and fornicators and murderers and idolaters, and every one who loves and practices falsehood.
REV.22.18	I warn every one who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if any one adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, 
REV.22.19	and if any one takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.
REV.22.20	He who testifies to these things says, “Surely I am coming soon.” Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!
