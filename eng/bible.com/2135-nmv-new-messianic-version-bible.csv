GEN.17.16	And I will bless her, and give you
GEN.17.17	Then Avraham 
GEN.17.18	And Avraham 
GEN.17.19	And God-Elōhīm 
GEN.17.20	And as for Yishma’el (He Will Hear God; God hears 
GEN.17.21	But my covenant will I establish with Yitz’chak 
GEN.17.22	And he left off talking with him, and God-Elōhīm 
GEN.17.23	And Avraham 
GEN.17.24	And Avraham 
GEN.17.25	And Yishma’el 
GEN.17.26	In the selfsame day was Avraham 
GEN.17.27	And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.
GEN.18.1	And the 
GEN.18.2	And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw 
GEN.18.3	And said, My Lord-Adonai 
GEN.18.4	Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash yourf feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:
GEN.18.5	And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort you
GEN.18.6	And Avraham 
GEN.18.7	And Avraham 
GEN.18.8	And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set 
GEN.18.9	And they said unto him, Where 
GEN.18.10	And he said, I will certainly return unto you
GEN.18.11	Now Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] and Sarah 
GEN.18.12	Therefore Sarah 
GEN.18.13	And the 
GEN.18.14	Is anything too hard for the 
GEN.18.15	Then Sarah 
GEN.18.16	And the men rose up from there, and looked toward S’dom 
GEN.18.17	And the 
GEN.18.18	Seeing that Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be Blessed 
GEN.18.19	For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the 
GEN.18.20	And the 
GEN.18.21	I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
GEN.18.22	And the men turned their faces from there, and went toward S’dom 
GEN.18.23	And Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] drew near, and said, Will you
GEN.18.24	Perhaps there be fifty righteous within the city: will you
GEN.18.25	That be far from you
GEN.18.26	And the 
GEN.18.27	And Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord-Adonai 
GEN.18.28	Perhaps there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: will you
GEN.18.29	And he spoke unto him yet again, and said, Perhaps there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do 
GEN.18.30	And he said 
GEN.18.31	And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord-Adonai 
GEN.18.32	And he said, Oh let not the Lord-Adonai (Greatest Above All) GOD-Yehōvih 
GEN.18.33	And the 
GEN.19.1	And there came two angels to S’dom 
GEN.19.2	And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into yourf servant’s house, and wait all night, and wash yourf feet, and you
GEN.19.3	And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
GEN.19.4	But before they lay down, the men of the city, 
GEN.19.5	And they called unto Lot 
GEN.19.6	And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,
GEN.19.7	And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.
GEN.19.8	Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do you
GEN.19.9	And they said, Stand back. And they said 
GEN.19.10	But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
GEN.19.11	And they struck the men that 
GEN.19.12	And the men said unto Lot, Have you
GEN.19.13	For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the 
GEN.19.14	And Lot went out, and spoke unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you
GEN.19.15	And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take your
GEN.19.16	And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the 
GEN.19.17	And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for your
GEN.19.18	And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord 
GEN.19.19	Behold now, your
GEN.19.20	Behold now, this city 
GEN.19.21	And he said unto him, See, I have accepted you
GEN.19.22	Haste you
GEN.19.23	The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot 
GEN.19.24	Then the 
GEN.19.25	And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
GEN.19.26	But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
GEN.19.27	And Avraham 
GEN.19.28	And he looked toward S’dom 
GEN.19.29	And it came to pass, when God-Elōhīm 
GEN.19.30	And Lot went up out of Tzo’ar 
GEN.19.31	And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father 
GEN.19.32	Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
GEN.19.33	And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
GEN.19.34	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yester night with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go you
GEN.19.35	And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
GEN.19.36	In the following manner were both the daughters of Lot 
GEN.19.37	And the firstborn bore a son, and called his name Mo’av 
GEN.19.38	And the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Ben-’’Ammi 
GEN.20.1	And Avraham 
GEN.20.2	And Avraham

GEN.20.4	But Avi-melekh 
GEN.20.5	Said he not unto me, She 
GEN.20.6	And God-Elōhīm 
GEN.20.7	Now therefore restore the man 
GEN.20.8	Therefore Avi-melekh 
GEN.20.9	Then Avi-melekh called Avraham 
GEN.20.10	And Avi-melekh said unto Avraham 
GEN.20.11	And Avraham 
GEN.20.12	And yet indeed 
GEN.20.13	And it came to pass, when God-Elōhīm

GEN.20.15	And Avi-melekh 
GEN.20.16	And unto Sarah 
GEN.20.17	So Avraham

GEN.21.5	And Avraham 
GEN.21.6	And Sarah 
GEN.21.7	And she said, Who would have said unto Avraham 
GEN.21.8	And the child grew, and was weaned: and Avraham 
GEN.21.9	And Sarah 
GEN.21.10	For what reason she said unto Avraham 
GEN.21.11	And the thing was very grievous in Avraham’s 
GEN.21.12	And God-Elōhīm 
GEN.21.13	And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he

GEN.21.21	And he dwelt in the wilderness of Pa’ran 
GEN.21.22	And it came to pass at that time, that Avi-melekh 
GEN.21.23	Now therefore swear unto me here by God-Elōhīm

GEN.21.29	And Avi-melekh 
GEN.21.30	And he said, For 
GEN.21.31	For what reason he called that place Be’er-Sheva 
GEN.21.32	In the following manner they made a covenant at Be’er-Sheva 
GEN.21.33	And [Avraham 
GEN.21.34	And Avraham 
GEN.22.1	And it came to pass after these things, that God-Elōhīm

GEN.23.4	I 
GEN.23.5	And the children of Het 
GEN.23.6	Hear us, my lord: you
GEN.23.7	And Avraham 
GEN.23.8	And he communed with them, saying, If it be yourf mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and entreat for me to ‘Efron 
GEN.23.9	That he may give me the cave of Makhpelah 
GEN.23.10	And ‘Efron 
GEN.23.11	No, my lord, hear me: the field give I you
GEN.23.12	And Avraham

GEN.23.14	And ‘Efron 
GEN.23.15	My lord, hearken unto me: the land 
GEN.23.16	And Avraham 
GEN.23.17	And the field of ‘Efron

GEN.24.6	And Avraham 
GEN.24.7	The 
GEN.24.8	And if the woman will not be willing to follow you
GEN.24.9	And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Avraham 
GEN.24.10	And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master 
GEN.24.11	And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.
GEN.24.12	And he said, O 
GEN.24.13	Behold, I stand 
GEN.24.14	And let it come to pass, that the girl to whom I shall say, Let down your
GEN.24.15	And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rivkah 
GEN.24.16	And the girl 
GEN.24.17	And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray you
GEN.24.18	And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.
GEN.24.19	And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw 
GEN.24.20	And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw 
GEN.24.21	And the man wondering at her held his peace, that is to say whether the 
GEN.24.22	And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten 
GEN.24.23	And said, Whose daughter 
GEN.24.24	And she said unto him, I 
GEN.24.25	She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender 
GEN.24.26	And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the 
GEN.24.27	And he said, Blessed 
GEN.24.28	And the girl ran, and told 
GEN.24.29	And Rivkah 
GEN.24.30	And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rivkah 
GEN.24.31	And he said, Come in, you
GEN.24.32	And the man came into the house: and he unloaded his camels, and gave straw and provender 
GEN.24.33	And there was set 
GEN.24.34	And he said, I 
GEN.24.35	And the 
GEN.24.36	And Sarah 
GEN.24.37	And my master made me swear, saying, You
GEN.24.38	But you
GEN.24.39	And I said unto my master, Perhaps the woman will not follow me.
GEN.24.40	And he said unto me, The 
GEN.24.41	Then shall you
GEN.24.42	And I came this day unto the well, and said, O 
GEN.24.43	Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin comes forth to draw 
GEN.24.44	And she say to me, Both drink you
GEN.24.45	And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rivkah 
GEN.24.46	And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her 
GEN.24.47	And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter 
GEN.24.48	And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the 
GEN.24.49	And now if you

GEN.24.53	And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing, and gave 
GEN.24.54	And they did eat and drink, he and the men that 
GEN.24.55	And her brother and her mother said, Let the girl abide with us 
GEN.24.56	And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the 
GEN.24.57	And they said, We will call the girl, and enquire at her mouth.
GEN.24.58	And they called Rivkah, and said unto her, Will you
GEN.24.59	And they sent away Rivkah 
GEN.24.60	And they Blessed 
GEN.24.61	And Rivkah 
GEN.24.62	And Yitz’chak 
GEN.24.63	And Yitz’chak 
GEN.24.64	And Rivkah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Yitz’chak 
GEN.24.65	For she 
GEN.24.66	And the servant told Yitz’chak 
GEN.24.67	And Yitz’chak 
GEN.25.1	Then again Avraham 
GEN.25.2	And she bore him Zimran 
GEN.25.3	And Yokshan 
GEN.25.4	And the sons of Midyan 
GEN.25.5	And Avraham 
GEN.25.6	But unto the sons of the concubines, which Avraham

GEN.25.8	Then Avraham 
GEN.25.9	And his sons Yitz’chak

GEN.25.12	Now these 
GEN.25.13	And these 
GEN.25.14	And Mishma 
GEN.25.15	Hadad 
GEN.25.16	These 
GEN.25.17	And these 
GEN.25.18	And they dwelt from Havilah 
GEN.25.19	And these 
GEN.25.20	And Yitz’chak 
GEN.25.21	And Yitz’chak 
GEN.25.22	And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If 
GEN.25.23	And the 
GEN.25.24	And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, 
GEN.25.25	And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name ‘Esav 
GEN.25.26	And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on ‘Esav’s 
GEN.25.27	And the boys grew: and ‘Esav 
GEN.25.28	And Yitz’chak 
GEN.25.29	And Ya’akov 
GEN.25.30	And ‘Esav 
GEN.25.31	And Ya’akov said, Sell me this day your
GEN.25.32	And ‘Esav 
GEN.25.33	And Ya’akov 
GEN.25.34	Then Ya’akov gave ‘Esav 
GEN.26.1	And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Avraham 
GEN.26.2	And the 
GEN.26.3	Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you
GEN.26.4	And I will make your
GEN.26.5	Because that Avraham 
GEN.26.6	And Yitz’chak 
GEN.26.7	And the men of the place asked 
GEN.26.8	And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Avi-melekh 
GEN.26.9	And Avi-melekh called Yitz’chak 
GEN.26.10	And Avi-melekh said, What 
GEN.26.11	And Avi-melekh charged all 
GEN.26.12	Then Yitz’chak 
GEN.26.13	And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:
GEN.26.14	For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the P’lishtim 
GEN.26.15	For all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Avraham 
GEN.26.16	And Avi-melekh said unto Yitz’chak 
GEN.26.17	And Yitz’chak 
GEN.26.18	And Yitz’chak 
GEN.26.19	And Yitz’chak’s 
GEN.26.20	And the herdsmen of G’rar did strive with Yitz’chak’s 
GEN.26.21	And they dug another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah 
GEN.26.22	And he removed from there, and dug another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rekhovot 
GEN.26.23	And he went up from there to Be’er-Sheva 
GEN.26.24	And the 
GEN.26.25	And he built an altar there, and called upon the name of the 
GEN.26.26	Then Avi-melekh 
GEN.26.27	And Yitz’chak 
GEN.26.28	And they said, We saw certainly that the 
GEN.26.29	That you
GEN.26.30	And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.
GEN.26.31	And they rose up early in the morning, and swore one to another: and Yitz’chak 
GEN.26.32	And it came to pass the same day that Yitz’chak’s 
GEN.26.33	And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city 
GEN.26.34	And ‘Esav 
GEN.26.35	Which were a grief of mind unto Yitz’chak 
GEN.27.1	And it came to pass, that when Yitz’chak 
GEN.27.2	And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:
GEN.27.3	Now therefore take, I pray you
GEN.27.4	And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring 
GEN.27.5	And Rivkah 
GEN.27.6	And Rivkah 
GEN.27.7	Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless you
GEN.27.8	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you
GEN.27.9	Go now to the flock, and fetch me from there two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for your
GEN.27.10	And you
GEN.27.11	And Ya’akov 
GEN.27.12	My father perhaps will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.
GEN.27.13	And his mother said unto him, Upon me 
GEN.27.14	And he went, and fetched, and brought 
GEN.27.15	And Rivkah 
GEN.27.16	And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:
GEN.27.17	And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Ya’akov 
GEN.27.18	And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here 
GEN.27.19	And Ya’akov said unto his father, I 
GEN.27.20	And Yitz’chak 
GEN.27.21	And Yitz’chak 
GEN.27.22	And Ya’akov went near unto Yitz’chak 
GEN.27.23	And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother ‘Esav’s hands: so he Blessed 
GEN.27.24	And he said, 
GEN.27.25	And he said, Bring 
GEN.27.26	And his father Yitz’chak 
GEN.27.27	And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his clothing, and Blessed 
GEN.27.28	Therefore God-Elōhīm 
GEN.27.29	Let people serve you
GEN.27.30	And it came to pass, as soon as Yitz’chak 
GEN.27.31	And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that your
GEN.27.32	And Yitz’chak 
GEN.27.33	And Yitz’chak 
GEN.27.34	And when ‘Esav heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, 
GEN.27.35	And he said, your
GEN.27.36	And he said, Is not he rightly named Ya’akov (he who holds onto the heel of)?!? for he has supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Have you
GEN.27.37	And Yitz’chak 
GEN.27.38	And ‘Esav said unto his father, Have you
GEN.27.39	And Yitz’chak 
GEN.27.40	And by your
GEN.27.41	And ‘Esav hated Ya’akov because of the blessing which his father Blessed 
GEN.27.42	And these words of ‘Esav her elder son were told to Rivkah: and she sent and called Ya’akov her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, your
GEN.27.43	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee you
GEN.27.44	And wait with him a few days, until your
GEN.27.45	Until your
GEN.27.46	And Rivkah 
GEN.28.1	And Yitz’chak 
GEN.28.2	Arise, go to Paddan-aram 
GEN.28.3	And God-El 
GEN.28.4	And give you
GEN.28.5	And Yitz’chak 
GEN.28.6	When ‘Esav 
GEN.28.7	And that Ya’akov 
GEN.28.8	And ‘Esav 
GEN.28.9	Then went ‘Esav 
GEN.28.10	And Ya’akov 
GEN.28.11	And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put 
GEN.28.12	And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God-Elōhīm 
GEN.28.13	And, behold, the 
GEN.28.14	And your
GEN.28.15	And, behold, I 
GEN.28.16	And Ya’akov awakened out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the 
GEN.28.17	And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful 
GEN.28.18	And Ya’akov 
GEN.28.19	And he called the name of that place Beit-El 
GEN.28.20	And Ya’akov 
GEN.28.21	So that I come again to my father’s house in peace; then shall the 
GEN.28.22	And this stone, which I have set 
GEN.29.1	Then Ya’akov 
GEN.29.2	And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there 
GEN.29.3	And there were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well’s mouth in his place.
GEN.29.4	And Ya’akov said unto them, My brethren, from what place 
GEN.29.5	And he said unto them, Know you
GEN.29.6	And he said unto them, 
GEN.29.7	And he said, Lo, 
GEN.29.8	And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and 
GEN.29.9	And while he yet spoke with them, Rachel

GEN.29.11	And Ya’akov 
GEN.29.12	And Ya’akov told Rachel that he

GEN.29.14	And Lavan 
GEN.29.15	And Lavan said unto Ya’akov, Because you
GEN.29.16	And Lavan had two daughters: the name of the elder 
GEN.29.17	Le’ah 
GEN.29.18	And Ya’akov loved Rachel; and said, I will serve you
GEN.29.19	And Lavan said, 
GEN.29.20	And Ya’akov served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him 
GEN.29.21	And Ya’akov said unto Lavan, Give 
GEN.29.22	And Lavan gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
GEN.29.23	And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Le’ah 
GEN.29.24	And Lavan 
GEN.29.25	And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it 
GEN.29.26	And Lavan said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.
GEN.29.27	Fulfill her week, and we will give you
GEN.29.28	And Ya’akov 
GEN.29.29	And Lavan gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah 
GEN.29.30	And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel

GEN.30.4	And she gave him Bilhah her female servant to wife: and Ya’akov 
GEN.30.5	And Bilhah conceived, and bore Ya’akov a son.
GEN.30.6	And Rachel 
GEN.30.7	And Bilhah Rachel’s 
GEN.30.8	And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naftali 
GEN.30.9	When Le’ah 
GEN.30.10	And Zilpah 
GEN.30.11	And Le’ah 
GEN.30.12	And Zilpah, Leah’s maid bore Ya’akov a second son.
GEN.30.13	And Le’ah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me Blessed

GEN.30.22	And God-Elōhīm 
GEN.30.23	And she conceived, and bore a son; and said, God-Elōhīm 
GEN.30.24	And she called his name Yosef (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add 
GEN.30.25	And it came to pass, when Rachel 
GEN.30.26	Give 
GEN.30.27	And Lavan said unto him, I pray you
GEN.30.28	And he said, Appoint me your
GEN.30.29	And he said unto him, You
GEN.30.30	For 
GEN.30.31	And he said, What shall I give you
GEN.30.32	I will pass through all your
GEN.30.33	So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before your
GEN.30.34	And Lavan 
GEN.30.35	And he removed that day the he goats that were marked with circular stripes and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, 
GEN.30.36	And he set three days’ journey between himself and Ya’akov 
GEN.30.37	And Ya’akov took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chestnut tree; and pealed white strakes in them, and made the white appear which 
GEN.30.38	And he set the rods which he had pealed before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.
GEN.30.39	And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle marked with circular stripes, speckled, and spotted.
GEN.30.40	And Ya’akov 
GEN.30.41	And it came to pass, whenever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Ya’akov laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.
GEN.30.42	But when the cattle were feeble, he put 
GEN.30.43	And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and donkeys.
GEN.31.1	And he heard the words of Lavan’s sons, saying, Ya’akov has taken away all that 
GEN.31.2	And Ya’akov beheld the Countenance 
GEN.31.3	And the 
GEN.31.4	And Ya’akov sent and called Rachel and Le’ah 
GEN.31.5	And said unto them, I see your
GEN.31.6	And you
GEN.31.7	And your
GEN.31.8	If he said in this way, The speckled shall be your
GEN.31.9	In the following manner God-Elōhīm 
GEN.31.10	Once, when the animals were mating, I had a dream: I looked up and there in front of me the male goats which mated with the females were streaked, speckled and mottled.
GEN.31.11	And the angel of God-Elōhīm 
GEN.31.12	And he said, Lift up now your
GEN.31.13	I 
GEN.31.14	And Rachel 
GEN.31.15	Are we not counted of him strangers? for he has sold us, and has quite devoured also our money.
GEN.31.16	For all the riches which God-Elōhīm 
GEN.31.17	Then Ya’akov 
GEN.31.18	And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Paddan-aram 
GEN.31.19	And Lavan went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that 
GEN.31.20	And Ya’akov stole away unawares to Lavan the Arami 
GEN.31.21	So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river 
GEN.31.22	And it was told Lavan 
GEN.31.23	And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days’ journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gil’ad 
GEN.31.24	And God-Elōhīm 
GEN.31.25	Then Lavan overtook Ya’akov. Now Ya’akov had pitched his tent in the mount: and Lavan with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gil’ad 
GEN.31.26	And Lavan said to Ya’akov, What have you
GEN.31.27	For what reason did you
GEN.31.28	And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? you
GEN.31.29	It is in the power of my hand to do you
GEN.31.30	And now, 
GEN.31.31	And Ya’akov answered and said to Lavan, Because I was afraid: for I said, Perhaps you
GEN.31.32	With whomsoever you
GEN.31.33	And Lavan went into Ya’akov’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the two maidservants’ tents; but he found 
GEN.31.34	Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel’s furniture, and sat upon them. And Lavan 
GEN.31.35	And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before you
GEN.31.36	And Ya’akov 
GEN.31.37	Whereas you
GEN.31.38	This twenty years 
GEN.31.39	That which was torn 
GEN.31.41	In the following manner have I been twenty years in your
GEN.31.42	Except the God-Elōhīm 
GEN.31.43	And Lavan answered and said unto Ya’akov, 
GEN.31.44	Now therefore come you
GEN.31.45	And Ya’akov 
GEN.31.46	And Ya’akov said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.
GEN.31.47	And Lavan called it Y’gar-Sahaduta 
GEN.31.48	And Lavan said, This heap 
GEN.31.49	And HaMitzpah; for he said, The 
GEN.31.50	If you
GEN.31.51	And Lavan 
GEN.31.52	This heap 
GEN.31.53	The God-Elōhīm 
GEN.31.54	Then Ya’akov offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.
GEN.31.55	And early in the morning Lavan rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and Blessed 
GEN.32.1	And Ya’akov went on his way, and the angels of God-Elōhīm 
GEN.32.2	And when Ya’akov saw them, he said, This 
GEN.32.3	And Ya’akov 
GEN.32.4	And he commanded them, saying, In the following manner shall you
GEN.32.5	And I have oxen, and donkeys, flocks, and menservants, and women servants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in your
GEN.32.6	And the messengers returned to Ya’akov, saying, We came to your
GEN.32.7	Then Ya’akov was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that 
GEN.32.8	And said, If ‘Esav 
GEN.32.9	And Ya’akov 
GEN.32.10	I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which you
GEN.32.11	Deliver me, I pray you
GEN.32.12	And you
GEN.32.13	And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for ‘Esav 
GEN.32.14	Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,
GEN.32.15	Thirty milk production camels with their colts, forty cows, and ten bulls, twenty she donkeys, and ten foals.
GEN.32.16	And he delivered 
GEN.32.17	And he commanded the foremost, saying, When ‘Esav my brother meets you
GEN.32.18	Then you
GEN.32.19	And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall you
GEN.32.20	And say you
GEN.32.21	So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.
GEN.32.22	And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two women servants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Yabok 
GEN.32.23	And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.
GEN.32.24	And Ya’akov 
GEN.32.25	And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Ya’akov’s 
GEN.32.26	And he said, Let me go, for the day breaks. And he said, I will not let you
GEN.32.27	And he said unto him, What 
GEN.32.28	And he said, your
GEN.32.29	And Ya’akov asked 
GEN.32.30	And Ya’akov 
GEN.32.31	And Ya’akov 
GEN.32.32	Therefore the children of Isra’el eat not 
GEN.33.1	And Ya’akov lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, ‘Esav 
GEN.33.2	And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Le’ah and her children after, and Rachel 
GEN.33.3	And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
GEN.33.4	And ‘Esav 
GEN.33.5	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who 
GEN.33.6	Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
GEN.33.7	And Le’ah 
GEN.33.8	And he said, What 
GEN.33.9	And ‘Esav 
GEN.33.10	And Ya’akov 
GEN.33.11	Take, I pray you
GEN.33.12	And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you
GEN.33.13	And he said unto him, My lord knows that the children 
GEN.33.14	Let my lord, I pray you
GEN.33.15	And ‘Esav 
GEN.33.16	So ‘Esav 
GEN.33.17	And Ya’akov 
GEN.33.18	And Ya’akov 
GEN.33.19	And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor [male-donkey 
GEN.33.20	And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-Isra’el [God-EL, the Mighty God of Isra’el-Prince with God].
GEN.34.1	And Dinah 
GEN.34.2	And when Sh’khem 
GEN.34.3	And his soul clave unto Dinah 
GEN.34.4	And Sh’khem 
GEN.34.5	And Ya’akov 
GEN.34.6	And Hamor [male-donkey 
GEN.34.7	And the sons of Ya’akov came out of the field when they heard 
GEN.34.8	And Hamor 
GEN.34.9	And make you
GEN.34.10	And you
GEN.34.11	And Sh’khem 
GEN.34.12	Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as you
GEN.34.13	And the sons of Ya’akov 
GEN.34.14	And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that 
GEN.34.15	But in this will we consent unto you: If you
GEN.34.16	Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your
GEN.34.17	But if you
GEN.34.18	And their words pleased Hamor [male-donkey 
GEN.34.19	And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Ya’akov’s daughter: and he 
GEN.34.20	And Hamor [male-donkey 
GEN.34.21	These men 
GEN.34.22	Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they 
GEN.34.24	And unto Hamor [male-donkey 
GEN.34.25	And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Ya’akov, Shim’on 
GEN.34.26	And they killed Hamor 
GEN.34.27	The sons of Ya’akov came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.
GEN.34.28	They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their donkeys, and that which 
GEN.34.29	And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that 
GEN.34.30	And Ya’akov 
GEN.34.31	And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an prostitute?
GEN.35.1	And God-EL 
GEN.35.2	Then Ya’akov said unto his household, and to all that 
GEN.35.3	And let us arise, and go up to Beit-El 
GEN.35.4	And they gave unto Ya’akov all the strange gods which 
GEN.35.5	And they journeyed: and the terror of God-Elōhīm 
GEN.35.6	So Ya’akov came to Luz 
GEN.35.7	And he built there an altar, and called the place El-bet-el 
GEN.35.8	But D’vorah 
GEN.35.9	And God-Elōhīm 
GEN.35.10	And God-Elōhīm 
GEN.35.11	And God-Elōhīm 
GEN.35.12	And the land which I gave Avraham 
GEN.35.13	And God-Elōhīm 
GEN.35.14	And Ya’akov 
GEN.35.15	And Ya’akov called the name of the place where God-Elōhīm 
GEN.35.16	And they journeyed from Beit-El 
GEN.35.17	And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; you
GEN.35.18	And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, 
GEN.35.19	And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Efrat, which is Beit-Lechem 
GEN.35.20	And Ya’akov 
GEN.35.21	And Isra’el 
GEN.35.22	And it came to pass, when Isra’el 
GEN.35.23	The sons of Le’ah 
GEN.35.24	The sons of Rachel 
GEN.35.25	And the sons of Bilhah 
GEN.35.26	And the sons of Zilpah 
GEN.35.27	And Ya’akov 
GEN.35.28	And the days of Yitz’chak 
GEN.35.29	And Yitz’chak 
GEN.36.1	Now these 
GEN.36.2	‘Esav took his wives of the daughters of Kena’ani 
GEN.36.3	And Basmat 
GEN.36.4	And ‘Adah 
GEN.36.5	And Oholivamah 
GEN.36.6	And ‘Esav 
GEN.36.7	For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.
GEN.36.8	In the following manner dwelt ‘Esav in mount Se’ir: ‘Esav 
GEN.36.9	And these 
GEN.36.10	These 
GEN.36.11	And the sons of Elifaz [my god -or God- is 
GEN.36.12	And Timna 
GEN.36.13	And these 
GEN.36.14	And these were the sons of Oholivamah 
GEN.36.15	These 
GEN.36.16	Chieftain Korach, chieftain Ga’Tam, 
GEN.36.17	And these 
GEN.36.18	And these 
GEN.36.19	These 
GEN.36.20	These 
GEN.36.21	And Dishon 
GEN.36.22	And the children of Lotan 
GEN.36.23	And the children of Shoval 
GEN.36.24	And these 
GEN.36.25	And the children of ‘Anah 
GEN.36.26	And these 
GEN.36.27	The children of Etzer 
GEN.36.28	The children of Dishan 
GEN.36.29	These 
GEN.36.30	Chieftain Dishon 
GEN.36.31	And these 
GEN.36.32	And Bela 
GEN.36.33	And Bela 
GEN.36.34	And Yovav 
GEN.36.35	And Husham 
GEN.36.36	And Hadad 
GEN.36.37	And Samlah 
GEN.36.38	And Sha’ul 
GEN.36.39	And Ba’al-Chanan 
GEN.36.40	And these 
GEN.36.41	Chieftain Oholivamah

GEN.36.43	Chieftain Magdi’el 
GEN.37.1	And Ya’akov 
GEN.37.2	These 
GEN.37.3	Now Isra’el loved Yosef more than all his children, because he 
GEN.37.4	And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.
GEN.37.5	And Yosef 
GEN.37.6	And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:
GEN.37.7	For, behold, we 
GEN.37.8	And his brethren said to him, Shalt you
GEN.37.9	And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obesiance 
GEN.37.10	And he told 
GEN.37.11	And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.
GEN.37.12	And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Sh’khem 
GEN.37.13	And Isra’el 
GEN.37.14	And he said to him, Go, I pray you
GEN.37.15	And a certain man found him, and, behold, 
GEN.37.16	And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray you
GEN.37.17	And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dotan 
GEN.37.18	And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.
GEN.37.19	And they said one to another, ‘Behold, this dreamer comes!’
GEN.37.20	Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast has devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.
GEN.37.21	And Re’uven 
GEN.37.22	And Re’uven said unto them, Shed no blood, 
GEN.37.23	And it came to pass, when Yosef was come unto his brethren, that they stripped Yosef out of his coat, 
GEN.37.24	And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit 
GEN.37.25	And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Yishma’elim 
GEN.37.26	And Y’hudah 
GEN.37.27	Come, and let us sell him to the Yishma’elim 
GEN.37.28	Then there passed by Midyanim 
GEN.37.29	And Re’uven 
GEN.37.30	And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child 
GEN.37.31	And they took Yosef’s coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;
GEN.37.32	And they sent the coat of 
GEN.37.33	And he knew it, and said, 
GEN.37.34	And Ya’akov 
GEN.37.35	And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. In the following manner his father wept for him.
GEN.37.36	And the Midyanim 
GEN.38.1	And it came to pass at that time, that Y’hudah 
GEN.38.2	And Y’hudah 
GEN.38.3	And she conceived, and bore a son; and he called his name ‘Er 
GEN.38.4	And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she called his name Onan 
GEN.38.5	And she yet again conceived, and bore a son; and called his name Shelach 
GEN.38.6	And Y’hudah 
GEN.38.7	And ‘Er 
GEN.38.8	And Y’hudah 
GEN.38.9	And Onan 
GEN.38.10	And the thing which he did displeased the 
GEN.38.11	Then said Y’hudah to Tamar 
GEN.38.12	And in process of time the daughter of Shua Y’hudah’s 
GEN.38.13	And it was told Tamar 
GEN.38.14	And she put her widow’s garments off from her, and covered her with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which 
GEN.38.15	When Y’hudah 
GEN.38.16	And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray you
GEN.38.17	And he said, I will send 
GEN.38.18	And he said, What pledge shall I give you
GEN.38.19	And she arose, and went away, and laid by her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
GEN.38.20	And Y’hudah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the ‘Adulami, to receive 
GEN.38.21	Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where 
GEN.38.22	And he returned to Y’hudah 
GEN.38.23	And Y’hudah said, Let her take 
GEN.38.24	And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Y’hudah, saying, Tamar 
GEN.38.25	When she 
GEN.38.26	And Y’hudah 
GEN.38.27	And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins 
GEN.38.28	And it came to pass, when she travailed, that 
GEN.38.29	And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast you
GEN.38.30	And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zerach 
GEN.39.1	And Yosef 
GEN.39.2	And the 
GEN.39.3	And his master saw that the 
GEN.39.4	And Yosef found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all 
GEN.39.5	And it came to pass from the time 
GEN.39.6	And he left all that he had in Yosef’s 
GEN.39.7	And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Yosef; and she said, Lie with me.
GEN.39.8	But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my master knows not what 
GEN.39.10	And it came to pass, as she spoke to Yosef day by day, that he listened not unto her, to lie by her, 
GEN.39.11	And it came to pass about this time, that 
GEN.39.12	And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.
GEN.39.13	And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,
GEN.39.14	That she called unto the men of her house, and spoke unto them, saying, See, he has brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:
GEN.39.15	And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.
GEN.39.16	And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.
GEN.39.17	And she spoke unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which you

GEN.39.19	And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke unto him, saying, After this manner did your
GEN.39.20	And Yosef’s 
GEN.39.21	But the 
GEN.39.22	And the keeper of the prison committed to Yosef’s hand all the prisoners that 
GEN.39.23	The keeper of the prison looked not to anything 
GEN.40.1	And it came to pass after these things, 
GEN.40.2	And Pharaoh 
GEN.40.3	And he put them in ward 
GEN.40.4	And the captain of the guard charged Yosef with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward 
GEN.40.5	And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Mitzrayim 
GEN.40.6	And Yosef came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they 
GEN.40.7	And he asked Pharaoh’s officers that 
GEN.40.8	And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and 
GEN.40.9	And the chief butler told his dream to Yosef, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine 
GEN.40.10	And in the vine 
GEN.40.11	And Pharaoh’s cup 
GEN.40.12	And Yosef said unto him, This 
GEN.40.13	Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up your
GEN.40.14	But think on me when it shall be well with you
GEN.40.15	For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
GEN.40.16	When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Yosef, I also 
GEN.40.17	And in the uppermost basket 
GEN.40.18	And Yosef answered and said, This 
GEN.40.19	Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up your
GEN.40.20	And it came to pass the third day, 
GEN.40.21	And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand:
GEN.40.22	But he hanged the chief baker: as Yosef had interpreted to them.
GEN.40.23	Yet did not the chief butler remember Yosef, but forgot him.
GEN.41.1	And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh 
GEN.41.2	And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured cows and fatfleshed 
GEN.41.3	And, behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed 
GEN.41.4	And the ill favoured and leanfleshed cows did eat up the seven well favoured and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.
GEN.41.5	And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
GEN.41.6	And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.
GEN.41.7	And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, 
GEN.41.8	And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Mitzrayim 
GEN.41.9	Then spoke the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:
GEN.41.10	Pharaoh was exceedingly angry with his servants, and put me in ward 
GEN.41.11	And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
GEN.41.12	And 
GEN.41.13	And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto my office, and him he hanged.
GEN.41.14	Then Pharaoh 
GEN.41.15	And Pharaoh said unto Yosef, I have dreamed a dream, and 
GEN.41.16	And Yosef answered Pharaoh, saying, 
GEN.41.17	And Pharaoh said unto Yosef, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:
GEN.41.18	And, behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:
GEN.41.19	And, behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Mitzrayim 
GEN.41.20	And the lean and the ill favoured cows did eat up the first seven fat cows:
GEN.41.21	And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they 
GEN.41.22	And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:
GEN.41.23	And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, 
GEN.41.24	And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told 
GEN.41.25	And Yosef 
GEN.41.26	The seven good cows 
GEN.41.27	And the seven thin and ill favoured cows that came up after them 
GEN.41.28	This 
GEN.41.29	Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Mitzrayim 
GEN.41.30	And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Mitzrayim 
GEN.41.31	And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it 
GEN.41.32	And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; 
GEN.41.33	Now therefore let Pharaoh (Great House) look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Mitzrayim 
GEN.41.34	Let Pharaoh do 
GEN.41.35	And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.
GEN.41.36	And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Mitzrayim 
GEN.41.37	And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh 
GEN.41.38	And Pharaoh 
GEN.41.39	And Pharaoh 
GEN.41.40	You
GEN.41.41	And Pharaoh 
GEN.41.42	And Pharaoh 
GEN.41.43	And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him 
GEN.41.44	And Pharaoh 
GEN.41.45	And Pharaoh called Yosef’s 
GEN.41.46	And Yosef 
GEN.41.47	And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
GEN.41.48	And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Mitzrayim 
GEN.41.49	And Yosef gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for 
GEN.41.50	And unto Yosef 
GEN.41.51	And Yosef 
GEN.41.52	And the name of the second he called Efrayim 
GEN.41.53	And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Mitzrayim 
GEN.41.54	And the seven years of famine began to ome, according as Yosef had said: and the famine was in all lands; but in all the land of Mitzrayim 
GEN.41.55	And when all the land of Mitzrayim 
GEN.41.56	And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Yosef opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Mitzrayimot 
GEN.41.57	And all countries came into Mitzrayim 
GEN.42.1	Now when Ya’akov 
GEN.42.2	And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Mitzrayim 
GEN.42.3	Yosef’s 
GEN.42.4	But Binyamin 
GEN.42.5	And the sons of Isra’el 
GEN.42.6	And Yosef 
GEN.42.7	And Yosef saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spoke roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come you
GEN.42.8	And Yosef knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
GEN.42.9	And Yosef remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, You
GEN.42.10	And they said unto him, No, my lord, but to buy food are your
GEN.42.11	We 
GEN.42.12	And he said unto them, No, but to see the nakedness of the land you
GEN.42.13	And they said, your
GEN.42.14	And Yosef 
GEN.42.15	Hereby you
GEN.42.16	Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and you
GEN.42.17	And he put them all to (to do entirely, do wholly) gether into ward 
GEN.42.18	And Yosef said unto them the third day, This do, and live; 
GEN.42.19	If you
GEN.42.20	But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and you
GEN.42.21	And they said one to another, We 
GEN.42.22	And Re’uven 
GEN.42.23	And they knew not that Yosef 
GEN.42.24	And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Shim’on 
GEN.42.25	Then Yosef 
GEN.42.26	And they laded their donkeys with the corn, and departed there.
GEN.42.27	And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey provender 
GEN.42.28	And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, 
GEN.42.29	And they came unto Ya’akov 
GEN.42.30	The man, 
GEN.42.31	And we said unto him, We 
GEN.42.32	We 
GEN.42.33	And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that you
GEN.42.34	And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that you
GEN.42.35	And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man’s bundle of money 
GEN.42.36	And Ya’akov 
GEN.42.37	And Re’uven 
GEN.42.38	And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which you
GEN.43.1	And the famine 
GEN.43.2	And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Mitzrayim 
GEN.43.3	And Y’hudah 
GEN.43.4	If you
GEN.43.5	But if you
GEN.43.6	And Isra’el 
GEN.43.7	And they said, The man asked us rigorously of our state, and of our family, saying, 
GEN.43.8	And Y’hudah 
GEN.43.9	I will be surety for him; of my hand shall you
GEN.43.10	For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.
GEN.43.11	And their father Isra’el 
GEN.43.12	And take double money in yourf hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of yourf sacks, carry 
GEN.43.13	Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:
GEN.43.14	And EL Shaddai 
GEN.43.15	And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Binyamin; and rose up, and went down to Mitzrayim 
GEN.43.16	And when Yosef 
GEN.43.17	And the man did as Yosef bade; and the man brought the men into Yosef’s house.
GEN.43.18	And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Yosef’s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our donkeys.
GEN.43.19	And they came near to the steward of Yosef’s house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,
GEN.43.20	And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:
GEN.43.21	And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, 
GEN.43.22	And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.
GEN.43.23	And he said, Peace 
GEN.43.24	And the man brought the men into Yosef’s house, and gave 
GEN.43.25	And they made ready the present against Yosef came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
GEN.43.26	And when Yosef 
GEN.43.27	And he asked them of 
GEN.43.28	And they answered, your
GEN.43.29	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Binyamin 
GEN.43.30	And Yosef made haste; for his bowels 
GEN.43.31	And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.
GEN.43.32	And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Mitzrayimot 
GEN.43.33	And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marveled one at another.
GEN.43.34	And he took 
GEN.44.1	And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks 
GEN.44.2	And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Yosef had spoken.
GEN.44.3	As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.
GEN.44.6	And he overtook them, and he spoke unto them these same words.
GEN.44.7	And they said unto him, For what reason says my lord these words? God-Elōhīm 
GEN.44.8	Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again unto you
GEN.44.9	With whomsoever of your
GEN.44.10	And he said, Now also 
GEN.44.11	Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.
GEN.44.12	And he searched, 
GEN.44.13	Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his donkey, and returned to the city.
GEN.44.14	And Y’hudah 
GEN.44.15	And Yosef said unto them, What deed 
GEN.44.16	And Y’hudah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God-Elōhīm 
GEN.44.17	And he said, God-Elōhīm 
GEN.44.18	Then Y’hudah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let you
GEN.44.19	My lord asked his servants, saying, Have you
GEN.44.20	And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.
GEN.44.21	And you
GEN.44.22	And we said unto my lord, The boy cannot leave his father: for 
GEN.44.23	And you
GEN.44.24	And it came to pass when we came up unto your
GEN.44.25	And our father said, Go again, 
GEN.44.26	And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother 
GEN.44.27	And your
GEN.44.28	And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:
GEN.44.29	If you
GEN.44.30	Now therefore when I come to your
GEN.44.31	It shall come to pass, when he sees that the boy 
GEN.44.32	For your
GEN.44.33	Now therefore, I pray you
GEN.44.34	For how shall I go up to my father, and the boy 
GEN.45.1	Then Yosef 
GEN.45.2	And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
GEN.45.3	And Yosef said unto his brethren, I 
GEN.45.4	And Yosef 
GEN.45.5	Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you
GEN.45.6	For these two years 
GEN.45.7	And God-Elōhīm 
GEN.45.8	So now 
GEN.45.9	Haste you
GEN.45.10	And you
GEN.45.11	And there will I nourish you
GEN.45.12	And, behold, your
GEN.45.13	And you
GEN.45.14	And he fell upon his brother Binyamin’s neck, and wept; and Binyamin wept upon his neck.
GEN.45.15	Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.
GEN.45.16	And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s 
GEN.45.17	And Pharaoh said unto Yosef, Say unto your
GEN.45.18	And take your
GEN.45.19	Now you
GEN.45.20	Also regard not your
GEN.45.21	And the children of Isra’el 
GEN.45.22	To all of them he gave each man changes of clothing; but to Binyamin 
GEN.45.23	And to his father he sent after this 
GEN.45.24	So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that you
GEN.45.25	And they went up out of Mitzrayim 
GEN.45.26	And told him, saying, Yosef 
GEN.45.27	And they told him all the words of Yosef, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Yosef had sent to carry him, the spirit of Ya’akov 
GEN.45.28	And Isra’el 
GEN.46.1	And Isra’el took his journey with all that he had, and came to Be’er-Sheva, and offered sacrifices unto the God-Elōhīm 
GEN.46.2	And God-Elōhīm 
GEN.46.3	And he said, I 
GEN.46.4	I will go down with you
GEN.46.5	And Ya’akov 
GEN.46.6	And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Kena’an 
GEN.46.7	His sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Mitzrayim 
GEN.46.8	And these 
GEN.46.9	And the sons of Re’uven 
GEN.46.10	And the sons of Shim’on 
GEN.46.11	And the sons of Levi 
GEN.46.12	And the sons of Y’hudah 
GEN.46.13	And the sons of Yissakhar 
GEN.46.14	And the sons of Z’vulun 
GEN.46.15	These 
GEN.46.16	And the sons of Gad 
GEN.46.17	And the sons of Asher 
GEN.46.18	These 
GEN.46.19	The sons of Rachel 
GEN.46.20	And unto Yosef 
GEN.46.21	And the sons of Binyamin 
GEN.46.22	These 
GEN.46.23	And the sons of Dan 
GEN.46.24	And the sons of Naftali 
GEN.46.25	These 
GEN.46.26	All the souls that came with Ya’akov 
GEN.46.27	And the sons of Yosef 
GEN.46.28	And he sent Y’hudah 
GEN.46.29	And Yosef made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Isra’el his father, to Goshen 
GEN.46.30	And Isra’el 
GEN.46.31	And Yosef said unto his brethren, and unto his father’s house, I will go up, and show Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father’s house, which 
GEN.46.32	And the men 
GEN.46.33	And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh 
GEN.46.34	That you
GEN.47.1	Then Yosef came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Kena’an; and, behold, they 
GEN.47.2	And he took some of his brethren, 
GEN.47.3	And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What 
GEN.47.4	They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for your
GEN.47.5	And Pharaoh spoke unto Yosef, saying, your
GEN.47.6	The land of Mitzrayim 
GEN.47.7	And Yosef 
GEN.47.8	And Pharaoh said unto Ya’akov, How old 
GEN.47.9	And Ya’akov said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage 
GEN.47.10	And Ya’akov Blessed 
GEN.47.11	And Yosef placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Mitzrayim 
GEN.47.12	And Yosef 
GEN.47.13	And 
GEN.47.14	And Yosef gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Mitzrayim 
GEN.47.15	And when money failed in the land of Mitzrayim 
GEN.47.16	And Yosef said, Give your
GEN.47.17	And they brought their cattle unto Yosef: and Yosef gave them bread 
GEN.47.18	When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide 
GEN.47.19	For what reason shall we die before your
GEN.47.20	And Yosef bought all the land of Mitzrayim 
GEN.47.21	And as for the people, he removed them to cities from 
GEN.47.22	Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion 
GEN.47.23	Then Yosef said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you
GEN.47.24	And it shall come to pass in the increase, that you
GEN.47.25	And they said, You
GEN.47.26	And Yosef made it a law over the land of Mitzrayim 
GEN.47.27	And Isra’el 
GEN.47.28	And Ya’akov 
GEN.47.29	And the time drew near that Isra’el 
GEN.47.30	But I will lie with my fathers, and you
GEN.47.31	And he said, Swear unto me. And he swore unto him. And Isra’el bowed himself upon the bed’s head.
GEN.48.1	And it came to pass after these things, that 
GEN.48.2	And 
GEN.48.3	And Ya’akov said unto Yosef, El-Shaddai 
GEN.48.4	And said unto me, Behold, I will make you
GEN.48.5	And now your
GEN.48.6	And your
GEN.48.7	And as for me, when I came from Paddan 
GEN.48.8	And Isra’el 
GEN.48.9	And Yosef 
GEN.48.10	Now the eyes of Isra’el 
GEN.48.11	And Isra’el said unto Yosef, I had not thought to see your
GEN.48.12	And Yosef brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
GEN.48.13	And Yosef 
GEN.48.14	And Isra’el 
GEN.48.15	And he Blessed 
GEN.48.16	The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Avraham 
GEN.48.17	And when Yosef saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Efrayim, it displeased him: and he held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Efrayim’s head unto M’nasheh’s head.
GEN.48.18	And Yosef said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this 
GEN.48.19	And his father refused, and said, I know 
GEN.48.20	And he Blessed 
GEN.48.21	And Isra’el said unto Yosef, Behold, I die: but God-Elōhīm 
GEN.48.22	Moreover I have given to you
GEN.49.1	And Ya’akov 
GEN.49.2	Gather yourselves together, and hear, you
GEN.49.3	Re’uven 
GEN.49.4	Unstable as water, you
GEN.49.5	Shim’on 
GEN.49.6	O my soul, come not you
GEN.49.7	Cursed 
GEN.49.8	Y’hudah (Let the Powerful One be Praised 
GEN.49.9	Y’hudah 
GEN.49.10	The sceptre shall not depart from Y’hudah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh 
GEN.49.11	Binding his foal unto the vine, and his donkey’s colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:
GEN.49.12	His eyes 
GEN.49.13	Z’vulun 
GEN.49.14	Yissakhar

GEN.49.17	Dan 
GEN.49.18	I have waited for your

GEN.49.20	Out of Asher 
GEN.49.21	Naftali 
GEN.49.22	Yosef 
GEN.49.23	The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot 
GEN.49.24	But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God-Elōhīm 
GEN.49.25	by the God-Elōhīm 
GEN.49.26	The blessings of your
GEN.49.27	Binyamin 
GEN.49.28	All these 
GEN.49.29	And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that 
GEN.49.30	In the cave that 
GEN.49.31	There they buried Avraham 
GEN.49.32	The purchase of the field and of the cave that 
GEN.49.33	And when Ya’akov 
GEN.50.1	And Yosef 
GEN.50.2	And Yosef commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Isra’el 
GEN.50.3	And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Mitzrayimot 
GEN.50.4	And when the days of his mourning were past, Yosef spoke unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your
GEN.50.5	My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have dug for me in the land of Kena’an 
GEN.50.6	And Pharaoh 
GEN.50.7	And Yosef 
GEN.50.8	And all the house of Yosef, and his brethren, and his father’s house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen 
GEN.50.9	And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.
GEN.50.10	And they came to the threshing floor of Atad 
GEN.50.11	And when the inhabitants of the land, the Kena’ani (low/humbled ones; merchants), saw the mourning in the floor of Atad 
GEN.50.12	And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:
GEN.50.13	For his sons carried him into the land of Kena’an 
GEN.50.14	And Yosef 
GEN.50.15	And when Yosef’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Yosef will perhaps hate us, and will certainly requite 
GEN.50.16	And they sent a messenger unto Yosef, saying, your
GEN.50.17	So shall you
GEN.50.18	And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we 
GEN.50.19	And Yosef said unto them, Fear not: for 
GEN.50.20	But as for you, you
GEN.50.21	Now therefore fear you
GEN.50.22	And Yosef dwelt in Mitzrayim 
GEN.50.23	And Yosef saw Efrayim’s children of the third 
GEN.50.24	And Yosef 
GEN.50.25	And Yosef took an oath of the children of Isra’el 
GEN.50.26	So Yosef 
EXO.1.1	Now these 
EXO.1.2	Re’uven 
EXO.1.3	Yissakhar 
EXO.1.4	Dan 
EXO.1.5	And all the souls that came out of the waist of Ya’akov 
EXO.1.6	And Yosef 
EXO.1.7	And the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.1.8	Now there arose up a new king over Mitzrayim 
EXO.1.9	And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.1.10	Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falls out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and 
EXO.1.11	Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Par’oh 
EXO.1.12	But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.1.13	And the Mitzri made the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.1.14	And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, 
EXO.1.15	And the king of Mitzrayim 
EXO.1.16	And he said, When you
EXO.1.17	But the midwives feared God-Elōhīm 
EXO.1.18	And the king of Mitzrayim 
EXO.1.19	And the midwives said unto Par’oh 
EXO.1.20	Therefore God-Elōhīm 
EXO.1.21	And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God-Elōhīm 
EXO.1.22	And Par’oh 
EXO.2.1	And there went a man of the house of Levi 
EXO.2.2	And the woman conceived, and bore a son: and when she saw him that he 
EXO.2.3	And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child in it; and she laid 
EXO.2.4	And his sister stood afar off, that is to say what would be done to him.
EXO.2.5	And the daughter of Par’oh 
EXO.2.6	And when she had opened 
EXO.2.7	Then said his sister to Par’oh’s 
EXO.2.8	And Par’oh’s 
EXO.2.9	And Par’oh’s 
EXO.2.10	And the child grew, and she brought him unto Par’oh’s 
EXO.2.11	And it came to pass in those days, when Moshe 
EXO.2.12	And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that 
EXO.2.13	And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the ‘Evri’ot 
EXO.2.14	And he said, Who made you
EXO.2.15	Now when Par’oh 
EXO.2.16	Now the priest of Midyan 
EXO.2.17	And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moshe 
EXO.2.18	And when they came to Reu’el 
EXO.2.19	And they said, An Mitzri 
EXO.2.20	And he said unto his daughters, And where 
EXO.2.21	And Moshe 
EXO.2.22	And she bore 
EXO.2.23	And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Mitzrayim 
EXO.2.24	And God-Elōhīm 
EXO.2.25	And God-Elōhīm 
EXO.3.1	Now Moshe 
EXO.3.2	And the angel of the 
EXO.3.3	And Moshe 
EXO.3.4	And when the 
EXO.3.5	And he said, Draw not near here: put off you
EXO.3.6	Moreover he said, I 
EXO.3.7	And the 
EXO.3.8	And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Mitzri, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Kena’ani 
EXO.3.9	Now therefore, behold, the cry of the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.3.10	Come now therefore, and I will send you
EXO.3.11	And Moshe 
EXO.3.12	And he said, Certainly, I will be with you
EXO.3.13	And Moshe 
EXO.3.14	And God-Elōhīm 
EXO.3.15	And God-Elōhīm 
EXO.3.16	Go, and gather the elders of Yisra’el 
EXO.3.17	And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Mitzrayim 
EXO.3.18	And they shall hearken to you
EXO.3.19	And I am sure that the king of Mitzrayim 
EXO.3.20	And I will stretch out my hand, and strike Mitzrayim 
EXO.3.21	And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Mitzri: and it shall come to pass, that, when you
EXO.3.22	But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourns in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing: and you
EXO.4.1	And Moshe 
EXO.4.2	And the 
EXO.4.3	And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moshe 
EXO.4.4	And the 
EXO.4.5	That they may believe that the 
EXO.4.6	And the 
EXO.4.7	And he said, Put you
EXO.4.8	And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe you
EXO.4.9	And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto you
EXO.4.10	And Moshe 
EXO.4.11	And the 
EXO.4.12	Now therefore go, and I will be with you
EXO.4.13	And he said, O my Lord-Adonai 
EXO.4.14	And the anger of the 
EXO.4.15	And you
EXO.4.16	And he shall be you
EXO.4.17	And you
EXO.4.18	And Moshe 
EXO.4.19	And the 
EXO.4.20	And Moshe 
EXO.4.21	And the 
EXO.4.22	And you
EXO.4.23	And I say unto you
EXO.4.24	And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the 
EXO.4.25	Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast 
EXO.4.26	So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband 
EXO.4.27	And the 
EXO.4.28	And Moshe 
EXO.4.29	And Moshe 
EXO.4.30	And Aharon 
EXO.4.31	And the people believed: and when they heard that the 
EXO.5.1	And afterward Moshe 
EXO.5.2	And Par’oh 
EXO.5.3	And they said, The God-Elōhīm 
EXO.5.4	And the king of Mitzrayim 
EXO.5.5	And Par’oh 
EXO.5.6	And Par’oh 
EXO.5.7	You
EXO.5.8	And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, you
EXO.5.9	Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour in it; and let them not regard vain words.
EXO.5.10	And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus says Par’oh 
EXO.5.11	Go you
EXO.5.12	So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Mitzrayim 
EXO.5.13	And the taskmasters hasted 
EXO.5.14	And the officers of the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.5.15	Then the officers of the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.5.16	There is no straw given unto you
EXO.5.17	But he said, You
EXO.5.18	Go therefore now, 
EXO.5.19	And the officers of the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.5.20	And they met Moshe 
EXO.5.21	And they said unto them, The 
EXO.5.22	And Moshe 
EXO.5.23	For since I came to Par’oh 
EXO.6.1	Then the 
EXO.6.2	And God-Elōhīm 
EXO.6.3	And I appeared unto Avraham 
EXO.6.4	And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Kena’an 
EXO.6.5	And I have also heard the groaning of the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.6.6	For what reason say unto the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.6.7	And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God-Elōhīm 
EXO.6.8	And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Avraham 
EXO.6.9	And Moshe 
EXO.6.10	And the 
EXO.6.11	Go in, speak unto Par’oh 
EXO.6.12	And Moshe 
EXO.6.13	And the 
EXO.6.14	These 
EXO.6.15	And the sons of Shim’on 
EXO.6.16	And these 
EXO.6.17	The sons of Gershon 
EXO.6.18	And the sons of K’hat 
EXO.6.19	And the sons of M’rari 
EXO.6.20	And ‘Amram 
EXO.6.21	And the sons of Yitz’har 
EXO.6.22	And the sons of Uzziel 
EXO.6.23	And Aharon 
EXO.6.24	And the sons of Korakh 
EXO.6.25	And El’azar 
EXO.6.26	These 
EXO.6.27	These 
EXO.6.28	And it came to pass on the day 
EXO.6.29	That the 
EXO.6.30	And Moshe 
EXO.7.1	And the 
EXO.7.2	you
EXO.7.3	And I will harden Par’oh’s 
EXO.7.4	But Par’oh 
EXO.7.5	And the Mitzri shall know that I 
EXO.7.6	And Moshe 
EXO.7.7	And Moshe 
EXO.7.8	And the 
EXO.7.9	When Par’oh 
EXO.7.10	And Moshe 
EXO.7.11	Then Par’oh 
EXO.7.12	For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aharon 
EXO.7.13	And he hardened Par’oh’s 
EXO.7.14	And the 
EXO.7.15	Get you
EXO.7.16	And you
EXO.7.17	Thus says the 
EXO.7.18	And the fish that 
EXO.7.19	And the 
EXO.7.20	And Moshe 
EXO.7.21	And the fish that 
EXO.7.22	And the magicians of Mitzrayim 
EXO.7.23	And Par’oh 
EXO.7.24	And all the Mitzri excavated round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.
EXO.7.25	And seven days were fulfilled, after that the 
EXO.8.1	And the 
EXO.8.2	And if you
EXO.8.3	And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into you
EXO.8.4	And the frogs shall come up both on you
EXO.8.5	And the 
EXO.8.6	And Aharon 
EXO.8.7	And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Mitzrayim 
EXO.8.8	Then Par’oh 
EXO.8.9	And Moshe 
EXO.8.10	And he said, Tomorrow. And he said, 
EXO.8.11	And the frogs shall depart from you
EXO.8.12	And Moshe 
EXO.8.13	And the 
EXO.8.14	And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.
EXO.8.15	But when Par’oh 
EXO.8.16	And the 
EXO.8.17	And they did so; for Aharon 
EXO.8.18	And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.
EXO.8.19	Then the magicians said unto Par’oh 
EXO.8.20	And the 
EXO.8.21	Else, if you
EXO.8.22	And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen 
EXO.8.23	And I will put a division between my people and you
EXO.8.24	And the 
EXO.8.25	And Par’oh 
EXO.8.26	And Moshe 
EXO.8.27	We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the 
EXO.8.28	And Par’oh 
EXO.8.29	And Moshe 
EXO.8.30	And Moshe 
EXO.8.31	And the 
EXO.8.32	And Par’oh 
EXO.9.1	Then the 
EXO.9.2	For if you
EXO.9.3	Behold, the hand of the 
EXO.9.4	And the 
EXO.9.5	And the 
EXO.9.6	And the 
EXO.9.7	And Par’oh 
EXO.9.8	And the 
EXO.9.9	And it shall become small dust in all the land of Mitzrayim 
EXO.9.10	And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Par’oh 
EXO.9.11	And the magicians could not stand before Moshe 
EXO.9.12	And the 
EXO.9.13	And the 
EXO.9.14	For I will at this time send all my plagues upon you
EXO.9.15	For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may strike you
EXO.9.16	And in very deed for this 
EXO.9.17	As yet exalt you
EXO.9.18	Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Mitzrayim 
EXO.9.19	Send therefore now, 
EXO.9.20	He that feared the word of the 
EXO.9.21	And he that regarded not the word of the 
EXO.9.22	And the 
EXO.9.23	And Moshe 
EXO.9.24	So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Mitzrayim 
EXO.9.25	And the hail struck throughout all the land of Mitzrayim 
EXO.9.26	Only in the land of Goshen 
EXO.9.27	And Par’oh 
EXO.9.28	Intreat the 
EXO.9.29	And Moshe 
EXO.9.30	But as for you
EXO.9.31	And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley 
EXO.9.32	But the wheat and the rye were not smitten: for they 
EXO.9.33	And Moshe 
EXO.9.34	And when Par’oh 
EXO.9.35	And the heart of Par’oh 
EXO.10.1	And the 
EXO.10.2	And that you
EXO.10.3	And Moshe 
EXO.10.4	Else, if you
EXO.10.5	And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue 
EXO.10.6	And they shall fill you
EXO.10.7	And Par’oh’s 
EXO.10.8	And Moshe 
EXO.10.9	And Moshe 
EXO.10.10	And he said unto them, Let the 
EXO.10.11	Not so: go now you
EXO.10.12	And the 
EXO.10.13	And Moshe 
EXO.10.14	And the locusts went up over all the land of Mitzrayim 
EXO.10.15	For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Mitzrayim 
EXO.10.16	Then Par’oh 
EXO.10.17	Now therefore forgive, I pray you
EXO.10.18	And he went out from Par’oh 
EXO.10.19	And the 
EXO.10.20	But the 
EXO.10.21	And the 
EXO.10.22	And Moshe 
EXO.10.23	They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.10.24	And Par’oh 
EXO.10.25	And Moshe 
EXO.10.26	Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the 
EXO.10.27	But the 
EXO.10.28	And Par’oh 
EXO.10.29	And Moshe 
EXO.11.1	And the 
EXO.11.2	Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.
EXO.11.3	And the 
EXO.11.4	And Moshe 
EXO.11.5	And all the firstborn in the land of Mitzrayim 
EXO.11.6	And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Mitzrayim 
EXO.11.7	But against any of the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.11.8	And all these you
EXO.11.9	And the 
EXO.11.10	And Moshe 
EXO.12.1	And the 
EXO.12.2	This month 
EXO.12.3	Speak you
EXO.12.4	And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take 
EXO.12.5	Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: you
EXO.12.6	And you
EXO.12.7	And they shall take of the blood, and strike 
EXO.12.8	And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; 
EXO.12.9	Eat not of it raw, nor coocked 
EXO.12.10	And you
EXO.12.11	And thus shall you
EXO.12.12	For I will pass through the land of Mitzrayim 
EXO.12.13	And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you
EXO.12.14	And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and you
EXO.12.15	Seven days shall you
EXO.12.16	And in the first day 
EXO.12.17	And you
EXO.12.18	In the first 
EXO.12.19	Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eats that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Yisra’el 
EXO.12.20	You
EXO.12.21	Then Moshe 
EXO.12.22	And you
EXO.12.23	For the 
EXO.12.24	And you
EXO.12.25	And it shall come to pass, when you
EXO.12.26	And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean you
EXO.12.27	That you
EXO.12.28	And the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.12.29	And it came to pass, that at midnight the 
EXO.12.30	And Par’oh 
EXO.12.31	And he called for Moshe 
EXO.12.32	Also take your flocks and your herds, as you
EXO.12.33	And the Mitzri were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We 
EXO.12.34	And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.
EXO.12.35	And the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.12.36	And the 
EXO.12.37	And the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.12.38	And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, 
EXO.12.39	And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Mitzrayim 
EXO.12.40	Now the sojourning of the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.12.41	And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the 
EXO.12.42	It 
EXO.12.43	And the 
EXO.12.44	But every man’s servant that is bought for money, when you
EXO.12.45	A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.
EXO.12.46	In one house shall it be eaten; you
EXO.12.47	All the congregation of Yisra’el 
EXO.12.48	And when a stranger shall sojourn with you
EXO.12.49	One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourners among you.
EXO.12.50	Thus did all the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.12.51	And it came to pass the selfsame day, 
EXO.13.1	And the 
EXO.13.2	Sanctify 
EXO.13.3	And Moshe 
EXO.13.4	This day came you
EXO.13.5	And it shall be when the 
EXO.13.6	Seven days you
EXO.13.7	Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with you
EXO.13.8	And you
EXO.13.9	And it shall be for a sign unto you
EXO.13.10	you
EXO.13.11	And it shall be when the 
EXO.13.12	That you
EXO.13.13	And every firstling of an ass you
EXO.13.14	And it shall be when your
EXO.13.15	And it came to pass, when Par’oh 
EXO.13.16	And it shall be for a token upon you
EXO.13.17	And it came to pass, when Par’oh 
EXO.13.18	But God-Elōhīm 
EXO.13.19	And Moshe 
EXO.13.20	And they took their journey from Sukkot 
EXO.13.21	And the 
EXO.13.22	He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, 
EXO.14.1	And the 
EXO.14.2	Speak unto the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.14.3	For Par’oh 
EXO.14.4	And I will harden Par’oh’s 
EXO.14.5	And it was told the king of Mitzrayim 
EXO.14.6	And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:
EXO.14.7	And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Mitzrayim 
EXO.14.8	And the 
EXO.14.9	But the Mitzri pursued after them, all the horses 
EXO.14.10	And when Par’oh 
EXO.14.11	And they said unto Moshe 
EXO.14.13	And Moshe 
EXO.14.14	The 
EXO.14.15	And the 
EXO.14.16	But lift you
EXO.14.17	And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Mitzri, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Par’oh 
EXO.14.18	And the Mitzri shall know that I 
EXO.14.19	And the angel of God-Elōhīm 
EXO.14.20	And it came between the camp of the Mitzri and the camp of Yisra’el 
EXO.14.21	And Moshe 
EXO.14.22	And the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.14.23	And the Mitzri pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, 
EXO.14.24	And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the 
EXO.14.25	And took off their chariot wheels, that they drove them heavily: so that the Mitzri said, Let us flee from the face of Yisra’el 
EXO.14.26	And the 
EXO.14.27	And Moshe 
EXO.14.28	And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, 
EXO.14.29	But the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.14.30	Thus the 
EXO.14.31	And Yisra’el 
EXO.15.1	Then sang Moshe 
EXO.15.2	The 
EXO.15.3	The 
EXO.15.4	Par’oh’s 
EXO.15.5	The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.
EXO.15.6	You
EXO.15.7	And in the greatness of your
EXO.15.8	And with the blast of you
EXO.15.9	The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil 
EXO.15.10	you
EXO.15.11	Who 
EXO.15.12	you
EXO.15.13	you
EXO.15.14	The people shall hear, 
EXO.15.15	Then the dukes of Edom 
EXO.15.16	Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of you
EXO.15.17	you
EXO.15.18	The 
EXO.15.19	For the horse of Par’oh 
EXO.15.20	And Miryam 
EXO.15.21	And Miryam 
EXO.15.22	So Moshe 
EXO.15.23	And when they came to Marah 
EXO.15.24	And the people murmured against Moshe 
EXO.15.25	And he cried unto the 
EXO.15.26	And said, If you
EXO.15.27	And they came to Eilim 
EXO.16.1	And they took their journey from Eilim 
EXO.16.2	And the whole congregation of the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.16.3	And the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.16.4	Then said the 
EXO.16.5	And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare 
EXO.16.6	And Moshe 
EXO.16.7	And in the morning, then you
EXO.16.8	And Moshe 
EXO.16.9	And Moshe 
EXO.16.10	And it came to pass, as Aharon 
EXO.16.11	And the 
EXO.16.12	I have heard the murmurings of the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.16.13	And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.
EXO.16.14	And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness 
EXO.16.15	And when the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.16.16	This 
EXO.16.17	And the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.16.18	And when they did measure 
EXO.16.19	And Moshe 
EXO.16.20	Yet they listened not unto Moshe 
EXO.16.21	And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.
EXO.16.22	And it came to pass, 
EXO.16.23	And he said unto them, This 
EXO.16.24	And they laid it up till the morning, as Moshe 
EXO.16.25	And Moshe 
EXO.16.26	Six days you
EXO.16.27	And it came to pass, 
EXO.16.28	And the

EXO.31.13	Speak you
EXO.31.14	You
EXO.31.15	Six days may work be done; but in the seventh 
EXO.31.16	For what reason the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.31.17	It 
EXO.31.18	And he gave unto Moshe 
EXO.32.1	And when the people saw that Moshe 
EXO.32.2	And Aharon 
EXO.32.3	And all the people broke off the golden earrings which 
EXO.32.4	And he received 
EXO.32.5	And when Aharon 
EXO.32.6	And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
EXO.32.7	And the 
EXO.32.8	They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These 
EXO.32.9	And the 
EXO.32.10	Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may grow 
EXO.32.11	And Moshe 
EXO.32.12	For what reason should the Mitzri speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from you
EXO.32.13	Remember Avraham 
EXO.32.14	And the 
EXO.32.15	And Moshe 
EXO.32.16	And the tables 
EXO.32.17	And when Y’hoshua 
EXO.32.18	And he said,

EXO.32.20	And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt 
EXO.32.21	And Moshe 
EXO.32.22	And Aharon 
EXO.32.23	For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for 
EXO.32.24	And I said unto them, Whosoever has any gold, let them break 
EXO.32.25	And when Moshe 
EXO.32.26	Then Moshe 
EXO.32.27	And he said unto them, Thus says the 
EXO.32.28	And the children of Levi 
EXO.32.29	For Moshe 
EXO.32.30	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moshe

EXO.33.5	For the 
EXO.33.6	And the people of Yisra’el 
EXO.33.7	And Moshe 
EXO.33.8	And it came to pass, when Moshe 
EXO.33.9	And it came to pass, as Moshe 
EXO.33.10	And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand 
EXO.33.11	And the 
EXO.33.12	And Moshe 
EXO.33.13	Now therefore, I pray you
EXO.33.14	And he said, My presence shall go [with you
EXO.33.15	And he said unto him, If you
EXO.33.16	For wherein shall it be known here that I and you

EXO.33.20	And he said, you
EXO.33.21	And the 
EXO.33.22	And it shall come to pass, while my glory passes by, that I will put you
EXO.33.23	And I will take away my hand, and you
EXO.34.1	And the 
EXO.34.2	And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me in the top of the mount.

LEV.14.49	And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:
LEV.14.50	And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:
LEV.14.51	And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:

LEV.20.8	And you
LEV.20.9	For every one that curses his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he has cursed his father or his mother; his blood 
LEV.20.10	And the man that commits adultery with 
LEV.20.11	And the man that lies with his father’s wife has uncovered his father’s nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood 
LEV.20.12	And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood 
LEV.20.13	If a man also lie with mankind, as he lies with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood 
LEV.20.14	And if a man take a wife and her mother, it 
LEV.20.15	And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and you

LEV.22.6	The soul which has touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.
LEV.22.7	And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it 
LEV.22.8	That which dies of itself, or is torn 
LEV.22.9	They shall therefore keep my ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they Profane 
LEV.22.10	There shall no stranger eat

LEV.26.20	And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.
LEV.26.21	And if you
LEV.26.22	I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your 
LEV.26.23	And if you
LEV.26.24	Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.
LEV.26.25	And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of

LEV.26.34	Then shall the land enjoy her Shabbat, as long as it lies desolate, and you
LEV.26.35	As long as it lies desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your Shabbat, when you
LEV.26.36	And upon them that are left

NUM.12.5	And the 
NUM.12.6	And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, 
NUM.12.7	My servant Moshe 
NUM.12.8	With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the 
NUM.12.9	And the anger of the 
NUM.12.10	And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miryam 
NUM.12.11	And Aharon 
NUM.12.12	Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother’s womb.
NUM.12.13	And Moshe 
NUM.12.14	And the 
NUM.12.15	And Miryam 
NUM.12.16	And afterward the people removed from Hatzerot 
NUM.13.1	And the 
NUM.13.2	Send you
NUM.13.3	And Moshe 
NUM.13.4	And these 
NUM.13.5	Of the tribe of Shim’on 
NUM.13.6	Of the tribe of Y’hudah 
NUM.13.7	Of the tribe of Yissakhar

NUM.13.17	And Moshe 
NUM.13.18	And see the land, what it 
NUM.13.19	And what the land 
NUM.13.20	And what the land 
NUM.13.21	So they went up, and searched the land from the Wilderness of Tzin 
NUM.13.22	And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hevron 
NUM.13.23	And they came unto the brook of Eshkol 
NUM.13.24	The place was called the brook Eshkol 
NUM.13.25	And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.
NUM.13.26	And they went and came to Moshe 
NUM.13.27	And they told him, and said, We came unto the land to which you
NUM.13.28	Nevertheless the people 
NUM.13.29	The ‘Amalekim 
NUM.13.30	And Kalev 
NUM.13.31	But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they 
NUM.13.32	And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the people of Yisra’el 
NUM.13.33	And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak 
NUM.14.1	And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.
NUM.14.2	And all the people of Yisra’el 
NUM.14.3	And wherefore has the 
NUM.14.4	And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Mitzrayim 
NUM.14.5	Then Moshe 
NUM.14.6	And Y’hoshua 
NUM.14.7	And they spoke unto all the company of the people of Yisra’el 
NUM.14.8	If the 
NUM.14.9	Only rebel not you
NUM.14.10	But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the 
NUM.14.11	And the 
NUM.14.12	I will strike them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of you
NUM.14.13	And Moshe 
NUM.14.14	And they will tell 
NUM.14.15	Now 
NUM.14.16	Because the 
NUM.14.17	And now, I beseech 
NUM.14.18	The 
NUM.14.19	Pardon, I beseech 
NUM.14.20	And the 
NUM.14.21	But 
NUM.14.22	Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Mitzrayim 
NUM.14.23	Surely they shall not see the land which I swore unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:
NUM.14.24	But my servant Kalev 
NUM.14.26	And the 
NUM.14.27	How long 
NUM.14.28	Say unto them, 
NUM.14.29	Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me,
NUM.14.30	Doubtless you
NUM.14.31	But your little ones, which you
NUM.14.32	But 
NUM.14.33	And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your cult prostitution, until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness.
NUM.14.34	After the number of the days in which you
NUM.14.35	I the 
NUM.14.36	And the men, which Moshe 
NUM.14.37	Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the 
NUM.14.38	But Y’hoshua 
NUM.14.39	And Moshe 
NUM.14.40	And they rose up early in the morning, and got them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we 
NUM.14.41	And Moshe 
NUM.14.42	Go not up, for the 
NUM.14.43	For the ‘Amalekim 
NUM.14.44	But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the

NUM.15.10	And you
NUM.15.11	Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid.
NUM.15.12	According to the number that you
NUM.15.13	All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a soothing aroma unto the 
NUM.15.14	And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever 
NUM.15.15	One ordinance 
NUM.15.16	One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojournes with you.
NUM.15.17	And the 
NUM.15.18	Speak unto the people of Yisra’el 
NUM.15.19	Then it shall be, that, when you
NUM.15.20	You
NUM.15.21	Of the first of your dough you
NUM.15.22	And if you
NUM.15.24	Then it shall be, if

NUM.15.26	And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the people of Yisra’el 
NUM.15.27	And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering.
NUM.15.28	And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sins ignorantly, when he sins by ignorance before the 
NUM.15.29	You

NUM.15.33	And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moshe 
NUM.15.34	And they put him in ward (in custody, with a guard; prison), because it was not declared what should be done to him.
NUM.15.35	And the 
NUM.15.36	And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the 
NUM.15.37	And the 
NUM.15.38	Speak unto the people of Yisra’el 
NUM.15.39	And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that you
NUM.15.40	That you
NUM.15.41	I 
NUM.16.1	Now Korakh 
NUM.16.2	And they rose up before Moshe 
NUM.16.3	And they gathered themselves together against Moshe 
NUM.16.4	And when Moshe 
NUM.16.5	And he spoke unto Korakh

NUM.16.24	Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korakh 
NUM.16.25	And Moshe 
NUM.16.26	And he spoke unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you

NUM.16.28	And Moshe 
NUM.16.29	If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; 
NUM.16.30	But if the

DEU.21.14	And it shall be, if you
DEU.21.15	If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, 
DEU.21.16	Then it shall be, when he makes his sons to inherit 
DEU.21.17	But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated 
DEU.21.18	If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and

DEU.22.15	Then shall the father of the girl, and her mother, take and bring forth 
DEU.22.16	And the girl’s father shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hates her;
DEU.22.17	And, lo, he has given occasions of speech 
DEU.22.18	And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;
DEU.22.19	And they shall amerce 
DEU.22.20	But if this thing be true, 
DEU.22.21	Then they shall bring out the girl to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she has wrought folly in Yisra’el 
DEU.22.22	If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, 
DEU.22.23	If a girl 
DEU.22.24	Then you

DEU.24.3	And 
DEU.24.4	Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that 
DEU.24.5	When a man has taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: 
DEU.24.6	No man shall take the lower or the upper millstone to pledge: for he takes

DEU.25.6	And it shall be, 
DEU.25.7	And if the man like not to take his brother’s wife, then let his brother’s wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband’s brother refuses to raise up unto his brother a name in Yisra’el 
DEU.25.8	Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and 
DEU.25.9	Then shall his brother’s wife come unto him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother’s house.

DEU.29.28	And the 
DEU.29.29	The secret 
DEU.30.1	And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon you
DEU.30.2	And shall return unto the 
DEU.30.3	That then the 
DEU.30.4	If 
DEU.30.5	And the 
DEU.30.6	And the 
DEU.30.7	And the 
DEU.30.8	And you
DEU.30.9	And the 
DEU.30.10	If you
DEU.30.11	For this commandment which I command you
DEU.30.12	It 
DEU.30.13	Neither 
DEU.30.14	But the word 
DEU.30.15	See, I have set before you
DEU.30.16	In that I command you
DEU.30.17	But if you
DEU.30.18	I denounce unto you this day, that you
DEU.30.19	I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, 
DEU.30.20	That you
DEU.31.1	And Moshe 
DEU.31.2	And he said unto them, I 
DEU.31.3	The 
DEU.31.4	And the 
DEU.31.5	And the 
DEU.31.6	Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the 
DEU.31.7	And Moshe 
DEU.31.8	And the 
DEU.31.9	And Moshe 
DEU.31.10	And Moshe 
DEU.31.11	When all Yisra’el 
DEU.31.12	Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and you
DEU.31.13	And 
DEU.31.14	And the 
DEU.31.15	And the 
DEU.31.16	And the 
DEU.31.17	Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God-Elōhīm 
DEU.31.18	And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.
DEU.31.19	Now therefore write you
DEU.31.20	For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore unto their fathers, that flows with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.
DEU.31.21	And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I swore.
DEU.31.22	Moshe 
DEU.31.23	And he gave Y’hoshua 
DEU.31.24	And it came to pass, when Moshe 
DEU.31.25	That Moshe 
DEU.31.26	Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the 
DEU.31.27	For I know you
DEU.31.28	Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.
DEU.31.29	For I know that after my death you
DEU.31.30	And Moshe 
DEU.32.1	Give ear, O you
DEU.32.2	My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass:
DEU.32.3	Because I will publish the name of the 
DEU.32.5	They have corrupted themselves, their spot 
DEU.32.6	Do you
DEU.32.7	Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask you
DEU.32.8	When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam (Man, ground; red; earthling), he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the people of Yisra’el 
DEU.32.9	For the 
DEU.32.10	He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.
DEU.32.11	As an eagle stirs up her nest, flutters over her young, spreads abroad her wings, takes them, bears them on her wings:
DEU.32.13	He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;
DEU.32.14	Butter of cattle, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan 
DEU.32.15	But Yeshurun 
DEU.32.16	They provoked him to jealousy with strange 
DEU.32.17	They sacrificed unto devils, not to God-Elōhīm 
DEU.32.18	Of the Rock 
DEU.32.19	And when the 
DEU.32.20	And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end 
DEU.32.21	They have moved me to jealousy with 
DEU.32.22	For a fire is kindled in my anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.
DEU.32.23	I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend my arrows upon them.
DEU.32.25	The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling 
DEU.32.26	I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:
DEU.32.27	Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, 
DEU.32.28	For they 
DEU.32.29	O that they were wise, 
DEU.32.30	How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the 
DEU.32.31	For their rock 
DEU.32.32	For their vine 
DEU.32.33	Their wine 
DEU.32.35	To me 
DEU.32.36	For the 
DEU.32.37	And he shall say, Where 
DEU.32.38	Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, 
DEU.32.39	See now that I, 
DEU.32.40	For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live forever.
DEU.32.41	If I whet my glittering sword, and my hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to my enemies, and will reward them that hate me.
DEU.32.42	I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; 
DEU.32.43	Rejoice, O you
DEU.32.44	And Moshe 
DEU.32.45	And Moshe 
DEU.32.46	And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which you
DEU.32.47	For it 
DEU.32.48	And the 
DEU.32.49	Get you
DEU.32.50	And die in the mount to which you
DEU.32.51	Because you
DEU.32.52	Yet you
DEU.33.1	And this 
DEU.33.2	And he said, The 
DEU.33.3	Yes, he loved the people; all his saints 
DEU.33.4	Moshe 
DEU.33.5	And he was king in Yeshurun 
DEU.33.6	Let Re’uven 
DEU.33.7	And this 
DEU.33.8	And of Levi 
DEU.33.9	Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed you
DEU.33.10	They shall teach Ya’akov 
DEU.33.11	Bless, 
DEU.33.13	And of Yosef 
DEU.33.14	And for the precious fruits 
DEU.33.15	And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,
DEU.33.16	And for the precious things of the earth and fullness thereof, and 
DEU.33.17	His glory 
DEU.33.18	And of Z’vulun 
DEU.33.19	They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck 
DEU.33.20	And of Gad 
DEU.33.21	And he provided the first part for himself, because there, 
DEU.33.22	And of Dan 
DEU.33.23	And of Naftali 
DEU.33.24	And of Asher 
DEU.33.25	You
DEU.33.27	The eternal God-Elōhīm 
DEU.33.28	Yisra’el 
DEU.33.29	Happy 
DEU.34.1	And Moshe 
DEU.34.2	And all Naftali 
DEU.34.3	And the south 
DEU.34.4	And the 
DEU.34.5	So Moshe 
DEU.34.6	And he buried him in a valley in the land of Mo’av 
DEU.34.7	And Moshe 
DEU.34.8	And the people of Yisra’el 
DEU.34.9	And Y’hoshua 
DEU.34.10	And there arose not a prophet since in Yisra’el 
DEU.34.11	In all the signs and the wonders, which the 
DEU.34.12	And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moshe 
JOS.1.1	Now after the death of Moshe 
JOS.1.2	Moshe 
JOS.1.3	Every place that the sole of your foot shall trample upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moshe 
JOS.1.4	From the wilderness and this L’vanon 
JOS.1.5	There shall not any man be able to stand before you
JOS.1.6	Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shall you
JOS.1.7	Only be you
JOS.1.8	This book of the law shall not depart out of your
JOS.1.9	Have not I commanded you
JOS.1.10	Then Y’hoshua 
JOS.1.11	Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals 
JOS.1.12	And to the Re’uveni 
JOS.1.13	Remember the word which Moshe 
JOS.1.14	Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moshe 
JOS.1.15	Until the 
JOS.1.16	And they answered Y’hoshua 
JOS.1.17	According as we listened unto Moshe 
JOS.1.18	Whosoever 
JOS.2.1	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.2.2	And it was told the king of Yericho 
JOS.2.3	And the king of Yericho 
JOS.2.4	And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I did not know not from what place they 
JOS.2.5	And it came to pass 
JOS.2.6	But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.
JOS.2.7	And the men pursued after them the way to Yarden 
JOS.2.8	And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;
JOS.2.9	And she said unto the men, I know that the 
JOS.2.10	For we have heard how the 
JOS.2.11	And as soon as we had heard 
JOS.2.12	Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the 
JOS.2.13	And 
JOS.2.14	And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if you
JOS.2.15	Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house 
JOS.2.16	And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may you
JOS.2.17	And the men said unto her, We 
JOS.2.18	Behold, 
JOS.2.19	And it shall be, 
JOS.2.20	And if you
JOS.2.21	And she said, According unto your words, so 
JOS.2.22	And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought 
JOS.2.23	So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Y’hoshua 
JOS.2.24	And they said unto Y’hoshua 
JOS.3.1	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.3.2	And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;
JOS.3.3	And they commanded the people, saying, When you
JOS.3.4	Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that you
JOS.3.5	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.3.6	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.3.7	And the 
JOS.3.8	And you
JOS.3.9	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.3.10	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.3.11	Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord-Adon of all the earth passes over before you into Yarden 
JOS.3.12	Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Yisra’el 
JOS.3.13	And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the 
JOS.3.14	And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Yarden 
JOS.3.15	And as they that bore the ark were come unto Yarden 
JOS.3.16	That the waters which came down from above stood 
JOS.3.17	And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.4.1	And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Yarden 
JOS.4.2	Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,
JOS.4.3	And command you
JOS.4.4	Then Y’hoshua 
JOS.4.5	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.4.6	That this may be a sign among you, 
JOS.4.7	Then you
JOS.4.8	And the people of Yisra’el 
JOS.4.9	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.4.10	For the priests which bore the ark stood in the midst of Yarden 
JOS.4.11	And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the 
JOS.4.12	And the children of Re’uven 
JOS.4.13	About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the 
JOS.4.14	On that day the 
JOS.4.15	And the 
JOS.4.16	Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Yarden 
JOS.4.17	Y’hoshua 
JOS.4.18	And it came to pass, when the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.4.19	And the people came up out of Yarden 
JOS.4.20	And those twelve stones, which they took out of Yarden 
JOS.4.21	And he spoke unto the people of Yisra’el 
JOS.4.22	Then you
JOS.4.23	For the 
JOS.4.24	That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the 
JOS.5.1	And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Emori 
JOS.5.2	At that time the 
JOS.5.3	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.5.4	And this 
JOS.5.5	Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people 
JOS.5.6	For the people of Yisra’el 
JOS.5.7	And their children, 
JOS.5.8	And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.
JOS.5.9	And the 
JOS.5.10	And the people of Yisra’el 
JOS.5.11	And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the Passover, unleavened cakes, and parched 
JOS.5.12	And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the people of Yisra’el 
JOS.5.13	And it came to pass, when Y’hoshua 
JOS.5.14	And he said, No; but 
JOS.5.15	And the captain of the 
JOS.6.1	Now Yericho 
JOS.6.2	And the 
JOS.6.3	And you
JOS.6.4	And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams’ horns: and the seventh day you
JOS.6.5	And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long 
JOS.6.6	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.6.7	And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass 
JOS.6.8	And it came to pass, when Y’hoshua 
JOS.6.9	And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, 
JOS.6.10	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.6.11	So the ark of the 
JOS.6.12	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.6.13	And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the 
JOS.6.14	And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.
JOS.6.15	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.
JOS.6.16	And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Y’hoshua 
JOS.6.17	And the city shall be accursed, 
JOS.6.18	And you
JOS.6.19	But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, 
JOS.6.20	So the people shouted when 
JOS.6.21	And they utterly destroyed all that 
JOS.6.22	But Y’hoshua 
JOS.6.23	And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rachav 
JOS.6.24	And they burnt the city with fire, and all that 
JOS.6.25	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.6.26	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.6.27	So the 
JOS.7.1	But the people of Yisra’el 
JOS.7.2	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.7.3	And they returned to Y’hoshua 
JOS.7.4	So there went up there of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of ‘Ai 
JOS.7.5	And the men of ‘Ai 
JOS.7.6	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.7.7	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.7.8	O Lord-Adonai 
JOS.7.9	For the Kena’ani 
JOS.7.10	And the 
JOS.7.11	Yisra’el 
JOS.7.12	Therefore the people of Yisra’el 
JOS.7.13	Up, sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) the people, and say, Sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) yourselves against tomorrow: for thus says the 
JOS.7.14	In the morning therefore you
JOS.7.15	And it shall be, 
JOS.7.16	So Y’hoshua 
JOS.7.17	And he brought the family of Y’hudah 
JOS.7.18	And he brought his household man by man; and ‘Akhan 
JOS.7.19	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.7.20	And ‘Akhan 
JOS.7.21	When I saw among the spoils a goodly Shin’ar 
JOS.7.22	So Y’hoshua 
JOS.7.23	And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Y’hoshua 
JOS.7.24	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.7.25	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.7.26	And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the 
JOS.8.1	And the 
JOS.8.2	And you
JOS.8.3	So Y’hoshua 
JOS.8.4	And he commanded them, saying, Behold, you
JOS.8.5	And I, and all the people that 
JOS.8.7	Then you
JOS.8.8	And it shall be, when you
JOS.8.9	Y’hoshua 
JOS.8.10	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.8.11	And all the people, 
JOS.8.12	And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Beit-El 
JOS.8.13	And when they had set the people, 
JOS.8.14	And it came to pass, when the king of ‘Ai 
JOS.8.15	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.8.16	And all the people that 
JOS.8.17	And there was not a man left in ‘Ai 
JOS.8.18	And the 
JOS.8.19	And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.
JOS.8.20	And when the men of ‘Ai 
JOS.8.21	And when Y’hoshua 
JOS.8.22	And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Yisra’el 
JOS.8.23	And the king of ‘Ai 
JOS.8.24	And it came to pass, when Yisra’el 
JOS.8.25	And 
JOS.8.26	For Y’hoshua 
JOS.8.27	Only the cattle and the spoil 
JOS.8.28	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.8.29	And the king of ‘Ai 
JOS.8.30	Then Y’hoshua 
JOS.8.31	As Moshe 
JOS.8.32	And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moshe 
JOS.8.33	And all Yisra’el 
JOS.8.34	And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.
JOS.8.35	There was not a word of all that Moshe 
JOS.9.1	And it came to pass, when all the kings which 
JOS.9.2	That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Y’hoshua 
JOS.9.3	And when the inhabitants of Giv’on 
JOS.9.4	They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;
JOS.9.5	And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry 
JOS.9.6	And they went to Y’hoshua 
JOS.9.7	And the men of Yisra’el 
JOS.9.8	And they said unto Y’hoshua 
JOS.9.9	And they said unto him, From a very far country you
JOS.9.10	And all that he did to the two kings of the Emori 
JOS.9.11	For what reason our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, Take victuals 
JOS.9.12	This our bread we took hot 
JOS.9.13	And these bottles of wine, which we filled, 
JOS.9.14	And the men took of their victuals 
JOS.9.15	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.9.16	And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they 
JOS.9.17	And the people of Yisra’el 
JOS.9.18	And the people of Yisra’el 
JOS.9.19	But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the 
JOS.9.20	This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we swore unto them.
JOS.9.21	And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.
JOS.9.22	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.9.23	Now therefore you
JOS.9.24	And they answered Y’hoshua 
JOS.9.25	And now, behold, we 
JOS.9.26	And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the people of Yisra’el 
JOS.9.27	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.10.1	Now it came to pass, when Adoni-Tzedek 
JOS.10.2	That they feared greatly, because Giv’on 
JOS.10.3	For what reason Adoni-Tzedek 
JOS.10.4	Come up unto me, and help me, that we may strike Giv’on 
JOS.10.5	Therefore the five kings of the Emori 
JOS.10.6	And the men of Giv’on 
JOS.10.7	So Y’hoshua 
JOS.10.8	And the 
JOS.10.9	Y’hoshua 
JOS.10.10	And the 
JOS.10.11	And it came to pass, as they fled from before Yisra’el 
JOS.10.12	Then spoke Y’hoshua 
JOS.10.13	And the sun stood still, and the moon detained 
JOS.10.14	And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the 
JOS.10.15	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.10.16	But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah 
JOS.10.17	And it was told Y’hoshua 
JOS.10.18	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.10.19	And stay you
JOS.10.20	And it came to pass, when Y’hoshua 
JOS.10.21	And all the people returned to the camp to Y’hoshua 
JOS.10.22	Then said Y’hoshua 
JOS.10.23	And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Yerushalayim 
JOS.10.24	And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Y’hoshua 
JOS.10.25	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.10.26	And afterward Y’hoshua 
JOS.10.27	And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, 
JOS.10.28	And that day Y’hoshua 
JOS.10.29	Then Y’hoshua 
JOS.10.30	And the 
JOS.10.31	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.10.32	And the 
JOS.10.33	Then Horam king of Gezer 
JOS.10.34	And from Lakhish 
JOS.10.35	And they took it on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that 
JOS.10.36	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.10.37	And they took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that 
JOS.10.38	And Y’hoshua 
JOS.10.39	And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that 
JOS.10.40	So Y’hoshua

JDG.2.21	I also will not from this time forth 
JDG.2.22	That through them I may prove Yisra’el 
JDG.2.23	Therefore the 
JDG.3.1	Now these 
JDG.3.2	Only that the generations of the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.3.4	And they were to prove Yisra’el 
JDG.3.5	And the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.3.6	And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
JDG.3.7	And the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.3.8	Therefore the anger of the 
JDG.3.9	And when the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.3.10	And the Spirit of the 
JDG.3.11	And the land had rest forty years. And ‘Otni’el 
JDG.3.12	And the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.3.13	And he gathered unto him the children of ‘Amon 
JDG.3.14	So the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.3.15	But when the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.3.16	But Ehud 
JDG.3.17	And he brought the present unto ‘Eglon 
JDG.3.18	And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bore the present.
JDG.3.19	But he himself turned again from the quarries that 
JDG.3.20	And Ehud 
JDG.3.21	And Ehud 
JDG.3.22	And the handle also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.
JDG.3.23	Then Ehud 
JDG.3.24	When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour 
JDG.3.25	And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened 
JDG.3.26	And Ehud 
JDG.3.27	And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Efrayim 
JDG.3.28	And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the 
JDG.3.29	And they killed of Mo’av 
JDG.3.30	So Mo’av 
JDG.3.31	And after him was Shamgar 
JDG.4.1	And the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.4.2	And the 
JDG.4.3	And the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.4.4	And D’vorah 
JDG.4.5	And she dwelt under the palm tree of D’vorah 
JDG.4.6	And she sent and called Barak 
JDG.4.7	And I will draw unto you
JDG.4.8	And Barak 
JDG.4.9	And she said, I will surely go with you
JDG.4.10	And Barak 
JDG.4.11	Now Hever 
JDG.4.12	And they showed Sisra 
JDG.4.13	And Sisra 
JDG.4.14	And D’vorah 
JDG.4.15	And the 
JDG.4.16	But Barak 
JDG.4.17	However Sisra 
JDG.4.18	And Ya’el 
JDG.4.19	And he said unto her, Give me, I pray you
JDG.4.20	Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man does come and enquire of you
JDG.4.21	Then Ya’el 
JDG.4.22	And, behold, as Barak 
JDG.4.23	So God-Elōhīm 
JDG.4.24	And the hand of the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.5.1	Then sang D’vorah 
JDG.5.2	Praise you
JDG.5.3	Hear, O you
JDG.5.4	-Yehōvah 
JDG.5.5	The mountains melted from before the 
JDG.5.6	In the days of Shamgar 
JDG.5.8	They chose new gods; then 
JDG.5.9	My heart 
JDG.5.10	Speak, you
JDG.5.12	Awake, awake, D’vorah 
JDG.5.13	Then he made him that remains have dominion over the nobles among the people: the 
JDG.5.14	Out of Efrayim 
JDG.5.15	And the princes of Yissakhar 
JDG.5.16	Why dwelled you
JDG.5.17	Gil’ad 
JDG.5.18	Z’vulun 
JDG.5.19	The kings came 
JDG.5.20	They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisra [Battle Array (to put on; to clothe)].
JDG.5.21	The river of Kishon 
JDG.5.22	Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones.
JDG.5.23	Curse you
JDG.5.24	Blessed 
JDG.5.25	He asked water, 
JDG.5.26	She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen’s hammer; and with the hammer she struck Sisra 
JDG.5.27	At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
JDG.5.28	The mother of Sisra 
JDG.5.29	Her wise ladies answered her, yes, she returned answer to herself,
JDG.5.30	Have they not sped? have they 
JDG.5.31	So let all your
JDG.6.1	And the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.6.2	And the hand of Midyan 
JDG.6.3	And 
JDG.6.4	And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till you
JDG.6.5	For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; 
JDG.6.6	And Yisra’el 
JDG.6.7	And it came to pass, when the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.6.8	That the 
JDG.6.9	And I delivered you out of the hand of the Mitzri, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land;
JDG.6.10	And I said unto you, I 
JDG.6.11	And there came an angel of the 
JDG.6.12	And the angel of the 
JDG.6.13	And Gid’on 
JDG.6.14	And the 
JDG.6.15	And he said unto him, Oh my Lord-Adonai 
JDG.6.16	And the 
JDG.6.17	And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in you
JDG.6.18	Depart not hence, I pray you
JDG.6.19	And Gid’on 
JDG.6.20	And the angel of God-Elōhīm 
JDG.6.21	Then the angel of the 
JDG.6.22	And when Gid’on 
JDG.6.23	And the 
JDG.6.24	Then Gid’on 
JDG.6.25	And it came to pass the same night, that the 
JDG.6.26	And build an altar unto the 
JDG.6.27	Then Gid’on 
JDG.6.28	And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Ba’al 
JDG.6.29	And they said one to another, Who has done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gid’on 
JDG.6.30	Then the men of the city said unto Yo’ash 
JDG.6.31	And Yo’ash 
JDG.6.32	Therefore on that day he called him Yeruba’al 
JDG.6.33	Then all the Midyanim 
JDG.6.34	But the Spirit of the 
JDG.6.35	And he sent messengers throughout all M’nasheh 
JDG.6.36	And Gid’on 
JDG.6.37	Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; 
JDG.6.38	And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.
JDG.6.39	And Gid’on 
JDG.6.40	And God-Elōhīm 
JDG.7.1	Then Yeruba’al 
JDG.7.2	And the 
JDG.7.3	Now therefore come 
JDG.7.4	And the 
JDG.7.5	So he brought down the people unto the water: and the 
JDG.7.6	And the number of them that lapped, 
JDG.7.7	And the 
JDG.7.8	So the people took victuals 
JDG.7.9	And it came to pass the same night, that the 
JDG.7.10	But if you
JDG.7.11	And you
JDG.7.12	And the Midyanim 
JDG.7.13	And when Gid’on 
JDG.7.14	And his fellow answered and said, This 
JDG.7.15	And it was 
JDG.7.16	And he divided the three hundred men 
JDG.7.17	And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be 
JDG.7.18	When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that 
JDG.7.19	So Gid’on 
JDG.7.20	And the three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow 
JDG.7.21	And they stood every man in his place round about the camp: and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.
JDG.7.22	And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the 
JDG.7.23	And the men of Yisra’el 
JDG.7.24	And Gid’on 
JDG.7.25	And they took two princes of the Midyanim 
JDG.8.1	And the men of Efrayim 
JDG.8.2	And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? 
JDG.8.3	God-Elōhīm 
JDG.8.4	And Gid’on 
JDG.8.5	And he said unto the men of Sukkot 
JDG.8.6	And the princes of Sukkot 
JDG.8.7	And Gid’on 
JDG.8.8	And he went up there to P’nu’el 
JDG.8.9	And he spoke also unto the men of P’nu’el 
JDG.8.10	Now Zevach 
JDG.8.11	And Gid’on 
JDG.8.12	And when Zevach 
JDG.8.13	And Gid’on 
JDG.8.14	And caught a young man of the men of Sukkot 
JDG.8.15	And he came unto the men of Sukkot 
JDG.8.16	And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Sukkot 
JDG.8.17	And he beat down the tower of P’nu’el 
JDG.8.18	Then said he unto Zevach 
JDG.8.19	And he said, They 
JDG.8.20	And he said unto Yeter 
JDG.8.21	Then Zevach 
JDG.8.22	Then the men of Yisra’el 
JDG.8.23	And Gid’on 
JDG.8.24	And Gid’on 
JDG.8.25	And they answered, We will willingly give 
JDG.8.26	And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred 
JDG.8.27	And Gid’on 
JDG.8.28	Thus was Midyan 
JDG.8.29	And Yeruba’al 
JDG.8.30	And Gid’on 
JDG.8.31	And his concubine that 
JDG.8.32	And Gid’on 
JDG.8.33	And it came to pass, as soon as Gid’on 
JDG.8.34	And the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.8.35	Neither showed they kindness to the house of Yeruba’al 
JDG.9.1	And Avi-Melekh 
JDG.9.2	Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Sh’khem 
JDG.9.3	And his mother’s brethren spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Sh’khem 
JDG.9.4	And they gave him threescore and ten 
JDG.9.5	And he went unto his father’s house at ‘Ofrah 
JDG.9.6	And all the men of Sh’khem 
JDG.9.7	And when they told 
JDG.9.8	The trees went forth 
JDG.9.9	But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, which by me they honour God-Elōhīm 
JDG.9.10	And the trees said to the fig tree, Come you
JDG.9.11	But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?
JDG.9.12	Then said the trees unto the vine, Come you
JDG.9.13	And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheers God-Elōhīm 
JDG.9.14	Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come you
JDG.9.15	And the bramble said unto the trees, If in tyou
JDG.9.16	Now therefore, if you
JDG.9.17	(For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midyan 
JDG.9.18	And you
JDG.9.19	If you
JDG.9.20	But if not, let fire come out from Avi-Melekh 
JDG.9.21	And Toram 
JDG.9.22	When Avi-Melekh 
JDG.9.23	Then God-Elōhīm 
JDG.9.24	That the cruelty 
JDG.9.25	And the men of Sh’khem 
JDG.9.26	And Ga’al 
JDG.9.27	And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trampled 
JDG.9.28	And Ga’al 
JDG.9.29	And would to God-Elōhīm 
JDG.9.30	And when Z’vul 
JDG.9.31	And he sent messengers unto Avi-Melekh 
JDG.9.32	Now therefore up by night, you
JDG.9.33	And it shall be, 
JDG.9.34	And Avi-Melekh 
JDG.9.35	And Ga’al 
JDG.9.36	And when Ga’al 
JDG.9.37	And Ga’al 
JDG.9.38	Then said Z’vul 
JDG.9.39	And Ga’al 
JDG.9.40	And Avi-Melekh 
JDG.9.41	And Avi-Melekh 
JDG.9.42	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Avi-Melekh 
JDG.9.43	And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people 
JDG.9.44	And Avi-Melekh 
JDG.9.45	And Avi-Melekh 
JDG.9.46	And when all the men of the tower of Sh’khem 
JDG.9.47	And it was told Avi-Melekh 
JDG.9.48	And Avi-Melekh 
JDG.9.49	And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Avi-Melekh 
JDG.9.50	Then went Avi-Melekh 
JDG.9.51	But there was a strong tower within the city, and there fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut 
JDG.9.52	And Avi-Melekh 
JDG.9.53	And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Avi-Melekh’s 
JDG.9.54	Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw your
JDG.9.55	And when the men of Yisra’el 
JDG.9.56	Thus God-Elōhīm 
JDG.9.57	And all the evil of the men of Sh’khem 
JDG.10.1	And after Avi-Melekh 
JDG.10.2	And he judged Yisra’el 
JDG.10.3	And after him arose Ya’ir 
JDG.10.4	And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havot-Ya’ir 
JDG.10.5	And Ya’ir 
JDG.10.6	And the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.10.7	And the anger of the 
JDG.10.8	And that year they vexed and oppressed the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.10.9	Moreover the children of ‘Amon 
JDG.10.10	And the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.10.11	And the 
JDG.10.12	The people of Tzidon 
JDG.10.13	Yet you
JDG.10.14	Go and cry unto the gods which you
JDG.10.15	And the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.10.16	And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the 
JDG.10.17	Then the children of ‘Amon 
JDG.10.18	And the people 
JDG.11.1	Now Yiftach 
JDG.11.2	And Gil’ad 
JDG.11.3	Then Yiftach 
JDG.11.4	And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of ‘Amon 
JDG.11.5	And it was so, that when the children of ‘Amon 
JDG.11.6	And they said unto Yiftach 
JDG.11.7	And Yiftach 
JDG.11.8	And the elders of Gil’ad 
JDG.11.9	And Yiftach 
JDG.11.10	And the elders of Gil’ad 
JDG.11.11	Then Yiftach 
JDG.11.12	And Yiftach 
JDG.11.13	And the king of the children of ‘Amon 
JDG.11.14	And Yiftach 
JDG.11.15	And said unto him, Thus says Yiftach 
JDG.11.16	But when Yisra’el 
JDG.11.17	Then Yisra’el 
JDG.11.18	Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom 
JDG.11.19	And Yisra’el 
JDG.11.20	But Sichon 
JDG.11.21	And the 
JDG.11.22	And they possessed all the coasts of the Emori 
JDG.11.23	So now the 
JDG.11.24	Will not you
JDG.11.25	And now 
JDG.11.26	While Yisra’el 
JDG.11.27	For what reason I have not sinned against you
JDG.11.28	However the king of the children of ‘Amon 
JDG.11.29	Then the Spirit of the 
JDG.11.30	And Yiftach 
JDG.11.31	Then it shall be, that whatsoever comes forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of ‘Amon 
JDG.11.32	So Yiftach 
JDG.11.33	And he struck them from ‘Aeo’er 
JDG.11.34	And Yiftach 
JDG.11.35	And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! you
JDG.11.36	And she said unto him, My father, 
JDG.11.37	And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.
JDG.11.38	And he said, Go. And he sent her away 
JDG.11.39	And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her 
JDG.12.1	And the men of Efrayim 
JDG.12.2	And Yiftach 
JDG.12.3	And when I saw that you
JDG.12.4	Then Yiftach 
JDG.12.5	And the Gil’adi took the passages of Yarden 
JDG.12.6	Then said they unto him, Say now Shibbolet 
JDG.12.7	And Yiftach 
JDG.12.8	And after him Ibtzan 
JDG.12.9	And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, 
JDG.12.10	Then died Ibtzan 
JDG.12.11	And after him Elon 
JDG.12.12	And Elon 
JDG.12.13	And after him Avdon 
JDG.12.14	And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Yisra’el 
JDG.12.15	And Avdon 
JDG.13.1	And the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.13.2	And there was a certain man of Tzor’ah 
JDG.13.3	And the angel of the 
JDG.13.4	Now therefore beware, I pray you
JDG.13.5	For, lo, you
JDG.13.6	Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God-Elōhīm 
JDG.13.7	But he said unto me, Behold, you
JDG.13.8	Then Manoach 
JDG.13.9	And God-Elōhīm 
JDG.13.10	And the woman made haste, and ran, and showed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man has appeared unto me, that came unto me the 
JDG.13.11	And Manoach 
JDG.13.12	And Manoach 
JDG.13.13	And the angel of the 
JDG.13.14	She may not eat of any 
JDG.13.15	And Manoach 
JDG.13.16	And the angel of the 
JDG.13.17	And Manoach 
JDG.13.18	And the angel of the 
JDG.13.19	So Manoach 
JDG.13.20	For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the 
JDG.13.21	But the angel of the 
JDG.13.22	And Manoach 
JDG.13.23	But his wife said unto him, If the 
JDG.13.24	And the woman bore a son, and called his name Shimshon 
JDG.13.25	And the Spirit of the 
JDG.14.1	And Shimshon 
JDG.14.2	And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnah 
JDG.14.3	Then his father and his mother said unto him, 
JDG.14.4	But his father and his mother knew not that it 
JDG.14.5	Then went Shimshon 
JDG.14.6	And the Spirit of the 
JDG.14.7	And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Shimshon 
JDG.14.8	And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, 
JDG.14.9	And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion.
JDG.14.10	So his father went down unto the woman: and Shimshon 
JDG.14.11	And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.
JDG.14.12	And Shimshon 
JDG.14.13	But if you
JDG.14.14	And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.
JDG.14.15	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Shimshon 
JDG.14.16	And Shimshon’s 
JDG.14.17	And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.
JDG.14.18	And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What 
JDG.14.19	And the Spirit of the 
JDG.14.20	But Shimshon’s 
JDG.15.1	But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Shimshon 
JDG.15.2	And her father said, I truly thought that you
JDG.15.3	And Shimshon 
JDG.15.4	And Shimshon 
JDG.15.5	And when he had set the brands on fire, he let 
JDG.15.6	Then the P’lishtim 
JDG.15.7	And Shimshon 
JDG.15.8	And he struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock ‘Eitam 
JDG.15.9	Then the P’lishtim 
JDG.15.10	And the men of Y’hudah 
JDG.15.11	Then three thousand men of Y’hudah 
JDG.15.12	And they said unto him, We are come down to bind you
JDG.15.13	And they spoke unto him, saying, No; but we will bind you
JDG.15.15	And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and killed a thousand men with that.
JDG.15.16	And Shimshon 
JDG.15.17	And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramat-Lechi 
JDG.15.18	And he was sore athirst, and called on the 
JDG.15.19	But God-Elōhīm 
JDG.15.20	And he judged Yisra’el 
JDG.16.1	Then went Shimshon 
JDG.16.3	And Shimshon 
JDG.16.4	And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the Valley of Sorek 
JDG.16.5	And the lords of the P’lishtim 
JDG.16.6	And D’lilah 
JDG.16.7	And Shimshon 
JDG.16.8	Then the lords of the P’lishtim 
JDG.16.9	Now 
JDG.16.10	And D’lilah 
JDG.16.11	And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.
JDG.16.12	D’lilah 
JDG.16.13	And D’lilah 
JDG.16.14	And she fastened 
JDG.16.15	And she said unto him, How can you
JDG.16.16	And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, 
JDG.16.17	That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There has not come a razor upon my head; for I 
JDG.16.18	And when D’lilah 
JDG.16.19	And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.
JDG.16.20	And she said, The P’lishtim 
JDG.16.21	But the P’lishtim 
JDG.16.22	However the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.
JDG.16.23	Then the lords of the P’lishtim 
JDG.16.24	And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god has delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which killed many of us.
JDG.16.25	And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Shimshon 
JDG.16.26	And Shimshon 
JDG.16.27	Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the P’lishtim 
JDG.16.28	And Shimshon 
JDG.16.29	And Shimshon 
JDG.16.30	And Shimshon 
JDG.16.31	Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought 
JDG.17.1	And there was a man of mount Efrayim 
JDG.17.2	And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred 
JDG.17.3	And when he had restored the eleven hundred 
JDG.17.4	Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred 
JDG.17.5	And the man Mikhay’hu 
JDG.17.6	In those days 
JDG.17.7	And there was a young man out of Beit-Lechem 
JDG.17.8	And the man departed out of the city from Beit-Lechem 
JDG.17.9	And Mikhay’hu 
JDG.17.10	And Mikhay’hu 
JDG.17.11	And the Levi 
JDG.17.12	And Mikhay’hu 
JDG.17.13	Then said Mikhay’hu 
JDG.18.1	In those days 
JDG.18.2	And the children of Dan 
JDG.18.3	When they 
JDG.18.4	And he said unto them, Thus and thus deals Mikhay’hu 
JDG.18.5	And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray you
JDG.18.6	And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the 
JDG.18.7	Then the five men departed, and came to Layish 
JDG.18.8	And they came unto their brethren to Tzor’ah 
JDG.18.9	And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it 
JDG.18.10	When you
JDG.18.11	And there went from there of the family of the Dani 
JDG.18.12	And they went up, and pitched in Kiryat-Ye’arim 
JDG.18.13	And they passed there unto mount Efrayim 
JDG.18.14	Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Layish 
JDG.18.15	And they turned toward it, and came to the house of the young man the Levi 
JDG.18.16	And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which 
JDG.18.17	And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, 
JDG.18.18	And these went into Mikhay’hu 
JDG.18.19	And they said unto him, Hold your
JDG.18.20	And the priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod 
JDG.18.21	So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage 
JDG.18.23	And they cried unto the children of Dan 
JDG.18.24	And he said, You
JDG.18.25	And the children of Dan 
JDG.18.26	And the children of Dan 
JDG.18.27	And they took 
JDG.18.28	And 
JDG.18.29	And they called the name of the city Dan 
JDG.18.30	And the children of Dan 
JDG.18.31	And they set them up Mikhay’hu 
JDG.19.1	And it came to pass in those days, when 
JDG.19.2	And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father’s house to Beit-Lechem 
JDG.19.3	And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, 
JDG.19.4	And his father in law, the girl’s father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.
JDG.19.5	And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the girl’s father said unto his son in law, Comfort you
JDG.19.6	And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the girl’s father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray you
JDG.19.7	And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again.
JDG.19.8	And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the girl’s father said, Comfort your
JDG.19.9	And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the girl’s father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draws toward evening, I pray you wait all night: behold, the day grows to an end, lodge here, that you
JDG.19.10	But the man would not wait that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Y’vus 
JDG.19.12	And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside here into the city of a stranger, that 
JDG.19.13	And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Giv’ah 
JDG.19.14	And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them 
JDG.19.15	And they turned aside there, to go in 
JDG.19.16	And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which 
JDG.19.17	And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Where go you
JDG.19.18	And he said unto him, We 
JDG.19.19	Yet there is both straw and provender 
JDG.19.20	And the old man said, Peace 
JDG.19.21	So he brought him into his house, and gave provender 
JDG.19.23	And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, No, my brethren, 
JDG.19.24	Behold, 
JDG.19.25	But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they raped her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.
JDG.19.26	Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man’s house where her lord 
JDG.19.27	And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down 
JDG.19.28	And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But there was no answer. Then the man took her 
JDG.19.29	And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided 
JDG.19.30	And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.20.1	Then all the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.20.2	And the chief of all the people, 
JDG.20.3	(Now the children of Binyamin 
JDG.20.4	And the Levi 
JDG.20.5	And the men of Giv’ah 
JDG.20.6	And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Yisra’el 
JDG.20.7	Behold, you
JDG.20.8	And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any 
JDG.20.9	But now this 
JDG.20.10	And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Yisra’el 
JDG.20.11	So all the men of Yisra’el 
JDG.20.12	And the tribes of Yisra’el 
JDG.20.13	Now therefore deliver 
JDG.20.14	But the children of Binyamin 
JDG.20.15	And the children of Binyamin 
JDG.20.16	Among all this people 
JDG.20.17	And the men of Yisra’el 
JDG.20.18	And the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.20.19	And the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.20.20	And the men of Yisra’el 
JDG.20.21	And the children of Binyamin 
JDG.20.22	And the people the men of Yisra’el

JDG.20.32	And the children of Binyamin 
JDG.20.33	And all the men of Yisra’el 
JDG.20.34	And there came against Giv’ah 
JDG.20.35	And the 
JDG.20.36	So the children of Binyamin 
JDG.20.37	And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Giv’ah 
JDG.20.38	Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Yisra’el 
JDG.20.39	And when the men of Yisra’el 
JDG.20.40	But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Binyamini looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.
JDG.20.41	And when the men of Yisra’el 
JDG.20.42	Therefore they turned 
JDG.20.44	And there fell of Binyamin 
JDG.20.45	And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon 
JDG.20.46	So that all which fell that day of Binyamin 
JDG.20.47	But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon 
JDG.20.48	And the men of Yisra’el 
JDG.21.1	Now the men of Yisra’el 
JDG.21.2	And the people came to the house of God-Elōhīm 
JDG.21.3	And said, O 
JDG.21.4	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
JDG.21.5	And the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.21.6	And the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.21.7	How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the 
JDG.21.8	And they said, What one 
JDG.21.9	For the people were numbered, and, behold, 
JDG.21.10	And the congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the most valiant, and commanded them, saying, Go and strike the inhabitants of Yavesh-Gil’ad 
JDG.21.11	And this 
JDG.21.12	And they found among the inhabitants of Yavesh-Gil’ad 
JDG.21.13	And the whole congregation sent 
JDG.21.14	And Binyamin 
JDG.21.15	And the people repented them for Binyamin 
JDG.21.16	Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Binyamin 
JDG.21.17	And they said, 
JDG.21.18	However we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.21.19	Then they said, Behold, 
JDG.21.20	Therefore they commanded the children of Binyamin 
JDG.21.21	And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh 
JDG.21.22	And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for you
JDG.21.23	And the children of Binyamin 
JDG.21.24	And the people of Yisra’el 
JDG.21.25	In those days 
1SA.1.1	Now there was a certain man of Ramatayim-Tzofim 
1SA.1.2	And he had two wives; the name of the one 
1SA.1.3	And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the 
1SA.1.4	And when the time was that Elkanah 
1SA.1.5	But unto Hannah 
1SA.1.6	And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her be troubled 
1SA.1.7	And 
1SA.1.8	Then said Elkanah 
1SA.1.9	So Hannah 
1SA.1.10	And she 
1SA.1.11	And she vowed a vow, and said, O 
1SA.1.12	And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the 
1SA.1.13	Now Hannah 
1SA.1.14	And ‘Eli 
1SA.1.15	And Hannah 
1SA.1.16	Count not you
1SA.1.17	Then ‘Eli 
1SA.1.18	And she said, Let your
1SA.1.19	And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the 
1SA.1.20	For what reason it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah 
1SA.1.21	And the man Elkanah 
1SA.1.22	But Hannah 
1SA.1.23	And Elkanah 
1SA.1.24	And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one eifah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the 
1SA.1.25	And they killed a bullock, and brought the child to ‘Eli 
1SA.1.26	And she said, Oh my lord, 
1SA.1.27	For this child I prayed; and the 
1SA.1.28	Therefore also I have lent him to the 
1SA.2.1	And Hannah 
1SA.2.3	Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let 
1SA.2.4	The bows of the mighty men 
1SA.2.6	The 
1SA.2.7	The 
1SA.2.8	He raises up the poor out of the dust, 
1SA.2.9	He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.
1SA.2.10	The adversaries of the 
1SA.2.11	And Elkanah 
1SA.2.12	Now the sons of ‘Eli 
1SA.2.13	And the priests’ custom with the people 
1SA.2.14	And he struck 
1SA.2.15	Also before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have coocked 
1SA.2.16	And 
1SA.2.17	For what reason the sin of the young men was very great before the 
1SA.2.18	But Sh’mu’el 
1SA.2.19	Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought 
1SA.2.20	And ‘Eli 
1SA.2.21	And the 
1SA.2.22	Now ‘Eli 
1SA.2.23	And he said unto them, Why do you
1SA.2.24	No, my sons; for 
1SA.2.25	If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the 
1SA.2.26	And the child Sh’mu’el 
1SA.2.27	And there came a man of God-Elōhīm 
1SA.2.28	And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Yisra’el 
1SA.2.29	For what reason kick you
1SA.2.30	For what reason the 
1SA.2.31	Behold, the days come, that I will cut off you
1SA.2.32	And you
1SA.2.33	And the man of you
1SA.2.34	And this 
1SA.2.35	And I will raise me up a faithful priest, 
1SA.2.36	And it shall come to pass, 
1SA.3.1	And the child Sh’mu’el 
1SA.3.2	And it came to pass at that time, when ‘Eli 
1SA.3.3	And before the lamp of God-Elōhīm 
1SA.3.4	That the 
1SA.3.5	And he ran unto ‘Eli 
1SA.3.6	And the 
1SA.3.7	Now Sh’mu’el 
1SA.3.8	And the 
1SA.3.9	Therefore ‘Eli 
1SA.3.10	And the 
1SA.3.11	And the 
1SA.3.12	In that day I will perform against ‘Eli 
1SA.3.13	For I have told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knows; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.
1SA.3.14	And therefore I have sworn unto the house of ‘Eli 
1SA.3.15	And Sh’mu’el 
1SA.3.16	Then ‘Eli 
1SA.3.17	And he said, What 
1SA.3.18	And Sh’mu’el

1SA.4.2	And the P’lishtim 
1SA.4.3	And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Yisra’el 
1SA.4.4	So the people sent to Shiloh 
1SA.4.5	And when the ark of the covenant of the 
1SA.4.6	And when the P’lishtim 
1SA.4.7	And the P’lishtim 
1SA.4.8	Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these 
1SA.4.9	Be strong, and quit 
1SA.4.10	And the P’lishtim 
1SA.4.11	And the ark of God-Elōhīm 
1SA.4.12	And there ran a man of Binyamin 
1SA.4.13	And when he came, lo, ‘Eli 
1SA.4.14	And when ‘Eli 
1SA.4.15	Now ‘Eli 
1SA.4.16	And the man said unto ‘Eli 
1SA.4.17	And the messenger answered and said, Yisra’el 
1SA.4.18	And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God-Elōhīm 
1SA.4.19	And his daughter in law, Pinchas 
1SA.4.20	And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for you
1SA.4.21	And she named the child I-Khavod, saying, The glory is departed from Yisra’el 
1SA.4.22	And she said, The glory is departed from Yisra’el 
1SA.5.1	And the P’lishtim 
1SA.5.2	When the P’lishtim 
1SA.5.3	And when they of Ashdod 
1SA.5.4	And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon 
1SA.5.5	Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon’s house, trample on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod 
1SA.5.6	But the hand of the 
1SA.5.7	And when the men of Ashdod 
1SA.5.8	They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the P’lishtim 
1SA.5.9	And it was 
1SA.5.10	Therefore they sent the ark of God-Elōhīm 
1SA.5.11	So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the P’lishtim 
1SA.5.12	And the men that died not were smitten with the hemorrhoids: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
1SA.6.1	And the ark of the 
1SA.6.2	And the P’lishtim 
1SA.6.3	And they said, If you
1SA.6.4	Then said they, What 
1SA.6.5	For what reason you
1SA.6.6	For what reason then do you
1SA.6.7	Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milk cattle, on which there has come no yoke, and tie the cattle to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:
1SA.6.8	And take the ark of the 
1SA.6.9	And see, if it goes up by the way of his own coast to Beit-Shemesh 
1SA.6.10	And the men did so; and took two milk cattle, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:
1SA.6.11	And they laid the ark of the 
1SA.6.12	And the cattle took the straight way to the way of Beit-Shemesh 
1SA.6.13	And 
1SA.6.14	And the cart came into the field of Y’hoshua 
1SA.6.15	And the Levi’im 
1SA.6.16	And when the five lords of the P’lishtim

1SA.6.21	And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiryat-Ye’arim 
1SA.7.1	And the men of Kiryat-Ye’arim 
1SA.7.2	And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kiryat-Ye’arim 
1SA.7.3	And Sh’mu’el 
1SA.7.4	Then the people of Yisra’el 
1SA.7.5	And Sh’mu’el 
1SA.7.6	And they gathered together to Mitzpah 
1SA.7.7	And when the P’lishtim 
1SA.7.8	And the people of Yisra’el 
1SA.7.9	And Sh’mu’el 
1SA.7.10	And as Sh’mu’el 
1SA.7.11	And the men of Yisra’el

1SA.7.16	And he went from year to year in circuit to Beit-El 
1SA.7.17	And his return 
1SA.8.1	And it came to pass, when Sh’mu’el 
1SA.8.2	Now the name of his firstborn was Yo’el 
1SA.8.3	And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after profit, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.
1SA.8.4	Then all the elders of Yisra’el 
1SA.8.5	And said unto him, Behold, you
1SA.8.6	But the thing displeased Sh’mu’el 
1SA.8.7	And the 
1SA.8.8	According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Mitzrayim 
1SA.8.9	Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.
1SA.8.10	And Sh’mu’el 
1SA.8.11	And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint 
1SA.8.12	And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and 
1SA.8.13	And he will take your daughters 
1SA.8.14	And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive yards, 
1SA.8.15	And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.
1SA.8.16	And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put 
1SA.8.17	He will take the tenth of your sheep: and you
1SA.8.18	And you
1SA.8.19	Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Sh’mu’el 
1SA.8.20	That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.
1SA.8.21	And Sh’mu’el 
1SA.8.22	And the 
1SA.9.1	Now there was a man of Binyamin 
1SA.9.2	And he had a son, whose name 
1SA.9.3	And the asses of Kish 
1SA.9.4	And he passed through mount Efrayim 
1SA.9.6	And he said unto him, Behold now,

1SA.9.8	And the servant answered Sha’ul 
1SA.9.9	(Beforetime in Yisra’el 
1SA.9.10	Then said Sha’ul 
1SA.9.12	And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, 
1SA.9.13	As soon as you
1SA.9.14	And they went up into the city: 
1SA.9.15	Now the 
1SA.9.16	Tomorrow about this time I will send you
1SA.9.17	And when Sh’mu’el 
1SA.9.18	Then Sha’ul

1SA.9.24	And the cook took up the shoulder, and 
1SA.9.25	And when they were come down from the high place into the city, [Sh’mu’el 
1SA.9.26	And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Sh’mu’el 
1SA.10.1	Then Sh’mu’el 
1SA.10.2	When you
1SA.10.3	Then shall you

1SA.10.12	And one of the same place answered and said, But who 
1SA.10.13	And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
1SA.10.14	And Sha’ul’s

1SA.10.20	And when Sh’mu’el 
1SA.10.21	When he had caused the tribe of Binyamin 
1SA.10.22	Therefore they enquired of the 
1SA.10.23	And they ran and fetched him there: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
1SA.10.24	And Sh’mu’el 
1SA.10.25	Then Sh’mu’el 
1SA.10.26	And Sha’ul 
1SA.10.27	But the children of Belial 
1SA.11.1	Then Nachash 
1SA.11.2	And Nachash 
1SA.11.3	And the elders of Yavesh 
1SA.11.4	Then came the messengers to Giv’ah 
1SA.11.5	And, behold, Sha’ul 
1SA.11.6	And the Spirit of God-Elōhīm 
1SA.11.7	And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent 
1SA.11.8	And when he numbered them in Bezek 
1SA.11.9	And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall you
1SA.11.10	Therefore the men of Yavesh 
1SA.11.11	And it was 
1SA.11.12	And the people said unto Sh’mu’el 
1SA.11.13	And Sha’ul 
1SA.11.14	Then said Sh’mu’el 
1SA.11.15	And all the people went to Gilgal 
1SA.12.1	And Sh’mu’el 
1SA.12.2	And now, behold, the king walks before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons 
1SA.12.3	Behold, here I 
1SA.12.4	And they said, you

1SA.12.7	Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the 
1SA.12.8	When Ya’akov 
1SA.12.9	And when they forgot the 
1SA.12.10	And they cried unto the 
1SA.12.11	And the 
1SA.12.12	And when you
1SA.12.13	Now therefore behold the king whom you
1SA.12.14	If you
1SA.12.15	But if you
1SA.12.16	Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the 
1SA.12.18	So Sh’mu’el 
1SA.12.19	And all the people said unto Sh’mu’el 
1SA.12.20	And Sh’mu’el 
1SA.12.21	And turn you
1SA.12.22	For the 
1SA.12.23	Moreover as for me, God-Elōhīm 
1SA.12.24	Only fear the 
1SA.12.25	But if you
1SA.13.1	Sha’ul 
1SA.13.2	Sha’ul 
1SA.13.3	And Y’honatan 
1SA.13.4	And all Yisra’el 
1SA.13.5	And the P’lishtim 
1SA.13.6	When the men of Yisra’el 
1SA.13.7	And 
1SA.13.8	And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Sh’mu’el 
1SA.13.9	And Sha’ul 
1SA.13.10	And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Sh’mu’el 
1SA.13.11	And Sh’mu’el 
1SA.13.12	Therefore said I, The P’lishtim 
1SA.13.13	And Sh’mu’el 
1SA.13.14	But now you
1SA.13.15	And Sh’mu’el 
1SA.13.16	And Sha’ul 
1SA.13.17	And the spoilers came out of the camp of the P’lishtim 
1SA.13.18	And another company turned the way 
1SA.13.19	Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Yisra’el 
1SA.13.20	But all the Yisra’eli’s went down to the P’lishtim 
1SA.13.21	Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.
1SA.13.22	So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that 
1SA.13.23	And the Garrison 
1SA.14.1	Now it came to pass upon a day, that Y’honatan 
1SA.14.2	And Sha’ul

1SA.14.5	The forefront of the one 
1SA.14.6	And Y’honatan 
1SA.14.7	And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that 
1SA.14.8	Then said Y’honatan 
1SA.14.9	If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.
1SA.14.10	But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the 
1SA.14.11	And both of them discovered themselves unto the Garrison 
1SA.14.12	And the men of the Garrison 
1SA.14.13	And Y’honatan 
1SA.14.14	And that first slaughter, which Y’honatan 
1SA.14.15	And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the Garrison 
1SA.14.16	And the watchmen of Sha’ul 
1SA.14.17	Then said Sha’ul 
1SA.14.18	And Sha’ul 
1SA.14.19	And it came to pass, while Sha’ul 
1SA.14.20	And Sha’ul 
1SA.14.21	Moreover the ‘Evri’ot 
1SA.14.22	Likewise all the men of Yisra’el 
1SA.14.23	So the 
1SA.14.24	And the men of Yisra’el 
1SA.14.25	And all 
1SA.14.26	And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.
1SA.14.27	But Y’honatan 
1SA.14.28	Then answered one of the people, and said, Your
1SA.14.29	Then said Y’honatan 
1SA.14.30	How much more, if perhaps 
1SA.14.31	And they struck the P’lishtim 
1SA.14.32	And the people flew upon the spoil 
1SA.14.33	Then they told Sha’ul 
1SA.14.34	And Sha’ul 
1SA.14.35	And Sha’ul 
1SA.14.36	And Sha’ul 
1SA.14.37	And Sha’ul 
1SA.14.38	And Sha’ul 
1SA.14.39	For, 
1SA.14.40	Then said he unto all Yisra’el 
1SA.14.41	Therefore Sha’ul 
1SA.14.42	And Sha’ul 
1SA.14.43	Then Sha’ul 
1SA.14.44	And Sha’ul 
1SA.14.45	And the people said unto Sha’ul 
1SA.14.46	Then Sha’ul 
1SA.14.47	So Sha’ul 
1SA.14.48	And he gathered an host, and struck the ‘Amalekim 
1SA.14.49	Now the sons of Sha’ul 
1SA.14.50	And the name of Sha’ul’s 
1SA.14.51	And Kish

1SA.24.14	After whom is the king of Yisra’el 
1SA.24.15	The 
1SA.24.16	And it came to pass, when David 
1SA.24.17	And he said to David 
1SA.24.18	And you

1SA.26.19	Now therefore, I pray you
1SA.26.20	Now therefore, let not my blood fall to

1SA.28.9	And the woman said unto him, Behold, you
1SA.28.10	And Sha’ul 
1SA.28.11	Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto you
1SA.28.12	And when the woman saw Sh’mu’el 
1SA.28.13	And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what saw you
1SA.28.14	And he said unto her, What form 
1SA.28.15	And Sh’mu’el 
1SA.28.16	Then said Sh’mu’el 
1SA.28.17	And the

1SA.28.23	But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he listened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.
1SA.28.24	And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded 
1SA.28.25	And she brought 
1SA.29.1	Now the P’lishtim 
1SA.29.2	And the lords of the P’lishtim 
1SA.29.3	Then said the princes of the P’lishtim 
1SA.29.4	And the princes of the P’lishtim

1SA.30.12	And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk 
1SA.30.13	And David 
1SA.30.14	We made an invasion 
1SA.30.15	And David 
1SA.30.16	And when he had brought him down, behold,

1SA.30.20	And David 
1SA.30.21	And David 
1SA.30.22	Then answered all the wicked men and 
1SA.30.23	Then said David 
1SA.30.24	For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part 
1SA.30.25	And it was 
1SA.30.26	And when David

1SA.30.29	And to 
1SA.30.30	And to 
1SA.30.31	And to

1SA.31.2	And the P’lishtim 
1SA.31.3	And the battle went sore against Sha’ul 
1SA.31.4	Then said Sha’ul 
1SA.31.5	And when his armourbearer saw that Sha’ul 
1SA.31.6	So Sha’ul 
1SA.31.7	And when the men of Yisra’el

1SA.31.10	And they put his armour in the house of ‘Ashtarot 
1SA.31.11	And when the inhabitants of Yavesh-Gil’ad 
1SA.31.12	All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Sha’ul 
1SA.31.13	And they took their bones, and buried 
2SA.1.1	Now it came to pass after the death of Sha’ul 
2SA.1.2	It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Sha’ul 
2SA.1.3	And David 
2SA.1.4	And David 
2SA.1.5	And David 
2SA.1.6	And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa 
2SA.1.7	And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here 
2SA.1.8	And he said unto me, Who 
2SA.1.9	He said unto me again, Stand, I pray you
2SA.1.10	So I stood upon him, and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that 
2SA.1.11	Then David 
2SA.1.12	And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Sha’ul 
2SA.1.13	And David 
2SA.1.14	And David 
2SA.1.15	And David

2SA.1.23	Sha’ul 
2SA.1.24	You
2SA.1.25	How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Y’honatan 
2SA.1.26	I am distressed for you
2SA.1.27	How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
2SA.2.1	And it came to pass after this, that David 
2SA.2.2	So David

2SA.2.8	But Avner 
2SA.2.9	And made him king over Gil’ad 
2SA.2.10	Ish-Boshet 
2SA.2.11	And the time that David 
2SA.2.12	And Avner 
2SA.2.13	And Yo’av 
2SA.2.14	And Avner

2SA.2.20	Then Avner 
2SA.2.21	And Avner 
2SA.2.22	And Avner 
2SA.2.23	However he refused to turn aside: wherefore Avner 
2SA.2.24	Yo’av 
2SA.2.25	And the children of Binyamin 
2SA.2.26	Then Avner 
2SA.2.27	And Yo’av 
2SA.2.28	So Yo’av 
2SA.2.29	And Avner 
2SA.2.30	And Yo’av 
2SA.2.31	But the servants of David 
2SA.2.32	And they took up ‘Asah’el

2SA.3.2	And unto David 
2SA.3.3	And his second, Kil’av 
2SA.3.4	And the fourth, Adoniyah 
2SA.3.5	And the sixth, Yitre’am 
2SA.3.6	And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Sha’ul 
2SA.3.7	And Sha’ul 
2SA.3.8	Then was Avner 
2SA.3.9	So do God-Elōhīm 
2SA.3.10	To translate 
2SA.3.11	And he could not answer Avner 
2SA.3.12	And Avner 
2SA.3.13	And he said, Well; I will make a league with you
2SA.3.14	And David 
2SA.3.15	And Ish-Boshet 
2SA.3.16	And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bachurim 
2SA.3.17	And Avner

2SA.3.26	And when Yo’av 
2SA.3.27	And when Avner 
2SA.3.28	And afterward when David 
2SA.3.29	Let it rest on the head of Yo’av 
2SA.3.30	So Yo’av 
2SA.3.31	And David 
2SA.3.32	And they buried Avner 
2SA.3.33	And the king lamented over Avner 
2SA.3.34	Your
2SA.3.35	And when all the people came to cause David 
2SA.3.36	And all the people took notice 
2SA.3.37	For all the people and all Yisra’el 
2SA.3.38	And the king said unto his servants, Know you
2SA.3.39	And I 
2SA.4.1	And when Sha’ul’s 
2SA.4.2	And Sha’ul’s 
2SA.4.3	And the Be’erotim 
2SA.4.4	And Y’honatan 
2SA.4.5	And the sons of Rimmon 
2SA.4.6	And they came there into the midst of the house, 
2SA.4.7	For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they struck him, and killed him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and got them away through the plain all night.
2SA.4.8	And they brought the head of Ish-Boshet 
2SA.4.9	And David 
2SA.4.10	When one told me, saying, Behold, Sha’ul 
2SA.4.11	How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?
2SA.4.12	And David 
2SA.5.1	Then came all the tribes of Yisra’el 
2SA.5.2	Also in time past, when Sha’ul 
2SA.5.3	So all the elders of Yisra’el 
2SA.5.4	David 
2SA.5.5	In Hevron 
2SA.5.6	And the king and his men went to Yerushalayim 
2SA.5.7	Nevertheless David 
2SA.5.8	And David 
2SA.5.9	So David 
2SA.5.10	And David 
2SA.5.11	And Hiram 
2SA.5.12	And David 
2SA.5.13	And David 
2SA.5.14	And these 
2SA.5.15	Yivchar 
2SA.5.16	And Elishama 
2SA.5.17	But when the P’lishtim 
2SA.5.18	The P’lishtim 
2SA.5.19	And David 
2SA.5.20	And David 
2SA.5.21	And there they left their images, and David 
2SA.5.22	And the P’lishtim 
2SA.5.23	And when David 
2SA.5.24	And let it be, when you
2SA.5.25	And David 
2SA.6.1	Again, David 
2SA.6.2	And David 
2SA.6.3	And they set the ark of God-Elōhīm 
2SA.6.4	And they brought it out of the house of Avinadav 
2SA.6.5	And David 
2SA.6.6	And when they came to Nakhon’s 
2SA.6.7	And the anger of the 
2SA.6.8	And David

2SA.6.17	And they brought in the ark of the 
2SA.6.18	And as soon as David 
2SA.6.19	And he dealt among all the people, 
2SA.6.20	Then David 
2SA.6.21	And David 
2SA.6.22	And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in my own sight: and of the maidservants which you
2SA.6.23	Therefore Mikhal 
2SA.7.1	And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the 
2SA.7.2	That the king said unto Natan 
2SA.7.3	And Natan 
2SA.7.4	And it came to pass that night, that the word of the 
2SA.7.5	Go and tell my servant David 
2SA.7.6	Whereas I have not dwelt in 
2SA.7.7	In all 
2SA.7.8	Now therefore so shall you
2SA.7.9	And I was with you
2SA.7.10	Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Yisra’el 
2SA.7.11	And as since the time that I commanded 
2SA.7.12	And when you
2SA.7.13	He shall build an house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
2SA.7.14	I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:
2SA.7.15	But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took 
2SA.7.16	And you
2SA.7.17	According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Natan 
2SA.7.18	Then went king David 
2SA.7.19	And this was yet a small thing in you
2SA.7.20	And what can David

2SA.11.19	And charged the messenger, saying, When you
2SA.11.20	And if so be that the king’s wrath arise, and he say unto you
2SA.11.21	Who struck Avi-Melekh 
2SA.11.22	So the messenger went, and came and showed David 
2SA.11.23	And the messenger said unto David 
2SA.11.24	And the shooters shot from off the wall upon your
2SA.11.25	Then David 
2SA.11.26	And when the wife of Uriyah 
2SA.11.27	And when the mourning was past, David 
2SA.12.1	And the 
2SA.12.2	The rich 
2SA.12.3	But the poor 
2SA.12.4	And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.
2SA.12.5	And David’s 
2SA.12.6	And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
2SA.12.7	And Natan 
2SA.12.8	And I gave you
2SA.12.9	For what reason have you
2SA.12.10	Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your
2SA.12.11	Thus says the 
2SA.12.12	For you
2SA.12.13	And David 
2SA.12.14	However, because by this deed you
2SA.12.15	And Natan 
2SA.12.16	David 
2SA.12.17	And the elders of his house arose, 
2SA.12.18	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David 
2SA.12.19	But when David 
2SA.12.20	Then David 
2SA.12.21	Then said his servants unto him, What thing 
2SA.12.22	And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell 
2SA.12.23	But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.
2SA.12.24	And David 
2SA.12.25	And he sent by the hand of Natan 
2SA.12.26	And Yo’av 
2SA.12.27	And Yo’av 
2SA.12.28	Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.
2SA.12.29	And David 
2SA.12.30	And he took their king’s crown from off his head, the weight whereof 
2SA.12.31	And he brought forth the people that 
2SA.13.1	And it came to pass after this, that Avshalom 
2SA.13.2	And Amnon 
2SA.13.3	But Amnon 
2SA.13.4	And he said unto him, Why 
2SA.13.5	And Yonadav 
2SA.13.6	So Amnon 
2SA.13.7	Then David 
2SA.13.8	So Tamar 
2SA.13.9	And she took a pan, and poured 
2SA.13.10	And Amnon 
2SA.13.11	And when she had brought 
2SA.13.12	And she answered him, No, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Yisra’el 
2SA.13.13	And I, to which shall I cause my shame to go? and as for you
2SA.13.14	However he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.
2SA.13.15	Then Amnon 
2SA.13.16	And she said unto him, 
2SA.13.17	Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this 
2SA.13.18	And 
2SA.13.19	And Tamar 
2SA.13.20	And Avshalom 
2SA.13.21	But when king David 
2SA.13.22	And Avshalom 
2SA.13.23	And it came to pass after two full years, that Avshalom 
2SA.13.24	And Avshalom 
2SA.13.25	And the king said to Avshalom 
2SA.13.26	Then said Avshalom 
2SA.13.27	But Avshalom 
2SA.13.28	Now Avshalom 
2SA.13.29	And the servants of Avshalom 
2SA.13.30	And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David 
2SA.13.31	Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.
2SA.13.32	And Yonadav 
2SA.13.33	Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead: for Amnon 
2SA.13.34	But Avshalom 
2SA.13.35	And Yonadav 
2SA.13.36	And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.
2SA.13.37	But Avshalom 
2SA.13.38	So Avshalom 
2SA.13.39	And 
2SA.14.1	Now Yo’av 
2SA.14.2	And Yo’av 
2SA.14.3	And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Yo’av 
2SA.14.4	And when the woman of T’koa 
2SA.14.5	And the king said unto her, What ails you
2SA.14.6	And your
2SA.14.7	And, behold, the whole family is risen against your
2SA.14.8	And the king said unto the woman, Go to your
2SA.14.9	And the woman of T’koa 
2SA.14.10	And the king said, Whosoever says 
2SA.14.11	Then said she, I pray you
2SA.14.12	Then the woman said, Let your
2SA.14.13	And the woman said, For what reason then have you
2SA.14.14	For we must needs die, and 
2SA.14.15	Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, 
2SA.14.16	For the king will hear, to deliver his female servant out of the hand of the man 
2SA.14.17	Then your
2SA.14.18	Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray you
2SA.14.19	And the king said, 
2SA.14.20	To fetch about this form of speech has your
2SA.14.21	And the king said unto Yo’av 
2SA.14.22	And Yo’av 
2SA.14.23	So Yo’av 
2SA.14.24	And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Avshalom 
2SA.14.25	But in all Yisra’el 
2SA.14.26	And when he cut hair from his head, (for it was at every year’s end that he polled 
2SA.14.27	And unto Avshalom 
2SA.14.28	So Avshalom 
2SA.14.29	Therefore Avshalom 
2SA.14.30	Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Yo’av 
2SA.14.31	Then Yo’av 
2SA.14.32	And Avshalom 
2SA.14.33	So Yo’av 
2SA.15.1	And it came to pass after this, that Avshalom 
2SA.15.2	And Avshalom 
2SA.15.3	And Avshalom 
2SA.15.4	Avshalom 
2SA.15.5	And it was 
2SA.15.6	And on this manner did Avshalom 
2SA.15.7	And it came to pass after forty years, that Avshalom 
2SA.15.8	For you
2SA.15.9	And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hevron 
2SA.15.10	But Avshalom 
2SA.15.11	And with Avshalom 
2SA.15.12	And Avshalom 
2SA.15.13	And there came a messenger to David 
2SA.15.14	And David 
2SA.15.15	And the king’s servants said unto the king, Behold, your
2SA.15.16	And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, 
2SA.15.17	And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.
2SA.15.18	And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the K’reti 
2SA.15.19	Then said the king to Ittai 
2SA.15.20	Whereas you
2SA.15.21	And Ittai 
2SA.15.22	And David 
2SA.15.23	And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron 
2SA.15.24	And lo Tzadok 
2SA.15.25	And the king said unto Tzadok 
2SA.15.26	But if he thus say, I have no delight in you
2SA.15.27	The king said also unto Tzadok 
2SA.15.28	See, I will wait in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.
2SA.15.29	Tzadok 
2SA.15.30	And David 
2SA.15.31	And 
2SA.15.32	And it came to pass, that 
2SA.15.33	Unto whom David 
2SA.15.34	But if you
2SA.15.35	And 
2SA.15.36	Behold, 
2SA.15.37	So Hushai 
2SA.16.1	And when David 
2SA.16.2	And the king said unto Tziva 
2SA.16.3	And the king said, And where 
2SA.16.4	Then said the king to Tziva 
2SA.16.5	And when king David 
2SA.16.6	And he cast stones at David 
2SA.16.7	And thus said Shime’i 
2SA.16.8	The 
2SA.16.9	Then said Avishai 
2SA.16.10	And the king said, What have I to do with you, you
2SA.16.11	And David 
2SA.16.12	It may be that the 
2SA.16.13	And as David 
2SA.16.14	And the king, and all the people that 
2SA.16.15	And Avshalom 
2SA.16.16	And it came to pass, when Hushai 
2SA.16.17	And Avshalom 
2SA.16.18	And Hushai 
2SA.16.19	And again, whom should I serve? 
2SA.16.20	Then said Avshalom 
2SA.16.21	And Achitofel 
2SA.16.22	So they spread Avshalom 
2SA.16.23	And the counsel of Achitofel 
2SA.17.1	Moreover Achitofel 
2SA.17.2	And I will come upon him while he 
2SA.17.3	And I will bring back all the people unto you
2SA.17.4	And the saying pleased Avshalom 
2SA.17.5	Then said Avshalom 
2SA.17.6	And when Hushai 
2SA.17.7	And Hushai 
2SA.17.8	For, said Hushai 
2SA.17.9	Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some 
2SA.17.10	And he also 
2SA.17.11	Therefore I counsel that all Yisra’el 
2SA.17.12	So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falls on the ground: and of him and of all the men that 
2SA.17.13	Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Yisra’el 
2SA.17.14	And Avshalom 
2SA.17.15	Then said Hushai 
2SA.17.16	Now therefore send quickly, and tell David 
2SA.17.17	Now Y’honatan 
2SA.17.18	Nevertheless a boy saw them, and told Avshalom 
2SA.17.19	And the woman took and spread a covering over the well’s mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.
2SA.17.20	And when Avshalom 
2SA.17.21	And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David 
2SA.17.22	Then David 
2SA.17.23	And when Achitofel 
2SA.17.24	Then David 
2SA.17.25	And Avshalom 
2SA.17.26	So Yisra’el 
2SA.17.27	And it came to pass, when David 
2SA.17.28	Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched 
2SA.17.29	And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of cattle, for David 
2SA.18.1	And David 
2SA.18.2	And David 
2SA.18.3	But the people answered, you
2SA.18.4	And the king said unto them, What seems you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.
2SA.18.5	And the king commanded Yo’av 
2SA.18.6	So the people went out into the field against Yisra’el 
2SA.18.7	Where the people of Yisra’el 
2SA.18.8	For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
2SA.18.9	And Avshalom 
2SA.18.10	And a certain man saw 
2SA.18.11	And Yo’av 
2SA.18.12	And the man said unto Yo’av 
2SA.18.13	Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against my own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and you
2SA.18.14	Then said Yo’av 
2SA.18.15	And ten young men that bore Yo’av 
2SA.18.16	And Yo’av 
2SA.18.17	And they took Avshalom 
2SA.18.18	Now Avshalom 
2SA.18.19	Then said Achima’atz [my brother is anger (wrath)] the son of Tzadok 
2SA.18.20	And Yo’av 
2SA.18.21	Then said Yo’av 
2SA.18.22	Then said Achima’atz 
2SA.18.23	But howsoever, 
2SA.18.24	And David 
2SA.18.25	And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he 
2SA.18.26	And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold 
2SA.18.27	And the watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Achima’atz 
2SA.18.28	And Achima’atz 
2SA.18.29	And the king said, Is the young man Avshalom 
2SA.18.30	And the king said 
2SA.18.31	And, behold, Kushi 
2SA.18.32	And the king said unto Kushi 
2SA.18.33	And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Avshalom 
2SA.19.1	And it was told Yo’av 
2SA.19.2	And the victory that day was 
2SA.19.3	And the people got them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.
2SA.19.4	But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Avshalom 
2SA.19.5	And Yo’av 
2SA.19.6	In that you
2SA.19.7	Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto you
2SA.19.8	Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king does sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Yisra’el 
2SA.19.9	And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Yisra’el 
2SA.19.10	And Avshalom 
2SA.19.11	And king David 
2SA.19.12	You
2SA.19.13	And say you
2SA.19.14	And he bowed the heart of all the men of Y’hudah 
2SA.19.15	So the king returned, and came to Yarden 
2SA.19.16	And Shime’i 
2SA.19.17	And 
2SA.19.18	And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good. And Shime’i 
2SA.19.19	And said unto the king, Let not my lord impiute 
2SA.19.20	For you
2SA.19.21	But Avishai 
2SA.19.22	And David 
2SA.19.23	Therefore the king said unto Shime’i 
2SA.19.24	And M’fivoshet 
2SA.19.25	And it came to pass, when he was come to Yerushalayim 
2SA.19.26	And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for you
2SA.19.27	And he has slandered you
2SA.19.28	For all 
2SA.19.29	And the king said unto him, Why speak you
2SA.19.30	And M’fivoshet 
2SA.19.31	And Barzillai 
2SA.19.32	Now Barzillai 
2SA.19.33	And the king said unto Barzillai 
2SA.19.34	And Barzillai 
2SA.19.35	I 
2SA.19.36	You
2SA.19.37	Let your
2SA.19.38	And the king answered, Khimham 
2SA.19.39	And all the people went over Yarden 
2SA.19.40	Then the king went on to Gilgal 
2SA.19.41	And, behold, all the men of Yisra’el 
2SA.19.42	And all the men of Y’hudah 
2SA.19.43	And the men of Yisra’el 
2SA.20.1	And there happened to be there a man of Belial 
2SA.20.2	So every man of Yisra’el 
2SA.20.3	And David 
2SA.20.4	Then said the king to ‘Amasa 
2SA.20.5	So ‘Amasa 
2SA.20.6	And David 
2SA.20.7	And there went out after him Yo’av 
2SA.20.8	When they 
2SA.20.9	And Yo’av 
2SA.20.10	But ‘Amasa 
2SA.20.11	And one of Yo’av 
2SA.20.12	And ‘Amasa 
2SA.20.13	When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Yo’av 
2SA.20.14	And he went through all the tribes of Yisra’el 
2SA.20.15	And they came and besieged him in Hevel 
2SA.20.16	Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Yo’av 
2SA.20.17	And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, 
2SA.20.18	Then she spoke, saying, They were wont 
2SA.20.19	I 
2SA.20.20	And Yo’av 
2SA.20.21	The matter 
2SA.20.22	Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheva 
2SA.20.23	Now Yo’av 
2SA.20.24	And Adoram 
2SA.20.25	And Sheva 
2SA.20.26	And ‘Ira 
2SA.21.1	Then there was a famine in the days of David 
2SA.21.2	And the king called the Giv’onim 
2SA.21.3	For what reason David 
2SA.21.4	And the Giv’onim 
2SA.21.5	And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us 
2SA.21.6	Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the 
2SA.21.7	But the king spared M’fivoshet 
2SA.21.8	But the king took the two sons of Ritzpah 
2SA.21.9	And he delivered them into the hands of the Giv’onim 
2SA.21.10	And Ritzpah 
2SA.21.11	And it was told David 
2SA.21.12	And David 
2SA.21.13	And he brought up from there the bones of Sha’ul 
2SA.21.14	And the bones of Sha’ul 
2SA.21.15	Moreover the P’lishtim 
2SA.21.16	And Yishbi-B’nov 
2SA.21.17	But Avishai 
2SA.21.18	And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the P’lishtim 
2SA.21.19	And there was again a battle in Gov 
2SA.21.20	And there was yet a battle in Gat 
2SA.21.21	And when he defied Yisra’el 
2SA.21.22	These four were born to the giant in Gat 
2SA.22.1	And David 
2SA.22.2	And he said, The 
2SA.22.3	The God-Elōhīm 
2SA.22.4	I will call on the 
2SA.22.5	When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;
2SA.22.6	The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;
2SA.22.7	In my distress I called upon the 
2SA.22.8	Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was exceedingly angry.
2SA.22.9	There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
2SA.22.10	He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness 
2SA.22.11	And he rode upon a cherub 
2SA.22.12	And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, 
2SA.22.13	Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.
2SA.22.14	The 
2SA.22.15	And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and scattered 
2SA.22.16	And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the 
2SA.22.17	He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;
2SA.22.18	He delivered me from my strong enemy, 
2SA.22.19	They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the 
2SA.22.20	He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
2SA.22.21	The 
2SA.22.22	For I have kept the ways of the 
2SA.22.23	For all his judgments 
2SA.22.24	I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from my iniquity.
2SA.22.25	Therefore the 
2SA.22.26	With the merciful you
2SA.22.27	With the pure you
2SA.22.28	And the afflicted people you
2SA.22.29	For you
2SA.22.30	For by you
2SA.22.32	For who 
2SA.22.33	God-Elōhīm 
2SA.22.34	He makes my feet like hinds’ 
2SA.22.35	He teaches my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by my arms.
2SA.22.36	you
2SA.22.37	you
2SA.22.38	I have pursued my enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.
2SA.22.39	And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yes, they are fallen under my feet.
2SA.22.40	For you
2SA.22.41	you
2SA.22.42	They looked, but 
2SA.22.43	Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, 
2SA.22.44	you
2SA.22.45	Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.
2SA.22.46	Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.
2SA.22.47	The 
2SA.22.48	It 
2SA.22.49	And that brings me forth from my enemies: you
2SA.22.50	Therefore I will give thanks unto you
2SA.23.1	Now these 
2SA.23.2	The Spirit of the 
2SA.23.3	The God-Elōhīm 
2SA.23.4	And 
2SA.23.5	Although my house 
2SA.23.6	But 
2SA.23.7	But the man

2SA.23.12	But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and killed the P’lishtim 
2SA.23.13	And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David 
2SA.23.14	And David 
2SA.23.15	And David 
2SA.23.16	And the three mighty men broke through the host of the P’lishtim 
2SA.23.17	And he said, Be it far from me, O

2SA.24.3	And Yo’av 
2SA.24.4	Yet the king’s word prevailed against Yo’av 
2SA.24.5	And they passed over Yarden 
2SA.24.6	Then they came to Gil’ad 
2SA.24.7	And came to the strong hold of Tzor 
2SA.24.8	So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Yerushalayim 
2SA.24.9	And Yo’av 
2SA.24.10	And David’s 
2SA.24.11	For when David 
2SA.24.12	Go and say unto David

2SA.24.22	And Aravnah 
2SA.24.23	All these 
2SA.24.24	And the king said unto Aravnah 
2SA.24.25	And David 
1KI.1.1	Now king David 
1KI.1.2	For what reason his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in your
1KI.1.3	So they sought for a fair girl throughout all the coasts of Yisra’el 
1KI.1.4	And the girl 
1KI.1.5	Then Adoniyah 
1KI.1.6	And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why have you
1KI.1.7	And he conferred with Yo’av 
1KI.1.8	But Tzadok 
1KI.1.9	And Adoniyah 
1KI.1.10	But Natan 
1KI.1.11	For what reason Natan 
1KI.1.12	Now therefore come, let me, I pray you
1KI.1.13	Go and get you
1KI.1.14	Behold, while you
1KI.1.15	And Bat-Sheva 
1KI.1.16	And Bat-Sheva 
1KI.1.17	And she said unto him, My lord, you
1KI.1.18	And now, behold, Adoniyah 
1KI.1.19	And he has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, and Avyatar 
1KI.1.20	And you
1KI.1.21	Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Shlomo 
1KI.1.22	And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Natan 
1KI.1.23	And they told the king, saying, Behold Natan 
1KI.1.24	And Natan 
1KI.1.25	For he is gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and Avyatar 
1KI.1.26	But me, 
1KI.1.27	Is this thing done by my lord the king, and you
1KI.1.28	Then king David 
1KI.1.29	And the king swore, and said, 
1KI.1.30	Even as I swore unto you
1KI.1.31	Then Bat-Sheva 
1KI.1.32	And king David 
1KI.1.33	The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Shlomo 
1KI.1.34	And let Tzadok

1KI.1.46	And also Shlomo 
1KI.1.47	And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David 
1KI.1.48	And also thus said the king, Blessed 
1KI.1.49	And all the guests that 
1KI.1.50	And Adoniyah 
1KI.1.51	And it was told Shlomo 
1KI.1.52	And Shlomo 
1KI.1.53	So king Shlomo 
1KI.2.1	Now the days of David 
1KI.2.2	I go the way of all the earth: be you
1KI.2.3	And keep the charge of the 
1KI.2.4	That the 
1KI.2.5	Moreover you
1KI.2.6	Do therefore according to your
1KI.2.7	But show kindness unto the sons of Barzillai 
1KI.2.8	And, behold, 
1KI.2.9	Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for you
1KI.2.10	So David 
1KI.2.11	And the days that David 
1KI.2.12	Then sat Shlomo 
1KI.2.13	And Adoniyah 
1KI.2.14	He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto you
1KI.2.15	And he said, you
1KI.2.16	And now I ask one petition of you
1KI.2.17	And he said, Speak, I pray you
1KI.2.18	And Bat-Sheva 
1KI.2.19	Bat-Sheva 
1KI.2.20	Then she said, I desire one small petition of you
1KI.2.21	And she said, Let Avishag 
1KI.2.22	And king Shlomo 
1KI.2.23	Then king Shlomo 
1KI.2.24	Now therefore, 
1KI.2.25	And king Shlomo 
1KI.2.26	And unto Avyatar 
1KI.2.27	So Shlomo 
1KI.2.28	Then tidings came to Yo’av 
1KI.2.29	And it was told king Shlomo 
1KI.2.30	And B’nayahu 
1KI.2.31	And the king said unto him, Do as he has said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that you
1KI.2.32	And the 
1KI.2.33	Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Yo’av 
1KI.2.34	So B’nayahu 
1KI.2.35	And the king put B’nayahu 
1KI.2.36	And the king sent and called for Shime’i 
1KI.2.37	For it shall be, 
1KI.2.38	And Shime’i 
1KI.2.39	And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shime’i 
1KI.2.40	And Shime’i 
1KI.2.41	And it was told Shlomo 
1KI.2.42	And the king sent and called for Shime’i 
1KI.2.43	Why then have you
1KI.2.44	The king said moreover to Shime’i 
1KI.2.45	And king Shlomo 
1KI.2.46	So the king commanded B’nayahu 
1KI.3.1	And Shlomo 
1KI.3.2	Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the 
1KI.3.3	And Shlomo 
1KI.3.4	And the king went to Giv’on 
1KI.3.5	In Giv’on 
1KI.3.6	And Shlomo 
1KI.3.7	And now, O 
1KI.3.8	And your
1KI.3.9	Give therefore your
1KI.3.10	And the speech pleased the Lord-Adonai 
1KI.3.11	And God-Elōhīm 
1KI.3.12	Behold, I have done according to your
1KI.3.13	And I have also given you
1KI.3.14	And if you
1KI.3.15	And Shlomo 
1KI.3.16	Then came there two women, 
1KI.3.17	And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
1KI.3.18	And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we 
1KI.3.19	And this woman’s child died in the night; because she overlaid it.
1KI.3.20	And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while your
1KI.3.21	And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.
1KI.3.22	And the other woman said, No; but the living 
1KI.3.23	Then said the king, The one says, This 
1KI.3.24	And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.
1KI.3.25	And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.
1KI.3.26	Then spoke the woman whose the living child 
1KI.3.27	Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and assuredly not 
1KI.3.28	And all Yisra’el 
1KI.4.1	So king Shlomo 
1KI.4.2	And these 
1KI.4.3	Elichoref 
1KI.4.4	And B’nayahu 
1KI.4.5	And ‘Azaryah

1KI.4.21	And Shlomo 
1KI.4.22	And Shlomo’s 
1KI.4.23	Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallow 
1KI.4.24	For he had dominion over all 
1KI.4.25	And Y’hudah 
1KI.4.26	And Shlomo 
1KI.4.27	And those officers provided victual for king Shlomo 
1KI.4.28	Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where 
1KI.4.29	And God-Elōhīm

1KI.4.32	And he spoke three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.
1KI.4.33	And he spoke of trees, from the cedar tree that 
1KI.4.34	And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Shlomo

1KI.6.6	The nethermost chamber 
1KI.6.7	And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought there: so that there was neither hammer nor axe 
1KI.6.8	The door for the middle chamber 
1KI.6.9	So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.
1KI.6.10	And 
1KI.6.11	And the word of the 
1KI.6.13	And I will dwell among the people of Yisra’el 
1KI.6.14	So Shlomo 
1KI.6.15	And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling:

1KI.6.21	So Shlomo 
1KI.6.22	And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that 
1KI.6.23	And within the oracle he made two k’vurim 
1KI.6.24	And five cubits 
1KI.6.25	And the other cherub 
1KI.6.26	The height of the one cherub 
1KI.6.27	And he set the k’vurim

1KI.13.12	And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God-Elōhīm 
1KI.13.13	And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,
1KI.13.14	And went after the man of God-Elōhīm 
1KI.13.15	Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
1KI.13.16	And he said, I may not return with you
1KI.13.17	For it was said to me by the word of the

1KI.13.28	And he went and found his carcass cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcass: the lion had not eaten the carcass, nor torn the ass.
1KI.13.29	And the prophet took up the carcass of the man of God-Elōhīm 
1KI.13.30	And he laid his carcass in his own grave; and they mourned over him, 
1KI.13.31	And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulcher wherein the man of God-Elōhīm

1KI.20.28	And there came a man of God-Elōhīm 
1KI.20.29	And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And 
1KI.20.30	But the rest fled to Aphek 
1KI.20.31	And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Yisra’el 
1KI.20.32	So they girded sackcloth on their waist, and 
1KI.20.33	Now the men did diligently observe whether

1KI.20.37	Then he found another man, and said, Strike me, I pray you
1KI.20.38	So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with bandages over his eyes.
1KI.20.39	And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Your
1KI.20.40	And as your
1KI.20.41	And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Yisra’el 
1KI.20.42	And he said unto him, Thus says the 
1KI.20.43	And the king of Yisra’el 
1KI.21.1	And it came to pass after these things, 
1KI.21.2	And Ach’av 
1KI.21.3	And Navot 
1KI.21.4	And Ach’av 
1KI.21.5	But Izevel 
1KI.21.6	And he said unto her, Because I spoke unto Navot 
1KI.21.7	And Izevel 
1KI.21.8	So she wrote letters in Ach’av’s 
1KI.21.9	And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Navot 
1KI.21.10	And set two men, sons of Belial 
1KI.21.11	And the men of his city, 
1KI.21.12	They proclaimed a fast, and set Navot 
1KI.21.13	And there came in two men, children of Belial

1KI.21.19	And you
1KI.21.20	And Ach’av 
1KI.21.21	Behold, I will bring evil upon you
1KI.21.22	And will make your

1KI.21.24	Him that dies of Ach’av 
1KI.21.25	But there was none like unto Ach’av 
1KI.21.26	And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all 
1KI.21.27	And it came to pass, when Ach’av 
1KI.21.28	And the word of the 
1KI.21.29	See you

1KI.22.4	And he said unto Y’hoshafat 
1KI.22.5	And Y’hoshafat 
1KI.22.6	Then the king of Yisra’el 
1KI.22.7	And Y’hoshafat 
1KI.22.8	And the king of Yisra’el 
1KI.22.9	Then the king of Yisra’el 
1KI.22.10	And the king of Yisra’el 
1KI.22.11	And Tzidkiyah 
1KI.22.12	And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramot-Gil’ad 
1KI.22.13	And the messenger that was gone to call Mikhay’hu 
1KI.22.14	And Mikhay’hu 
1KI.22.15	So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Mikhay’hu 
1KI.22.16	And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure 
1KI.22.17	And he said, I saw all Yisra’el 
1KI.22.18	And the king of Yisra’el 
1KI.22.19	And he said, Hear you

1KI.22.36	And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.
1KI.22.37	So the king died, and was brought to Shomron 
1KI.22.38	And 
1KI.22.39	Now the rest of the acts of Ach’av 
1KI.22.40	So Ach’av

1KI.22.50	And Y’hoshafat 
1KI.22.51	Achazyah 
1KI.22.52	And he did evil in the sight of the

2KI.1.1	Then Mo’av 
2KI.1.2	And Achazyah 
2KI.1.3	But the angel of the

2KI.1.5	And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are you
2KI.1.6	And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus says the 
2KI.1.7	And he said unto them, What manner of man 
2KI.1.8	And they answered him, 
2KI.1.9	Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spoke unto him, you
2KI.1.10	And Eliyahu 
2KI.1.11	Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God-Elōhīm 
2KI.1.12	And Eliyahu 
2KI.1.13	And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Eliyahu 
2KI.1.14	Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in your

2KI.2.5	And the sons of the prophets that 
2KI.2.6	And Eliyahu 
2KI.2.7	And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Yarden 
2KI.2.8	And Eliyahu 
2KI.2.9	And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Eliyahu 
2KI.2.10	And he said, you
2KI.2.11	And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, 
2KI.2.12	And Eli-sha 
2KI.2.13	He took up also the Mantle 
2KI.2.14	And he took the Mantle 
2KI.2.15	And when the sons of the prophets which 
2KI.2.16	And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with your
2KI.2.17	And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.
2KI.2.18	And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Yericho 
2KI.2.19	And the men of the city said unto Eli-sha 
2KI.2.20	And he said, Bring me a new jug, and put salt in it. And they brought 
2KI.2.21	And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus says the 
2KI.2.22	So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Eli-sha 
2KI.2.23	And he went up from there unto Beit-El 
2KI.2.24	And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the 
2KI.2.25	And he went from there to mount Carmel 
2KI.3.1	Now Y’horam 
2KI.3.2	And he wrought evil in the sight of the 
2KI.3.3	Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Yarov’am 
2KI.3.4	And Mesha 
2KI.3.5	But it came to pass, when Ach’av 
2KI.3.6	And king Y’horam 
2KI.3.7	And he went and sent to Y’hoshafat 
2KI.3.8	And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom 
2KI.3.9	So the king of Yisra’el 
2KI.3.10	And the king of Yisra’el 
2KI.3.11	But Y’hoshafat 
2KI.3.12	And Y’hoshafat

2KI.3.17	For thus says the 
2KI.3.18	And this is 
2KI.3.19	And you
2KI.3.20	And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom 
2KI.3.21	And when all the Mo’avi 
2KI.3.22	And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Mo’avi 
2KI.3.23	And they said, This 
2KI.3.24	And when they came to the camp of Yisra’el 
2KI.3.25	And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kir-Hareset 
2KI.3.26	And when the king of Mo’av 
2KI.3.27	Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him 
2KI.4.1	Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Eli-sha 
2KI.4.2	And Eli-sha 
2KI.4.3	Then he said, Go, borrow you
2KI.4.4	And when you
2KI.4.5	So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought 
2KI.4.6	And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me another vessel. And he said unto her, 
2KI.4.7	Then she came and told the man of God-Elōhīm 
2KI.4.8	And it fell on a day, that Eli-sha 
2KI.4.9	And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this 
2KI.4.10	Let us make a little chamber, I pray you
2KI.4.11	And it fell on a day, that he came there, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.
2KI.4.12	And he said to Geichazi 
2KI.4.13	And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, you
2KI.4.14	And he said, What then 
2KI.4.15	And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.
2KI.4.16	And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, you
2KI.4.17	And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that season that Eli-sha 
2KI.4.18	And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.
2KI.4.19	And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a boy, Carry him to his mother.
2KI.4.20	And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and 
2KI.4.21	And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God-Elōhīm 
2KI.4.22	And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray you
2KI.4.23	And he said, For what reason will you
2KI.4.24	Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not 
2KI.4.25	So she went and came unto the man of God-Elōhīm 
2KI.4.26	Run now, I pray you
2KI.4.27	And when she came to the man of God-Elōhīm 
2KI.4.28	Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?
2KI.4.29	Then he said to Geichazi 
2KI.4.30	And the mother of the child said, 
2KI.4.31	And Geichazi 
2KI.4.32	And when Eli-sha 
2KI.4.33	He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them both, and prayed unto the 
2KI.4.34	And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child grew warm.
2KI.4.35	Then he went down, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.
2KI.4.36	And he called Geichazi 
2KI.4.37	Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.
2KI.4.38	And Eli-sha 
2KI.4.39	And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred 
2KI.4.40	So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O 
2KI.4.41	But he said, Then bring flour. And he cast 
2KI.4.42	And there came a man from Ba’al-Shalishah 
2KI.4.43	And his servant said, How should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus says the 
2KI.4.44	So he set 
2KI.5.1	Now Na’aman 
2KI.5.2	And the Aram 
2KI.5.3	And she said unto her mistress, Would God-Elōhīm 
2KI.5.4	And 
2KI.5.5	And the king of Aram 
2KI.5.6	And he brought the letter to the king of Yisra’el 
2KI.5.7	And it came to pass, when the king of Yisra’el 
2KI.5.8	And it was 
2KI.5.9	So Na’aman 
2KI.5.10	And Eli-sha 
2KI.5.11	But Na’aman 
2KI.5.13	And his servants came near, and spoke unto him, and said, My father, 
2KI.5.14	Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Yarden 
2KI.5.15	And he returned to the man of God-Elōhīm 
2KI.5.16	But he said, 
2KI.5.17	And Na’aman 
2KI.5.18	In this thing the 
2KI.5.19	And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him after a short distance.
2KI.5.20	But Geichazi 
2KI.5.21	So Geichazi 
2KI.5.22	And he said, All 
2KI.5.23	And Na’aman 
2KI.5.24	And when he came to the tower, he took 
2KI.5.25	But he went in, and stood before his master. And Eli-sha 
2KI.5.26	And he said unto him, Went not my heart [with you
2KI.5.27	The leprosy therefore of Na’aman 
2KI.6.1	And the sons of the prophets said unto Eli-sha 
2KI.6.2	Let us go, we pray you
2KI.6.3	And one said, Be content, I pray you
2KI.6.4	So he went with them. And when they came to Yarden 
2KI.6.5	But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.
2KI.6.6	And the man of God-Elōhīm 
2KI.6.7	Therefore said he, Take 
2KI.6.8	Then the king of Aram 
2KI.6.9	And the man of God-Elōhīm 
2KI.6.10	And the king of Yisra’el 
2KI.6.11	Therefore the heart of the king of Aram 
2KI.6.12	And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Eli-sha 
2KI.6.13	And he said, Go and spy where he 
2KI.6.14	Therefore sent he there horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and surrounded the city about.
2KI.6.15	And when the servant of the man of God-Elōhīm 
2KI.6.16	And he answered, Fear not: for they that 
2KI.6.17	And Eli-sha 
2KI.6.18	And when they came down to him, Eli-sha 
2KI.6.19	And Eli-sha 
2KI.6.20	And it came to pass, when they were come into Shomron 
2KI.6.21	And the king of Yisra’el 
2KI.6.22	And he answered, you
2KI.6.23	And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Aram 
2KI.6.24	And it came to pass after this, that Ben-Hadad [son of the 
2KI.6.25	And there was a great famine in Shomron 
2KI.6.26	And as the king of Yisra’el 
2KI.6.27	And he said, If the 
2KI.6.28	And the king said unto her, What ails you
2KI.6.29	So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give your
2KI.6.30	And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, 
2KI.6.31	Then he said, God-Elōhīm 
2KI.6.32	But Eli-sha 
2KI.6.33	And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil 
2KI.7.1	Then Eli-sha 
2KI.7.2	Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God-Elōhīm 
2KI.7.3	And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?
2KI.7.4	If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine 
2KI.7.5	And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Aram 
2KI.7.6	For the Lord-Adonai 
2KI.7.7	For this reason they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it 
2KI.7.8	And when these lepers came to the outskirts part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried from there silver, and gold, and clothing, and went and hid 
2KI.7.9	Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day 
2KI.7.10	So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Aram 
2KI.7.11	And he called the porters; and they told 
2KI.7.12	And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now show you what the Aram 
2KI.7.13	And one of his servants answered and said, Let 
2KI.7.14	They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Aram 
2KI.7.15	And they went after them unto Yarden 
2KI.7.16	And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Aram 
2KI.7.17	And the king appointed that lord on whose hand he leaned to be in charge of the gate: and the people trampled him down in the gate, and he died, as the man of God-Elōhīm 
2KI.7.18	And it came to pass as the man of God-Elōhīm 
2KI.7.19	And that lord answered the man of God-Elōhīm 
2KI.7.20	And so it fell out unto him: for the people trampled upon him in the gate, and he died.
2KI.8.1	Then spoke Eli-sha 
2KI.8.2	And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God-Elōhīm 
2KI.8.3	And it came to pass at the seven years’ end, that the woman returned out of the land of the P’lishtim 
2KI.8.4	And the king talked with Geichazi 
2KI.8.5	And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Geichazi 
2KI.8.6	And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that 
2KI.8.7	And Eli-sha 
2KI.8.8	And the king said unto Haza’el 
2KI.8.9	So Haza’el 
2KI.8.10	And Eli-sha 
2KI.8.11	And he settled his gaze on the man so long that he

2KI.9.7	And you
2KI.9.8	For the whole house of Ach’av 
2KI.9.9	And I will make the house of Ach’av 
2KI.9.10	And the dogs shall eat Izevel

ISA.1.4	Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the 
ISA.1.5	Why should you
ISA.1.6	From the sole of the foot even unto the head 
ISA.1.7	Your country 
ISA.1.8	And the daughter of Tziyon 
ISA.1.9	Except the

ISA.1.11	To what purpose 
ISA.1.12	When you
ISA.1.13	Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and Shabbat, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; 
ISA.1.14	Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear 
ISA.1.15	And when you
ISA.1.16	Wash you, make yourself clean; put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil;
ISA.1.17	Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, defend the fatherless, plead for the widow.
ISA.1.18	Come now, and let us reason together, says the 
ISA.1.19	If you
ISA.1.20	But if you
ISA.1.21	How is the faithful city become an prostitute! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.
ISA.1.22	Your

ISA.2.1	The word that Yesha’yahu 
ISA.2.2	And it shall come to pass in the last days, 
ISA.2.3	And many people shall go and say, Come you
ISA.2.4	And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke 
ISA.2.5	O house of Ya’akov 
ISA.2.6	Therefore you

ISA.2.8	Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:
ISA.2.9	And the common man bows down, and the great man humbles himself: therefore forgive them not!
ISA.2.10	Enter into the rock, and hide you
ISA.2.11	The proud looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the

ISA.2.21	To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the 
ISA.2.22	Stop relying you
ISA.3.1	For, behold, the Lord-Adon 
ISA.3.2	The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the elder,
ISA.3.3	The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counselor, and the cunning artisan, and the eloquent orator 
ISA.3.4	And I will give children 
ISA.3.5	And the people shall be oppressed, everyone by another, and everyone by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself arrogantly against the elder, and the base against the honourable.
ISA.3.6	When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, 
ISA.3.7	In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house 
ISA.3.8	For Yerushalayim 
ISA.3.9	The show of very faces does witness against them! and they declare their sin as S’dom 
ISA.3.10	Say you
ISA.3.11	Woe unto the wicked! 
ISA.3.13	The 
ISA.3.14	The 
ISA.3.15	What mean you

ISA.3.18	In that day the Lord-Adonai 
ISA.3.19	The chains, and the bracelets, and the veils,
ISA.3.20	The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the amulets, and the earrings,
ISA.3.21	The rings, and nose jewels,
ISA.3.22	The fine dresses, and the mantles, and the shawls, and money purses,
ISA.3.23	The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the veils.
ISA.3.24	And it shall come to pass, 
ISA.3.25	Your
ISA.3.26	And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she 
ISA.4.1	And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by your

ISA.4.3	And it shall come to pass, 
ISA.4.4	When the Lord-Adonai 
ISA.4.5	And the 
ISA.4.6	And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a colonnade from storm and from rain.
ISA.5.1	Now will I sing to my well-beloved a song of my beloved touching His vineyard. My well-beloved has a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:
ISA.5.2	And He fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress in it: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.
ISA.5.3	And now, O inhabitants of Yerushalayim 
ISA.5.4	What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? For what more could be done that, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?
ISA.5.5	And now go forth; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; 
ISA.5.6	And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor excavated; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
ISA.5.7	For the vineyard of the 
ISA.5.8	Woe unto them that join house to house, 
ISA.5.9	In my ears 
ISA.5.10	Yes, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an half a bushel.
ISA.5.11	Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, 
ISA.5.12	And the harp, and the lyre, the tambourine, and flute, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the 
ISA.5.13	Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because 
ISA.5.14	Therefore hell has enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoices, shall descend into it.
ISA.5.15	And the common man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the proud shall be humbled:
ISA.5.16	But the 
ISA.5.17	Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.
ISA.5.18	Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, and sin as it were with a cart rope:
ISA.5.19	That say, Lets him make speed, 
ISA.5.20	Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!
ISA.5.21	Woe unto 
ISA.5.22	Woe unto 
ISA.5.23	Which justify the wicked for bribe, and take away the rights of those who are right! 
ISA.5.24	Therefore as the fire devours the stubble, and the flame consumes the chaff, 
ISA.5.25	Therefore is the anger of the 
ISA.5.26	And he will lift up an flag 
ISA.5.27	None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the belt of their waist be loosed, nor the sandal lace of their shoes be broken:
ISA.5.28	Whose arrows 
ISA.5.29	Their roaring 
ISA.5.30	And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if 
ISA.6.1	In the year that king ‘Uziyah 
ISA.6.2	Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he did fly.
ISA.6.3	And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, 
ISA.6.4	And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
ISA.6.5	Then said I, Woe 
ISA.6.6	Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, 
ISA.6.7	And he laid 
ISA.6.8	Also I heard the Voice of the Lord-Adonai 
ISA.6.9	And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear you
ISA.6.10	Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.
ISA.6.11	Then said I, Lord-Adonai 
ISA.6.12	And the 
ISA.6.13	But yet in it 
ISA.7.1	And it came to pass in the days of Achaz 
ISA.7.2	And it was told the house of David 
ISA.7.3	Then said the 
ISA.7.4	And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Retzin 
ISA.7.5	Because Aram 
ISA.7.6	Let us go up against Y’hudah 
ISA.7.7	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
ISA.7.8	For the head of Aram 
ISA.7.9	And the head of Efrayim 
ISA.7.10	Moreover the 
ISA.7.11	Ask you
ISA.7.12	But Achaz 
ISA.7.13	And he said, Hear you
ISA.7.14	Therefore the Lord-Adonai 
ISA.7.15	Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.
ISA.7.16	For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that you

ISA.7.19	And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.
ISA.7.20	In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, 
ISA.7.21	And it shall come to pass in that day, 
ISA.7.22	And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk 
ISA.7.23	And it shall come to pass in that day, 
ISA.7.24	With arrows and with bows shall 
ISA.7.25	And 
ISA.8.1	Moreover the 
ISA.8.2	And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriyah 
ISA.8.3	And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bore a son. Then said the 
ISA.8.4	For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Dammesek 
ISA.8.5	The 
ISA.8.6	Forasmuch as this people refuses the waters of Shilo’ach 
ISA.8.7	Now therefore, behold, the Lord-Adonai 
ISA.8.8	And he shall pass through Y’hudah

ISA.8.15	And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.
ISA.8.16	Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.

ISA.8.21	And they shall pass through the land, hardly served and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall be troubled 
ISA.8.22	And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and

ISA.13.10	For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.
ISA.13.11	And I will punish the world for 
ISA.13.12	I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ofir 
ISA.13.13	Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the 
ISA.13.14	And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man takes up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee everyone into his own land.
ISA.13.15	Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and everyone that is joined 
ISA.13.16	Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives raped.
ISA.13.17	Behold, I will stir up the Medes 
ISA.13.19	And Bavel 
ISA.13.20	It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Aravi 
ISA.13.21	But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful 
ISA.13.22	And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in 
ISA.14.1	For the 
ISA.14.2	And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and the house of Yisra’el 
ISA.14.3	And it shall come to pass in the day that the 
ISA.14.4	That you
ISA.14.5	The 
ISA.14.6	He who struck the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, 
ISA.14.7	The whole earth is at rest, 
ISA.14.8	Yes, the fir trees rejoice at you
ISA.14.9	Hell from beneath is moved for you
ISA.14.10	All they shall speak and say unto you
ISA.14.11	Your
ISA.14.12	How are you
ISA.14.13	For you
ISA.14.14	I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High.
ISA.14.15	Yet you
ISA.14.16	They that see you
ISA.14.18	All the kings of the nations, 
ISA.14.19	But you
ISA.14.20	you
ISA.14.21	Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.
ISA.14.22	For I will rise up against them, says the 
ISA.14.23	I will also make it a possession for the hedgehogs, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the broom of destruction, says the 
ISA.14.24	The 
ISA.14.25	That I will break the Ashur 
ISA.14.26	This 
ISA.14.27	For the 
ISA.14.28	In the year that king Achaz 
ISA.14.29	Rejoice not you
ISA.14.30	And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill your
ISA.14.31	Howl, O gate; cry, O city; you
ISA.14.32	What shall 
ISA.15.1	The burden of Mo’av 
ISA.15.2	He is gone up to Bayit 
ISA.15.3	In their streets they shall clothe themselves with sackcloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, everyone shall howl, weeping abundantly.
ISA.15.4	And Heshbon 
ISA.15.5	My heart shall cry out for Mo’av 
ISA.15.6	For the waters of Nimrim 
ISA.15.7	Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows.
ISA.15.8	For the cry is gone round about the borders of Mo’av 
ISA.15.9	For the waters of Dimon 
ISA.16.1	Send you
ISA.16.2	For it shall be, 
ISA.16.3	Take counsel, execute judgment; make your
ISA.16.4	Let my outcasts dwell with you
ISA.16.5	And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in tin the tabernacle of David 
ISA.16.6	We have heard of the pride of Mo’av 
ISA.16.7	Therefore shall Mo’av 
ISA.16.8	For the fields of Heshbon 
ISA.16.9	Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Ya’zer 
ISA.16.10	And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall trample out no wine in 
ISA.16.11	For what reason my bowels 
ISA.16.12	And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Mo’av 
ISA.16.13	This 
ISA.16.14	But now the 
ISA.17.1	The burden of Dammesek 
ISA.17.2	The cities of ‘Aeo’er 
ISA.17.3	The fortress also shall cease from Efrayim 
ISA.17.4	And in that day it shall come to pass, 
ISA.17.5	And it shall be as when the harvestman gathers the corn, and reaps the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that gathers ears in the valley of Refa’im 
ISA.17.6	Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive tree, two 
ISA.17.7	At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Yisra’el 
ISA.17.8	And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, neither shall respect 
ISA.17.9	In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough, and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the people of Yisra’el 
ISA.17.10	Because you
ISA.17.11	In the day shall you
ISA.17.12	Woe to the multitude of many people, 
ISA.17.13	The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but [God-Elōhīm 
ISA.17.14	And behold at evening trouble; 
ISA.18.1	Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which 
ISA.18.2	That send ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes 
ISA.18.3	All you
ISA.18.4	For so the 
ISA.18.5	For before the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away 
ISA.18.6	They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.
ISA.18.7	In that time shall the present be brought unto the 
ISA.19.1	The burden of Mitzrayim 
ISA.19.2	And I will set the Mitzri against the Mitzri: and they shall fight everyone against his brother, and everyone against his neighbour; city against city, 
ISA.19.3	And the spirit of Mitzrayim 
ISA.19.4	And the Mitzri will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, says the Lord-Adon 
ISA.19.5	And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be parched and dried up.
ISA.19.6	And they shall turn the rivers far away; 
ISA.19.7	The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and everything sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no 
ISA.19.8	The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle 
ISA.19.9	Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave networks, shall be confounded.
ISA.19.10	And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make sluices 
ISA.19.11	Surely the princes of Tzo’an 
ISA.19.12	Where 
ISA.19.13	The princes of Tzo’an 
ISA.19.14	The 
ISA.19.15	Neither shall there be 
ISA.19.16	In that day shall Mitzrayim 
ISA.19.17	And the land of Y’hudah 
ISA.19.18	In that day shall five cities in the land of Mitzrayim 
ISA.19.19	In that day shall there be an altar to the 
ISA.19.20	And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the 
ISA.19.21	And the 
ISA.19.22	And the 
ISA.19.23	In that day shall there be a highway out of Mitzrayim 
ISA.19.24	In that day shall Yisra’el 
ISA.19.25	Whom the 
ISA.20.1	In the year that Tartan 
ISA.20.2	At the same time spoke the 
ISA.20.3	And the 
ISA.20.4	So shall the king of Ashur 
ISA.20.5	And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia 
ISA.20.6	And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold, such 
ISA.21.1	The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; 
ISA.21.2	A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer deals treacherously, and the spoiler spoils. Go up, O ‘Eilam 
ISA.21.3	Therefore are my waist filled with pain: pangs 
ISA.21.4	My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure has he turned into fear unto me.
ISA.21.5	Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, you
ISA.21.6	For thus has the Lord-Adonai 
ISA.21.7	And he saw a chariot 
ISA.21.8	And he cried, A lion: My lord-Adonai 
ISA.21.9	And, behold, here comes a chariot of men, 
ISA.21.10	O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the 
ISA.21.11	The burden of Dumah 
ISA.21.12	The watchman said, The morning comes, and also the night: if you
ISA.21.13	The burden upon Arabia 
ISA.21.14	The inhabitants of the land of Teima 
ISA.21.15	For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.
ISA.21.16	For thus has the Lord-Adonai 
ISA.21.17	And the residue 
ISA.22.1	The burden of the Valley of Vision. What ails you
ISA.22.2	You
ISA.22.3	All your
ISA.22.4	Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labour not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people.
ISA.22.5	For 
ISA.22.6	And ‘Eilam 
ISA.22.7	And it shall come to pass, 
ISA.22.8	And he removed the protection of Y’hudah 
ISA.22.9	You
ISA.22.10	And you
ISA.22.11	You
ISA.22.12	And in that day did the Lord-Adonai 
ISA.22.13	And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we shall die.
ISA.22.14	And it was revealed in my ears by the 
ISA.22.15	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
ISA.22.16	What have you
ISA.22.17	Behold, the 
ISA.22.18	He will surely violently turn and toss you
ISA.22.19	And I will drive you
ISA.22.20	And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Elyakim 
ISA.22.21	And I will clothe him with your
ISA.22.22	And the key of the house of David 
ISA.22.23	And I will fasten him 
ISA.22.24	And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father’s house, the offspring and the issue 
ISA.22.25	In that day, says the 
ISA.23.1	The burden of Tzor 
ISA.23.2	Be still, you
ISA.23.3	And by great waters the seed of Shichor 
ISA.23.4	Be you
ISA.23.5	As at the report concerning Mitzrayim 
ISA.23.6	Pass you
ISA.23.8	Who has taken this counsel against Tzor 
ISA.23.9	The 
ISA.23.10	Pass through your
ISA.23.11	He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms: the 
ISA.23.12	And he said, you
ISA.23.13	Behold the land of the Kasdim 
ISA.23.14	Howl, you
ISA.23.15	And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tzor 
ISA.23.16	Take an harp, go about the city, you
ISA.23.17	And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the 
ISA.23.18	And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the 
ISA.24.1	Behold, the 
ISA.24.2	And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury 
ISA.24.3	The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the 
ISA.24.4	The earth mourns 
ISA.24.5	The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.
ISA.24.6	Therefore has the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell in it are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.
ISA.24.7	The New Wine mourns, the vine languishes, all the merry hearted do sigh.
ISA.24.8	The gladness of tambourines ceases, the noise of them that rejoice ends, the joy of the harp ceases.
ISA.24.9	They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.
ISA.24.10	The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that no man may come in.
ISA.24.12	In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction.
ISA.24.13	When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, 
ISA.24.14	They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the 
ISA.24.15	For what reason glorify you
ISA.24.16	From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, 
ISA.24.17	Fear, and the pit, and the snare, 
ISA.24.18	And it shall come to pass, 
ISA.24.19	The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.
ISA.24.20	The earth shall reel 
ISA.24.21	And it shall come to pass in that day, 
ISA.24.22	And they shall be gathered together, 
ISA.24.23	Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the 
ISA.25.1	O 
ISA.25.2	For you
ISA.25.3	Therefore shall the strong people glorify you
ISA.25.4	For you
ISA.25.5	you
ISA.25.6	And in this mountain shall the 
ISA.25.7	And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the veil that is spread over all nations.
ISA.25.8	He will swallow 
ISA.25.9	And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this 
ISA.25.10	For in this mountain shall the hand of the 
ISA.25.11	And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swims spreads forth 
ISA.25.12	And the fortress of the high fort of your
ISA.26.1	In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Y’hudah 
ISA.26.2	Open you
ISA.26.3	you
ISA.26.4	Trust you
ISA.26.5	For he brings down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he lays it low; he lays it low, 
ISA.26.6	The foot shall trample it down, 
ISA.26.7	The way of the just 
ISA.26.8	Yes, in the way of your
ISA.26.9	With my soul have I desired you
ISA.26.10	Let favour be showed to the wicked, 
ISA.26.11	-Yehōvah 
ISA.26.12	-Yehōvah 
ISA.26.13	O 
ISA.26.15	you
ISA.26.16	-Yehōvah 
ISA.26.17	Like as a woman with child, 
ISA.26.18	We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were have given birth to wind; we have not brought any salvation in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world born.
ISA.26.19	Your
ISA.26.20	Come, my people, enter you
ISA.26.21	For, behold, the 
ISA.27.1	In that day the 
ISA.27.2	In that day sing you
ISA.27.3	I the 
ISA.27.4	Fury 
ISA.27.5	Or let him take hold of my strength, 
ISA.27.6	He shall cause them that come of Ya’akov 
ISA.27.7	Has he smitten him, as he struck those that struck him? 
ISA.27.8	In measure, when it shoots forth, you
ISA.27.9	By this therefore shall the iniquity of Ya’akov 
ISA.27.10	Yet the fortified city 
ISA.27.11	When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off: the women come, 
ISA.27.12	And it shall come to pass in that day, 
ISA.27.13	And it shall come to pass in that day, 
ISA.28.1	Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Efrayim 
ISA.28.2	Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one, 
ISA.28.3	The crown of pride, the drunkards of Efrayim 
ISA.28.4	And the glorious beauty, which 
ISA.28.5	In that day shall the 
ISA.28.6	And for a spirit of judgment to him that sits in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.
ISA.28.7	But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallow (to approve, commend, accept)ed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble 
ISA.28.8	For all tables are full of vomit 
ISA.28.9	Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? 
ISA.28.10	For precept 
ISA.28.11	For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.
ISA.28.12	To whom he said, This 
ISA.28.13	But the word of the 
ISA.28.14	For this reason hear the word of the 
ISA.28.15	Because you
ISA.28.16	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
ISA.28.17	Justice also will I lay as the plumbline, and righteousness to the level: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.
ISA.28.18	And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then you
ISA.28.19	From the time that it goes forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a anguish only 
ISA.28.20	For the bed is shorter than that 
ISA.28.21	For the 
ISA.28.22	Now therefore be you
ISA.28.23	Give you
ISA.28.24	Does the plowman plow all day to sow? does he open and break the clods of his ground?
ISA.28.25	When he has made plain the face thereof, does he not cast abroad the fitches 
ISA.28.26	For his God-Elōhīm 
ISA.28.27	For the fitches 
ISA.28.28	Bread 
ISA.28.29	This also comes forth from the 
ISA.29.1	Woe to Ari’el 
ISA.29.2	Yet I will distress Ari’el 
ISA.29.3	And I will camp against you
ISA.29.4	And you
ISA.29.5	Moreover the multitude of your
ISA.29.6	You
ISA.29.7	And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ari’el 
ISA.29.8	It shall even be as when an hungry 
ISA.29.9	Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry you
ISA.29.10	For the 
ISA.29.11	And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which 
ISA.29.12	And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray you
ISA.29.13	For what reason the Lord-Adonai 
ISA.29.14	Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, 
ISA.29.15	Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the 
ISA.29.16	Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter’s clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?
ISA.29.18	And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.
ISA.29.19	The meek also shall increase 
ISA.29.20	For the terrible one is brought to nothing, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:
ISA.29.21	That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproves in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nothing.
ISA.29.22	Therefore thus says the 
ISA.29.23	But when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify 
ISA.29.24	They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.
ISA.30.1	Woe to the rebellious children, says the 
ISA.30.2	That walk to go down into Mitzrayim 
ISA.30.3	Therefore shall the strength of Par’oh 
ISA.30.4	For his princes were at Tzo’an 
ISA.30.5	They were all ashamed of a people 
ISA.30.6	The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from what place 
ISA.30.7	For the Mitzri shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength 
ISA.30.8	Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come forever and ever:
ISA.30.9	That this 
ISA.30.10	Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits:
ISA.30.11	Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Yisra’el 
ISA.30.12	For what reason thus says the Holy One of Yisra’el 
ISA.30.13	Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach 
ISA.30.14	And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters’ vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a shard to take fire from the hearth, or to take water 
ISA.30.15	For thus says the Lord-Adonai 
ISA.30.16	But you
ISA.30.17	One thousand 
ISA.30.18	And therefore will the 
ISA.30.19	For the people shall dwell in Tziyon 
ISA.30.20	And 
ISA.30.21	And your
ISA.30.22	You
ISA.30.23	Then shall he give the rain of you
ISA.30.24	The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender 
ISA.30.25	And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers 
ISA.30.26	Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the 
ISA.30.27	Behold, the name of the 
ISA.30.28	And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and 
ISA.30.29	You
ISA.30.30	And the 
ISA.30.31	For through the Voice of the 
ISA.30.32	And 
ISA.30.33	For Tofet 
ISA.31.1	Woe to them that go down to Mitzrayim 
ISA.31.2	Yet he also 
ISA.31.3	Now the Mitzri 
ISA.31.4	For thus has the 
ISA.31.5	As birds flying, so will the 
ISA.31.6	Turn you
ISA.31.7	For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you 
ISA.31.8	Then shall the Ashur 
ISA.31.9	And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the flag 
ISA.32.1	Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.
ISA.32.2	And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a colonnade from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.
ISA.32.3	And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken.
ISA.32.4	The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.
ISA.32.5	The vile person shall be no more called generous, nor the rude 
ISA.32.6	For the vile person will speak villainy, and his heart will work iniquity, to practice hypocrisy, and to utter error against the 
ISA.32.7	The instruments also of the rude 
ISA.32.8	But the generous devises generous things; and by generous things shall he stand.
ISA.32.9	Rise up, you
ISA.32.10	Many days and years shall you
ISA.32.11	Tremble, you
ISA.32.12	Beat your breasts, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.
ISA.32.13	Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns 
ISA.32.14	Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens forever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;
ISA.32.15	Until the Spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.
ISA.32.16	Then justice shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field.
ISA.32.17	And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance forever.
ISA.32.18	And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places;
ISA.32.19	When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city shall be low in a low place.
ISA.32.20	Blessed 
ISA.33.1	Woe to you
ISA.33.2	O 
ISA.33.3	At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of yourself the nations were scattered.
ISA.33.4	And your spoil 
ISA.33.5	The 
ISA.33.6	And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of your
ISA.33.7	Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.
ISA.33.8	The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceases: he has broken the covenant, he has despised the cities, he regards no man.
ISA.33.9	The earth mourns 
ISA.33.10	Now will I rise, says the 
ISA.33.11	You
ISA.33.12	And the people shall be 
ISA.33.13	Hear, you
ISA.33.14	The sinners in Tziyon 
ISA.33.15	He that walks righteously, and speaks uprightly; he that despises the gain of oppressions, that shakes his hands from holding of bribes, that stops his ears from hearing of blood, and shuts his eyes from seeing evil;
ISA.33.16	He shall dwell on high: his place of defense 
ISA.33.17	Your
ISA.33.18	Your
ISA.33.19	you
ISA.33.20	Look upon Tziyon 
ISA.33.21	But there the glorious 
ISA.33.22	For the 
ISA.33.23	Your
ISA.33.24	And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell in it 
ISA.34.1	Come near, you
ISA.34.2	For the indignation of the 
ISA.34.3	Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of their carcasses, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.
ISA.34.4	And all the army of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falls off from the vine, and as a falling 
ISA.34.5	For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Edom 
ISA.34.6	The sword of the 
ISA.34.7	And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.
ISA.34.8	For 
ISA.34.9	And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into sulfur, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.
ISA.34.10	It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up forever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it forever and ever.
ISA.34.11	But the cormorant and the hedgehogs shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.
ISA.34.12	They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none 
ISA.34.13	And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, 
ISA.34.14	The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the he-goat shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.
ISA.34.15	There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, everyone with her mate.
ISA.34.16	Seek you
ISA.34.17	And he has cast the lot for them, and his hand has divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it forever, from generation to generation shall they dwell in it.
ISA.35.1	The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.
ISA.35.2	It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of L’vanon 
ISA.35.3	Strengthen you
ISA.35.4	Say to them 
ISA.35.5	Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
ISA.35.6	Then shall the lame 
ISA.35.7	And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, 
ISA.35.8	And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it 
ISA.35.9	No lion shall be there, nor 
ISA.35.10	And the ransomed of the 
ISA.36.1	Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hizkiyahu 
ISA.36.2	And the king of Ashur 
ISA.36.3	Then came forth unto him Elyakim 
ISA.36.4	And Rav-Shakeh 
ISA.36.5	I say, 
ISA.36.6	Lo, you
ISA.36.7	But if you
ISA.36.8	Now therefore give pledges, I pray you
ISA.36.9	How then will you
ISA.36.10	And am I now come up without the 
ISA.36.11	Then said Elyakim 
ISA.36.12	But Rav-Shakeh 
ISA.36.13	Then Rav-Shakeh 
ISA.36.14	Thus says the king, Let not Hizkiyahu 
ISA.36.15	Neither let Hizkiyahu 
ISA.36.16	Listen not to Hizkiyahu 
ISA.36.17	Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
ISA.36.19	Where 
ISA.36.20	Who 
ISA.36.21	But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
ISA.36.22	Then came Elyakim 
ISA.37.1	And it came to pass, when king Hizkiyahu 
ISA.37.2	And he sent Elyakim 
ISA.37.3	And they said unto him, Thus says Hizkiyahu 
ISA.37.4	It may be the 
ISA.37.5	So the servants of king Hizkiyahu 
ISA.37.6	And Yesha’yahu 
ISA.37.7	Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
ISA.37.8	So Rav-Shakeh 
ISA.37.9	And he heard say concerning Tirhakah 
ISA.37.10	Thus shall you
ISA.37.11	Behold, you
ISA.37.12	Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, 
ISA.37.13	Where 
ISA.37.14	And Hizkiyahu 
ISA.37.15	And Hizkiyahu 
ISA.37.16	O 
ISA.37.17	Incline you
ISA.37.18	Of a truth, 
ISA.37.19	And have cast their gods into the fire: for they 
ISA.37.20	Now therefore, O 
ISA.37.21	Then Yesha’yahu 
ISA.37.22	This 
ISA.37.23	Whom have you
ISA.37.24	By your
ISA.37.25	I have excavated, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.
ISA.37.26	Have you
ISA.37.27	Therefore their inhabitants 
ISA.37.28	But I know you
ISA.37.29	Because your
ISA.37.30	And this 
ISA.37.31	And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Y’hudah 
ISA.37.32	For out of Yerushalayim 
ISA.37.33	Therefore thus says the 
ISA.37.34	By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, says the 
ISA.37.35	For I will defend this city to save it for my own sake, and for my servant David’s 
ISA.37.36	Then the Angel of the 
ISA.37.37	So Sancheriv [Sin 
ISA.37.38	And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisrokh 
ISA.38.1	In those days was Hizkiyahu 
ISA.38.2	Then Hizkiyahu 
ISA.38.3	And said, Remember now, O 
ISA.38.4	Then came the word of the 
ISA.38.5	Go, and say to Hizkiyahu 
ISA.38.6	And I will deliver you
ISA.38.7	And this 
ISA.38.8	Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Achaz 
ISA.38.9	The writing of Hizkiyahu 
ISA.38.10	I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue 
ISA.38.11	I said, I shall not see the 
ISA.38.12	Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd’s tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day 
ISA.38.13	I reckoned till morning, 
ISA.38.14	Like a crane 
ISA.38.15	What shall I say? he has both spoken unto me, and himself has done 
ISA.38.16	O Lord-Adonai 
ISA.38.17	Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but you
ISA.38.18	For the grave cannot praise you
ISA.38.19	The living, the living, he shall praise you
ISA.38.20	The 
ISA.38.21	For Yesha’yahu 
ISA.38.22	Hizkiyahu 
ISA.39.1	At that time M’rodakh-Bal’adan 
ISA.39.2	And Hizkiyahu 
ISA.39.3	Then came Yesha’yahu 
ISA.39.4	Then said he, What have they seen in your
ISA.39.5	Then said Yesha’yahu 
ISA.39.6	Behold, the days come, that all that 
ISA.39.7	And of your
ISA.39.8	Then said Hizkiyahu 
ISA.40.1	Comfort you
ISA.40.2	Speak you
ISA.40.3	The voice of him that cries in the wilderness, Prepare you
ISA.40.4	Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain:
ISA.40.5	And the glory of the 
ISA.40.6	The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh 
ISA.40.7	The grass withers, the flower fades: because the spirit of the 
ISA.40.8	The grass withers, the flower fades: but the word of our God-Elōhīm 
ISA.40.9	O Tziyon 
ISA.40.10	Behold, the Lord-Adonai 
ISA.40.11	He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry 
ISA.40.12	Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?
ISA.40.13	Who has directed the Spirit of the 
ISA.40.14	With whom took he counsel, and 
ISA.40.15	Behold, the nations 
ISA.40.16	And L’vanon 
ISA.40.17	All nations before him 
ISA.40.18	To whom then will you
ISA.40.19	The workman melts a graven image, and the goldsmith spreads it over with gold, and casts silver chains.
ISA.40.20	He that 
ISA.40.21	Have you
ISA.40.23	That brings the princes to nothing; he makes the of the earth as vanity.
ISA.40.24	Yes, they shall not be planted; yes, they shall not be sown: yes, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.
ISA.40.25	To whom then will you
ISA.40.26	Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who has created these 
ISA.40.27	Why say you
ISA.40.28	Have you
ISA.40.29	He gives power to the faint; and to 
ISA.40.30	Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:
ISA.40.31	But they that wait upon the 
ISA.41.1	Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew 
ISA.41.2	Who raised up the righteous 
ISA.41.3	He pursued them, 
ISA.41.4	Who has wrought and done 
ISA.41.5	The isles saw 
ISA.41.6	They helped everyone his neighbour; and 
ISA.41.7	So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, 
ISA.41.8	But you
ISA.41.10	Fear you
ISA.41.11	Behold, all they that were incensed against you
ISA.41.12	you
ISA.41.13	For I the 
ISA.41.14	Fear not, you
ISA.41.15	Behold, I will make you
ISA.41.16	You
ISA.41.18	I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.
ISA.41.19	I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, 
ISA.41.20	That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the 
ISA.41.21	Produce your cause, says the 
ISA.41.22	Let them bring 
ISA.41.23	Show the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that you
ISA.41.24	Behold, you
ISA.41.25	I have raised up 
ISA.41.26	Who has declared from the beginning, that we may know? and formerly, that we may say, 
ISA.41.27	The first 
ISA.41.28	For I beheld, and 
ISA.41.29	Behold, they 
ISA.42.1	Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, 
ISA.42.2	He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.
ISA.42.3	A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.
ISA.42.4	He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set justice in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.
ISA.42.5	Thus says God-Elōhīm 
ISA.42.6	I the 
ISA.42.7	To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, 
ISA.42.8	I 
ISA.42.9	Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.
ISA.42.10	Sing unto the 
ISA.42.11	Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up 
ISA.42.12	Let them give glory unto the 
ISA.42.13	The 
ISA.42.14	I have long time held my peace; I have been still, 
ISA.42.15	I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.
ISA.42.16	And I will bring the blind by a way 
ISA.42.17	They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, You
ISA.42.18	Hear, you
ISA.42.19	Who 
ISA.42.20	Seeing manythings, but you
ISA.42.21	The 
ISA.42.22	But this 
ISA.42.23	Who among you will give ear to this? 
ISA.42.24	Who gave Ya’akov 
ISA.42.25	Therefore he has poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it has set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid 
ISA.43.1	But now thus says the 
ISA.43.2	When you
ISA.43.3	For I 
ISA.43.4	Since you
ISA.43.5	Fear not: for I 
ISA.43.6	I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;
ISA.43.8	Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.
ISA.43.9	Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and show us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, 
ISA.43.10	You
ISA.43.11	I, 
ISA.43.12	I have declared, and have saved, and I have showed, when 
ISA.43.13	Yes, before the day 
ISA.43.14	Thus says the 
ISA.43.15	I 
ISA.43.16	Thus says the 
ISA.43.17	Which brings forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tinder.
ISA.43.18	Remember you
ISA.43.19	Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall you
ISA.43.20	The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, 
ISA.43.21	This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise.
ISA.43.22	But you
ISA.43.23	you
ISA.43.24	you
ISA.43.25	I, 
ISA.43.26	Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare you
ISA.43.27	Your
ISA.43.28	Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Ya’akov 
ISA.44.1	Yet now hear, O Ya’akov 
ISA.44.2	Thus says the 
ISA.44.3	For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon you
ISA.44.4	And they shall spring up 
ISA.44.5	One shall say, I 
ISA.44.6	Thus says the 
ISA.44.7	And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them show unto them.
ISA.44.8	Fear you
ISA.44.9	They that make a graven image 
ISA.44.10	Who has formed a god, or molten a graven image 
ISA.44.11	Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they 
ISA.44.12	The smith with the tongs both works in the coals, and fashions it with hammers, and works it with the strength of his arms: yes, he is hungry, and his strength fails: he drink no water, and is faint.
ISA.44.13	The carpenter stretches out 
ISA.44.14	He hews him down cedars, and takes the cypress and the oak, which he strengthens for himself among the trees of the forest: he plants an ash, and the rain does nourish 
ISA.44.15	Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yes, he kindles 
ISA.44.16	He burns part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eats flesh; he roasts roast, and is satisfied: yes, he warms 
ISA.44.17	And the residue 
ISA.44.18	They have not known nor understood: for he has shut their eyes, that they cannot see; 
ISA.44.19	And none considers in his heart, neither 
ISA.44.20	He feeds on ashes: a deceived heart has turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, 
ISA.44.21	Remember these, O Ya’akov 
ISA.44.22	I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your
ISA.44.23	Sing, O you
ISA.44.24	Thus says the 
ISA.44.25	That frustrates the tokens of the liars, and makes diviners mad; that turns wise 
ISA.44.26	That confirms the word of his servant, and performs the counsel of his messengers; that says to Yerushalayim 
ISA.44.27	That says to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up your
ISA.44.28	That says of Koresh 
ISA.45.1	Thus says the 
ISA.45.2	I will go before you
ISA.45.3	And I will give you
ISA.45.4	For Ya’akov 
ISA.45.5	I 
ISA.45.6	That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that 
ISA.45.7	I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the 
ISA.45.8	Drop down, you
ISA.45.9	Woe unto him that strives with his Maker! 
ISA.45.10	Woe unto him that says unto 
ISA.45.11	Thus says the 
ISA.45.12	I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, 
ISA.45.13	I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, says the 
ISA.45.14	Thus says the 
ISA.45.15	Truly you
ISA.45.16	They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they shall go to confusion together 
ISA.45.18	For thus says the 
ISA.45.19	I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said not unto the seed of Ya’akov 
ISA.45.20	Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, you
ISA.45.21	Tell you
ISA.45.22	Look unto me, and be you
ISA.45.23	I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth 
ISA.45.24	Surely, shall 
ISA.45.25	In the 
ISA.46.1	Bel 
ISA.46.2	They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.
ISA.46.3	Listen unto me, O house of Ya’akov 
ISA.46.4	And 
ISA.46.5	To whom will you
ISA.46.6	They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, 
ISA.46.7	They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he stands; from his place shall he not remove: yes, 
ISA.46.8	Remember this, and show yourselves men: bring 
ISA.46.9	Remember the former things of old: for I 
ISA.46.10	Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times 
ISA.46.11	Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executes my counsel from a far country: yes, I have spoken 
ISA.46.12	Listen unto me, you
ISA.46.13	I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not wait: and I will place salvation in Tziyon 
ISA.47.1	Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Bavel 
ISA.47.2	Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover your
ISA.47.3	You
ISA.47.5	Sit you
ISA.47.6	I was exceedingly angry with my people, I have polluted my inheritance, and given them into your
ISA.47.7	And you
ISA.47.8	Therefore hear now this, 
ISA.47.9	But these two 
ISA.47.10	For you
ISA.47.11	Therefore shall evil come upon you
ISA.47.12	Stand now with your
ISA.47.13	you
ISA.47.14	Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: 
ISA.47.15	Thus shall they be unto you
ISA.48.1	Hear you
ISA.48.2	For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God-Elōhīm 
ISA.48.3	I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them; I did 
ISA.48.4	Because I knew that you
ISA.48.5	I have even from the beginning declared 
ISA.48.6	You
ISA.48.7	They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when you
ISA.48.8	Yes, you
ISA.48.9	For my name’s sake will I defer my anger, and for my praise will I refrain for you
ISA.48.10	Behold, I have refined you
ISA.48.11	For my own sake, 
ISA.48.12	Listen unto me, O Ya’akov 
ISA.48.13	Mine hand also has laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand has spanned the heavens: 
ISA.48.14	All you
ISA.48.15	I, 
ISA.48.16	Come you
ISA.48.17	Thus says the 
ISA.48.18	O that you
ISA.48.19	You
ISA.48.20	Go you
ISA.48.21	And they thirsted not 
ISA.49.1	Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, you
ISA.49.2	And he has made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand has he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver has he hid me;
ISA.49.3	And said unto me, you
ISA.49.4	Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing, and in vain: 
ISA.49.5	And now, says the 
ISA.49.6	And he said, It is a light thing that you
ISA.49.7	Thus says the 
ISA.49.8	Thus says the 
ISA.49.9	That you
ISA.49.10	They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun strike them: for he that has mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.
ISA.49.11	And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.
ISA.49.12	Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim 
ISA.49.13	Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the 
ISA.49.14	But Tziyon 
ISA.49.15	Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yes, they may forget, yet will I not forget you
ISA.49.16	Behold, I have graven you
ISA.49.17	Your
ISA.49.18	Lift up your
ISA.49.19	For your
ISA.49.20	The children which you
ISA.49.21	Then shall you
ISA.49.22	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
ISA.49.23	And kings shall be your
ISA.49.24	Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?
ISA.49.25	But thus says the 
ISA.49.26	And I will feed them that oppress you
ISA.50.1	Thus says the 
ISA.50.2	For what reason, when I came, 
ISA.50.3	I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.
ISA.50.4	The Lord-Adonai 
ISA.50.5	The Lord-Adonai 
ISA.50.6	I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.
ISA.50.7	For the Lord-Adonai 
ISA.50.9	Behold, the Lord-Adonai 
ISA.50.10	Who 
ISA.50.11	Behold, all you
ISA.51.1	Listen to me, you
ISA.51.2	Look unto Avraham 
ISA.51.3	For the 
ISA.51.4	Listen unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a Torah shall proceed from me, and I will calm them with my justice for a light of the people.
ISA.51.5	My righteousness 
ISA.51.6	Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall grow 
ISA.51.7	Listen unto me, you
ISA.51.8	For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be forever, and my salvation from generation to generation.
ISA.51.9	Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the 
ISA.51.11	Therefore the redeemed of the 
ISA.51.12	I, 
ISA.51.13	And forgets the 
ISA.51.14	The captive exile hastens that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.
ISA.51.15	But I 
ISA.51.16	And I have put my words in your
ISA.51.17	Awake, awake, stand up, O Yerushalayim 
ISA.51.19	These two 
ISA.51.20	Your
ISA.51.21	Therefore hear now this, you
ISA.51.22	Thus says your
ISA.51.23	But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict you
ISA.52.1	Awake, awake; put on your
ISA.52.2	Shake yourself from the dust; arise, 
ISA.52.3	For thus says the 
ISA.52.4	For thus says the Lord-Adonai 
ISA.52.5	Now therefore, what have I here, says the 
ISA.52.6	Therefore my people shall know my Name: therefore 
ISA.52.7	How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that brings good tidings, that proclaims peace; that brings good tidings of good, that proclaims Salvation; that says unto Tziyon 
ISA.52.8	Your
ISA.52.9	Break forth into joy, sing together, you
ISA.52.10	The 
ISA.52.11	Depart you
ISA.52.12	For you
ISA.52.13	Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.
ISA.52.14	Just as many were astonished at you
ISA.52.15	So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for 
ISA.53.1	Who has believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the 
ISA.53.2	For he shall grow up before Him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he has no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, 
ISA.53.3	He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were 
ISA.53.4	Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God-Elōhīm 
ISA.53.5	But he 
ISA.53.6	All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned everyone to his own way; and the 
ISA.53.7	He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is silent, so he opens not his mouth.
ISA.53.8	He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.
ISA.53.9	And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither 
ISA.53.10	Yet it pleased the 
ISA.53.11	He shall see of the travail of his soul, 
ISA.53.12	Therefore will I divide him 
ISA.54.1	Sing, O barren, you
ISA.54.2	Enlarge the place of your
ISA.54.3	For you
ISA.54.4	Fear not; for you
ISA.54.5	For your
ISA.54.6	For the 
ISA.54.7	For a small moment have I forsaken you
ISA.54.8	In a little wrath I hid my face from you
ISA.54.9	For this 
ISA.54.10	For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from you
ISA.54.11	O you
ISA.54.12	And I will make your
ISA.54.13	And all your
ISA.54.14	In righteousness shall you
ISA.54.15	Behold, they shall surely gather together, 
ISA.54.16	Behold, I have created the smith that blows the coals in the fire, and that brings forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.
ISA.54.17	No weapon that is formed against you
ISA.55.1	Ho, everyone that thirsts, come you
ISA.55.2	For what reason do you
ISA.55.3	Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, 
ISA.55.4	Behold, I have given him 
ISA.55.5	Behold, you
ISA.55.6	Seek you
ISA.55.7	Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the 
ISA.55.8	For my thoughts 
ISA.55.9	For 
ISA.55.10	For as the rain comes down, and the snow from heaven, and returns not there, but waters the earth, and makes it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:
ISA.55.11	So shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper 
ISA.55.12	For you
ISA.55.13	Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the 
ISA.56.1	Thus says the 
ISA.56.2	Blessed 
ISA.56.3	Neither let the son of the stranger, that has joined himself to the 
ISA.56.4	For thus says the 
ISA.56.5	Even unto them will I give in my house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.
ISA.56.6	Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the 
ISA.56.7	Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices 
ISA.56.8	The Lord-Adonai 
ISA.56.9	All you
ISA.56.10	His watchmen 
ISA.56.11	Yes, 
ISA.56.12	Come you
ISA.57.1	The righteous perishes, and no man lays 
ISA.57.2	He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, 
ISA.57.3	But draw near here, you
ISA.57.4	Against whom do you
ISA.57.5	Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks?
ISA.57.6	Among the smooth 
ISA.57.7	Upon a lofty and high mountain have you
ISA.57.8	Behind the doors also and the posts have you
ISA.57.9	And you
ISA.57.10	you
ISA.57.11	And of whom have you
ISA.57.12	I will declare your
ISA.57.13	When you
ISA.57.14	And shall say, Cast you
ISA.57.15	For thus says the high and lofty One that inhabits eternity, whose name 
ISA.57.16	For I will not contend forever, neither will I be always exceedingly angry: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls 
ISA.57.17	For the iniquity of his covetousness was I exceedingly angry, and struck him: I hid me, and was exceedingly angry, and he went on obstinately in the way of his heart.
ISA.57.18	I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.
ISA.57.19	I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to 
ISA.57.20	But the wicked 
ISA.58.1	Cry aloud, spare not, lift up your
ISA.58.2	Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God-Elōhīm 
ISA.58.3	For what reason have we fasted, 
ISA.58.4	Behold, you
ISA.58.5	Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? 
ISA.58.8	Then shall your
ISA.58.9	Then shall you
ISA.58.10	And 
ISA.58.11	And the 
ISA.58.12	And 
ISA.58.13	If you
ISA.58.14	Then shall you
ISA.59.1	Behold, the 
ISA.59.2	But your iniquities have separated between you and your God-Elōhīm 
ISA.59.3	For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue has muttered perverseness.
ISA.59.4	None calls for justice, nor 
ISA.59.5	They hatch Cockatrice (venomous snake)’ eggs, and weave the spider’s web: he that eats of their eggs dies, and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper.
ISA.59.6	Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works 
ISA.59.7	Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts 
ISA.59.8	The way of peace they know not; and 
ISA.59.9	Therefore is judgment far from us, neither does justice overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, 
ISA.59.10	We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if 
ISA.59.11	We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but 
ISA.59.12	For our transgressions are multiplied before you
ISA.59.13	In transgressing and lying against the 
ISA.59.14	And judgment is turned away backward, and justice stands afar off: for tis fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.
ISA.59.15	Yes, tfails; and he 
ISA.59.16	And he saw that 
ISA.59.17	For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance 
ISA.59.18	According to 
ISA.59.19	So shall they fear the name of the 
ISA.59.20	And the Redeemer shall come to Tziyon 
ISA.59.21	As for me, this 
ISA.60.1	Arise, shine; for your
ISA.60.2	For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the 
ISA.60.3	And the Gentiles shall come to your
ISA.60.4	Lift up you
ISA.60.5	Then you
ISA.60.6	The multitude of camels shall cover you
ISA.60.7	All the flocks of Kedar 
ISA.60.8	Who 
ISA.60.9	Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish 
ISA.60.10	And the sons of strangers shall build up your
ISA.60.11	Therefore your
ISA.60.12	For the nation and kingdom that will not serve you
ISA.60.13	The glory of L’vanon 
ISA.60.14	The sons also of them that afflicted you
ISA.60.15	Whereas you
ISA.60.16	You
ISA.60.17	For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make you
ISA.60.18	Violence shall no more be heard in your
ISA.60.19	The sun shall be no more your
ISA.60.20	Your
ISA.60.21	Your
ISA.60.22	A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I the 
ISA.61.1	The Spirit of the Lord-Adonai 
ISA.61.2	To proclaim the acceptable year of the 
ISA.61.3	To appoint unto them that mourn in Tziyon 
ISA.61.4	And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.
ISA.61.5	And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien 
ISA.61.6	But you
ISA.61.7	For your shame [you
ISA.61.8	For I the 
ISA.61.9	And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they 
ISA.61.10	I will greatly rejoice in the 
ISA.61.11	For as the earth brings forth her bud, and as the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord-Adonai 
ISA.62.1	For Tziyon 
ISA.62.2	And the Gentiles shall see you
ISA.62.3	You
ISA.62.4	You
ISA.62.5	For 
ISA.62.6	I have set watchmen upon your
ISA.62.7	And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Yerushalayim 
ISA.62.8	The 
ISA.62.9	But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the 
ISA.62.10	Go through, go through the gates; prepare you
ISA.62.11	Behold, the 
ISA.62.12	And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the 
ISA.63.1	Who 
ISA.63.2	For what reason [are you
ISA.63.3	I have trampled the winepress alone; and of the people 
ISA.63.4	For the day of vengeance 
ISA.63.5	And I looked, and 
ISA.63.6	And I will trample down the people in my anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.
ISA.63.7	I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the 
ISA.63.8	For he said, Surely they 
ISA.63.9	In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bore them, and carried them all the days of old.
ISA.63.10	But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, 
ISA.63.11	Then he remembered the days of old, Moshe 
ISA.63.12	That led 
ISA.63.13	That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness, 
ISA.63.14	As a beast goes down into the valley, the Spirit of the 
ISA.63.15	Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of you
ISA.63.16	Doubtless you
ISA.63.17	O 
ISA.63.18	The people of your
ISA.63.19	We are 
ISA.64.1	Oh that you
ISA.64.2	As 
ISA.64.3	When you
ISA.64.4	For since the beginning of the world 
ISA.64.5	You
ISA.64.6	But we are all as an unclean 
ISA.64.7	And 
ISA.64.8	But now, O 
ISA.64.9	Be not exceedingly angry very sore, O 
ISA.64.10	Your
ISA.64.11	Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised you
ISA.64.12	Will you
ISA.65.1	I am sought of 
ISA.65.2	I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walks in a way 
ISA.65.3	A people that provokes me to anger continually to my face; that sacrifices in gardens, and burns incense upon altars of brick;
ISA.65.4	Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine’s flesh, and broth of abominable 
ISA.65.5	Which say, Stand by yourself, come not near to me; for I am holier than you
ISA.65.6	Behold, 
ISA.65.7	Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, says the 
ISA.65.8	Thus says the 
ISA.65.9	And I will bring forth a seed out of Ya’akov 
ISA.65.10	And Sharon 
ISA.65.11	But you
ISA.65.12	Therefore will I number you to the sword, and you
ISA.65.13	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
ISA.65.14	Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but you
ISA.65.15	And you
ISA.65.16	That he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God-Elōhīm 
ISA.65.17	For, behold, I am creating 
ISA.65.18	But be you
ISA.65.19	And I will rejoice in Yerushalayim 
ISA.65.20	There shall be no more there an infant of days, nor an old man that has not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner 
ISA.65.21	And they shall build houses, and inhabit 
ISA.65.22	They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree 
ISA.65.23	They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they 
ISA.65.24	And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
ISA.65.25	The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust 
ISA.66.1	Thus says the 
ISA.66.2	For all those 
ISA.66.3	He that kills an ox 
ISA.66.4	I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke, they did not hear: but they did evil before my eyes, and chose 
ISA.66.5	Hear the word of the 
ISA.66.6	A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the 
ISA.66.7	Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child.
ISA.66.8	Who has heard such a thing? who has seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? 
ISA.66.9	Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? says the 
ISA.66.10	Rejoice you
ISA.66.11	That you
ISA.66.12	For thus says the 
ISA.66.13	As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you; and you
ISA.66.14	And when you
ISA.66.15	For, behold, the 
ISA.66.16	For by fire and by his sword will the 
ISA.66.17	They that sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one 
ISA.66.18	For I 
ISA.66.19	And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, 
ISA.66.20	And they shall bring all your brethren 
ISA.66.21	And I will also take of them for priests 
ISA.66.22	For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, says the 
ISA.66.23	And it shall come to pass, 
ISA.66.24	And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.
JER.1.1	The words of Yirmeyahu 
JER.1.2	To whom the word of the 
JER.1.3	It came also in the days of Y’hoyakim 
JER.1.4	Then the word of the 
JER.1.5	Before I formed you
JER.1.6	Then said I, Ah, Lord-Adonai 
JER.1.7	But the 
JER.1.8	Be not afraid of their faces: for I 
JER.1.9	Then the 
JER.1.10	See, I have this day set you
JER.1.11	Moreover the word of the 
JER.1.12	Then said the 
JER.1.13	And the word of the 
JER.1.14	Then the 
JER.1.15	For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, says the 
JER.1.16	And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.
JER.1.17	you
JER.1.18	For, behold, I have made you
JER.1.19	And they shall fight against you
JER.2.1	Moreover the word of the 
JER.2.2	Go and cry in the ears of Yerushalayim 
JER.2.3	Yisra’el 
JER.2.4	Hear you
JER.2.5	Thus says the 
JER.2.6	Neither said they, Where 
JER.2.7	And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when you
JER.2.8	The priests said not, Where 
JER.2.9	For what reason I will yet plead with you, says the 
JER.2.10	For pass over the isles of Kittim 
JER.2.11	Has a nation changed 
JER.2.12	Be astonished, O you
JER.2.13	For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, 
JER.2.15	The young lions roared upon him, 
JER.2.16	Also the children of Nof 
JER.2.17	Have you
JER.2.18	And now what have you
JER.2.19	Your
JER.2.20	For of old time I have broken your
JER.2.21	Yet I had planted you
JER.2.22	For though you
JER.2.23	How can you
JER.2.24	A wild ass used to the wilderness, 
JER.2.25	Withhold your
JER.2.26	As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Yisra’el 
JER.2.27	Saying to a stock, you
JER.2.28	But where 
JER.2.29	For what reason will you
JER.2.30	In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.
JER.2.31	O generation, see you
JER.2.32	Can a maid forget her ornaments, 
JER.2.33	Why prepare you
JER.2.34	Also in your
JER.2.35	Yet you
JER.2.36	Why you cheapen yourselfi, you change your
JER.2.37	Yes, you
JER.3.1	They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man’s, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but you
JER.3.2	Lift up your
JER.3.3	Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; and you
JER.3.4	Will you
JER.3.5	Will he reserve 
JER.3.6	The 
JER.3.7	And I said after she had done all these 
JER.3.8	And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Yisra’el 
JER.3.9	And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.
JER.3.10	And yet for all this her treacherous sister Y’hudah 
JER.3.11	And the 
JER.3.12	Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, you
JER.3.13	Only acknowledge your
JER.3.14	Turn, O backsliding children, says the 
JER.3.15	And I will give you pastors according to my heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.
JER.3.16	And it shall come to pass, when you
JER.3.17	At that time they shall call Yerushalayim 
JER.3.18	In those days the house of Y’hudah 
JER.3.19	But I said, How shall I put you
JER.3.20	Surely 
JER.3.21	A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping 
JER.3.22	Return, you
JER.3.23	Truly in vain 
JER.3.24	For shame has devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
JER.3.25	We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covers us: for we have sinned against the 
JER.4.1	If you
JER.4.2	And you
JER.4.3	For thus says the 
JER.4.4	Circumcise yourselves to the 
JER.4.5	Declare you
JER.4.6	Set up the Flag 
JER.4.7	The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make your
JER.4.8	For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the 
JER.4.9	And it shall come to pass at that day, says the 
JER.4.10	Then said I, Ah, Lord-Adonai 
JER.4.11	At that time shall it be said to this people and to Yerushalayim 
JER.4.13	Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots 
JER.4.14	O Yerushalayim 
JER.4.15	For a voice declares from Dan 
JER.4.16	Make you
JER.4.17	As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she has been rebellious against me, says the 
JER.4.18	Your
JER.4.19	My bowels 
JER.4.20	Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, 
JER.4.21	How long shall I see the Flag 
JER.4.22	For my people 
JER.4.23	I beheld the earth, and, lo, 
JER.4.24	I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.
JER.4.25	I beheld, and, lo, 
JER.4.26	I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place 
JER.4.27	For thus has the 
JER.4.28	For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black: because I have spoken 
JER.4.29	The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city 
JER.4.30	And 
JER.4.31	For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, 
JER.5.1	Run you
JER.5.2	And though they say, The 
JER.5.3	O 
JER.5.4	Therefore I said, Surely these 
JER.5.5	I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have known the way of the 
JER.5.6	For this reason a lion out of the forest shall slay them, 
JER.5.7	How shall I pardon you
JER.5.8	They were 
JER.5.9	Shall I not visit for these 
JER.5.10	Go you
JER.5.11	For the house of Yisra’el 
JER.5.12	They have belied 
JER.5.13	And the prophets shall become wind, and the word 
JER.5.14	For what reason thus says the 
JER.5.15	Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Yisra’el 
JER.5.16	Their quiver 
JER.5.17	And they shall eat up your
JER.5.18	Nevertheless in those days, says the 
JER.5.19	And it shall come to pass, when you
JER.5.20	Declare this in the house of Ya’akov 
JER.5.21	Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:
JER.5.22	Fear you
JER.5.23	But this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.
JER.5.24	Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the 
JER.5.25	Your iniquities have turned away these 
JER.5.26	For among my people are found wicked 
JER.5.27	As a cage is full of birds, so 
JER.5.28	They are waxen fat, they shine: yes, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.
JER.5.29	Shall I not visit for these 
JER.5.30	A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;
JER.5.31	The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love 
JER.6.1	O you
JER.6.2	I have likened the daughter of Tziyon 
JER.6.3	The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch 
JER.6.4	Prepare you
JER.6.5	Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.
JER.6.6	For thus has the 
JER.6.7	As a fountain casts out her waters, so she casts out her wickedness: violence and spoil 
JER.6.8	Be you
JER.6.9	Thus says the 
JER.6.10	To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear 
JER.6.11	Therefore I am full of the fury of the 
JER.6.12	And their houses shall be turned unto others, 
JER.6.13	For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them everyone 
JER.6.14	They have healed also the hurt 
JER.6.15	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time 
JER.6.16	Thus says the 
JER.6.17	Also I set watchmen over you, 
JER.6.18	Therefore hear, you
JER.6.19	Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, 
JER.6.20	To what purpose comes there to me incense from Sheva 
JER.6.21	Therefore thus says the 
JER.6.22	Thus says the 
JER.6.23	They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they 
JER.6.24	We have heard the fame thereof: our hands grow 
JER.6.25	Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy 
JER.6.26	O daughter of my people, gird 
JER.6.27	I have set you
JER.6.28	They 
JER.6.29	The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melts in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.
JER.6.30	Reprobate 
JER.7.1	The word that came to Yirmeyahu 
JER.7.2	Stand in the gate of the 
JER.7.3	Thus says the 
JER.7.4	Trust you
JER.7.5	For if you
JER.7.7	Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, forever and ever.
JER.7.8	Behold, you
JER.7.9	Will you
JER.7.10	And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?
JER.7.11	Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen 
JER.7.12	But go you
JER.7.13	And now, because you
JER.7.14	Therefore will I do unto 
JER.7.15	And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, 
JER.7.16	Therefore pray not you
JER.7.17	See you
JER.7.18	The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead 
JER.7.19	Do they provoke me to anger? says the 
JER.7.20	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
JER.7.21	Thus says the 
JER.7.22	For I spoke not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Mitzrayim 
JER.7.23	But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God-Elōhīm 
JER.7.24	But they listened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels 
JER.7.25	Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Mitzrayim 
JER.7.26	Yet they listened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers.
JER.7.27	Therefore you
JER.7.28	But you
JER.7.29	Cut off you
JER.7.30	For the children of Y’hudah 
JER.7.31	And they have built the high places of Tofet 
JER.7.32	Therefore, behold, the days come, says the 
JER.7.33	And the carcasses of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall frighten 
JER.7.34	Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Y’hudah 
JER.8.1	At that time, says the 
JER.8.2	And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the army of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.
JER.8.3	And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue 
JER.8.4	Moreover you
JER.8.5	Why 
JER.8.6	I listened and heard, 
JER.8.7	Yes, the stork in the heaven knows her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow 
JER.8.8	How do you
JER.8.9	The wise 
JER.8.10	Therefore will I give their wives unto others, 
JER.8.11	For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when 
JER.8.12	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, says the 
JER.8.13	I will surely consume them, says the 
JER.8.14	Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and let us be silent there: for the 
JER.8.15	We looked for peace, but no good 
JER.8.16	The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan 
JER.8.17	For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which 
JER.8.19	Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country: 
JER.8.20	The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.
JER.8.21	For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment has taken hold on me.
JER.9.1	Oh that my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!
JER.9.2	Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they 
JER.9.3	And they bend their tongues 
JER.9.4	Take you
JER.9.5	And they will deceive everyone his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, 
JER.9.6	You
JER.9.7	Therefore thus says the 
JER.9.8	Their tongue 
JER.9.9	Shall I not visit them for these 
JER.9.10	For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through 
JER.9.11	And I will make Yerushalayim 
JER.9.12	Who 
JER.9.13	And the 
JER.9.14	But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Ba’alim 
JER.9.15	Therefore thus says the 
JER.9.16	I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them.
JER.9.17	Thus says the 
JER.9.18	And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.
JER.9.19	For a voice of wailing is heard out of Tziyon 
JER.9.20	Yet hear the word of the 
JER.9.21	For death is come up into our windows, 
JER.9.22	Speak, Thus says the 
JER.9.23	Thus says the 
JER.9.24	But let him that glories glory in this, that he understands and knows me, that I 
JER.9.25	Behold, the days come, says the 
JER.9.26	Mitzrayim 
JER.10.1	Hear you
JER.10.2	Thus says the 
JER.10.3	For the customs of the people 
JER.10.4	They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.
JER.10.5	They 
JER.10.6	Forasmuch as 
JER.10.7	Who would not fear you
JER.10.8	But they are altogether cruel and foolish: the stock 
JER.10.9	Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish 
JER.10.10	But the 
JER.10.11	Thus shall you
JER.10.12	He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and has stretched out the heavens by his discretion.
JER.10.13	When he utters his voice, 
JER.10.14	Every man is cruel in 
JER.10.15	They 
JER.10.16	The portion of Ya’akov 
JER.10.17	Gather up your
JER.10.18	For thus says the 
JER.10.19	Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this 
JER.10.20	My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they 
JER.10.21	For the pastors are become cruel, and have not sought the 
JER.10.22	Behold, the noise of the report is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Y’hudah 
JER.10.23	O 
JER.10.24	O 
JER.10.25	Pour out your
JER.11.1	The word that came to Yirmeyahu 
JER.11.2	Hear you
JER.11.3	And say you
JER.11.4	Which I commanded your fathers in the day 
JER.11.5	That I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as 
JER.11.6	Then the 
JER.11.7	For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day 
JER.11.8	Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked everyone in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded 
JER.11.9	And the 
JER.11.10	They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Yisra’el 
JER.11.11	Therefore thus says the 
JER.11.12	Then shall the cities of Y’hudah 
JER.11.13	For 
JER.11.14	Therefore pray not you
JER.11.15	What has my beloved to do in my house, 
JER.11.16	The 
JER.11.17	For the 
JER.11.18	And the 
JER.11.19	But I 
JER.11.20	But, O 
JER.11.21	Therefore thus says the 
JER.11.22	Therefore thus says the 
JER.11.23	And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of ‘Anatot 
JER.12.1	Righteous 
JER.12.2	You
JER.12.3	But you
JER.12.4	How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell in it? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end.
JER.12.5	If you
JER.12.6	For even your
JER.12.7	I have forsaken my house, I have left my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.
JER.12.8	Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it cries out against me: therefore have I hated it.
JER.12.9	Mine heritage 
JER.12.10	Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trampled my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
JER.12.11	They have made it desolate, 
JER.12.12	The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the 
JER.12.13	They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, 
JER.12.14	Thus says the 
JER.12.15	And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.
JER.12.16	And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The 
JER.12.17	But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, says the 
JER.13.1	Thus says the 
JER.13.2	So I got a belt according to the word of the 
JER.13.3	And the word of the 
JER.13.4	Take the belt that you
JER.13.5	So I went, and hid it by Euphrates 
JER.13.6	And it came to pass after many days, that the 
JER.13.7	Then I went to Euphrates 
JER.13.8	Then the word of the 
JER.13.9	Thus says the 
JER.13.10	This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this belt, which is good for nothing.
JER.13.11	For as the belt cleaves to the waist of a man, so have I caused to cling to 
JER.13.12	Therefore you
JER.13.13	Then shall you
JER.13.14	And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, says the 
JER.13.15	Hear you
JER.13.16	Give glory to the 
JER.13.17	But if you
JER.13.18	Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your Principalities 
JER.13.19	The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open 
JER.13.20	Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where 
JER.13.21	What will you
JER.13.22	And if you
JER.13.23	Can the Cushi 
JER.13.24	Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passes away by the wind of the wilderness.
JER.13.25	This 
JER.13.26	Therefore will I discover 
JER.13.27	I have seen your
JER.14.1	The word of the 
JER.14.2	Y’hudah 
JER.14.3	And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, 
JER.14.4	Because the ground is chapped, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.
JER.14.5	Yes, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook 
JER.14.6	And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because 
JER.14.7	O 
JER.14.8	O the hope of Yisra’el 
JER.14.9	Why should you
JER.14.10	Thus says the 
JER.14.11	Then said the 
JER.14.12	When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.
JER.14.13	Then said I, Ah, Lord-Adonai 
JER.14.14	Then the 
JER.14.15	Therefore thus says the 
JER.14.16	And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Yerushalayim 
JER.14.17	Therefore you
JER.14.18	If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yes, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.
JER.14.19	Have you
JER.14.20	We acknowledge, O 
JER.14.21	Do not abhor 
JER.14.22	Are there 
JER.15.1	Then said the 
JER.15.2	And it shall come to pass, if they say unto you
JER.15.3	And I will appoint over them four kinds, says the 
JER.15.4	And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of M’nasheh 
JER.15.5	For who shall have pity upon you
JER.15.6	You
JER.15.7	And I will fan 
JER.15.8	Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused 
JER.15.9	She that has borne seven languishes: she has given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while 
JER.15.10	Woe is me, my mother, that you
JER.15.11	The 
JER.15.12	Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?
JER.15.13	Your
JER.15.14	And I will make 
JER.15.15	O 
JER.15.16	Your
JER.15.17	I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of your
JER.15.18	Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, 
JER.15.19	Therefore thus says the 
JER.15.20	And I will make you
JER.15.21	And I will deliver you
JER.16.1	The word of the 
JER.16.2	You
JER.16.3	For thus says the 
JER.16.4	They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried; 
JER.16.5	For thus says the 
JER.16.6	Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall 
JER.16.7	Neither shall 
JER.16.8	You
JER.16.9	For thus says the 
JER.16.10	And it shall come to pass, when you
JER.16.11	Then shall you
JER.16.12	And you
JER.16.13	Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that you
JER.16.14	Therefore, behold, the days come, says the 
JER.16.15	But, The 
JER.16.16	Behold, I will send for many fishers, says the 
JER.16.17	For my eyes 
JER.16.18	And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled my inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable and abominable things.
JER.16.19	O 
JER.16.20	Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they 
JER.16.21	Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will cause them to know my hand and my might; and they shall know that my name 
JER.17.1	The sin of Y’hudah 
JER.17.2	Whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills.
JER.17.3	O my mountain in the field, I will give your
JER.17.4	And you
JER.17.5	Thus says the 
JER.17.6	For he shall be like the heath 
JER.17.7	Blessed 
JER.17.8	For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and 
JER.17.9	The heart 
JER.17.10	I the 
JER.17.12	A glorious high throne from the beginning 
JER.17.13	O 
JER.17.14	Heal me, O 
JER.17.15	Behold, they say unto me, Where 
JER.17.16	As for me, I have not hastened from 
JER.17.17	Be not a terror unto me: you
JER.17.18	Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be confounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.
JER.17.19	Thus said the 
JER.17.20	And say unto them, Hear you
JER.17.21	Thus says the 
JER.17.22	Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the Shabbat 
JER.17.23	But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction.
JER.17.24	And it shall come to pass, if you
JER.17.25	Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David 
JER.17.26	And they shall come from the cities of Y’hudah 
JER.17.27	But if you
JER.18.1	The word which came to Yirmeyahu 
JER.18.2	Arise, and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause you
JER.18.3	Then I went down to the potter’s house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels.
JER.18.4	And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make 
JER.18.5	Then the word of the 
JER.18.6	O house of Yisra’el 
JER.18.8	If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.
JER.18.9	And 
JER.18.10	If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, which I said I would benefit them.
JER.18.11	Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Y’hudah 
JER.18.12	And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will everyone do the imagination of his evil heart.
JER.18.13	Therefore thus says the 
JER.18.14	Will 
JER.18.15	Because my people has forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways 
JER.18.16	To make their land desolate, 
JER.18.17	I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.
JER.18.18	Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Yirmeyahu 
JER.18.19	Give heed to me, O 
JER.18.20	Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have excavated a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before you
JER.18.21	Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their 
JER.18.22	Let a cry be heard from their houses, when you
JER.18.23	Yet, 
JER.19.1	Thus says the 
JER.19.2	And go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom 
JER.19.3	And say, Hear you
JER.19.4	Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Y’hudah 
JER.19.5	They have built also the high places of Ba’al 
JER.19.6	Therefore, behold, the days come, says the 
JER.19.7	And I will make void the counsel of Y’hudah 
JER.19.8	And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; everyone that passes thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof.
JER.19.9	And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat everyone the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness, which their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall distress them.
JER.19.10	Then shall you
JER.19.11	And shall say unto them, Thus says the 
JER.19.12	Thus will I do unto this place, says the 
JER.19.13	And the houses of Yerushalayim 
JER.19.14	Then came Yirmeyahu 
JER.19.15	Thus says the 
JER.20.1	Now Pash’chur 
JER.20.2	Then Pash’chur 
JER.20.3	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pash’chur 
JER.20.4	For thus says the 
JER.20.5	Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Y’hudah 
JER.20.6	And you
JER.20.7	O 
JER.20.8	For since I spoke, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil 
JER.20.9	Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his Name. But 
JER.20.10	For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, 
JER.20.11	But the 
JER.20.12	But, O 
JER.20.13	Sing unto the 
JER.20.14	Cursed 
JER.20.15	Cursed 
JER.20.16	And let that man be as the cities which the 
JER.20.17	Because he killed me not from the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb 
JER.20.18	For what reason came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?
JER.21.1	The word which came unto Yirmeyahu 
JER.21.2	Enquire, I pray you
JER.21.3	Then said Yirmeyahu 
JER.21.4	Thus says the 
JER.21.5	And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.
JER.21.6	And I will strike the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.
JER.21.7	And afterward, says the 
JER.21.8	And unto this people you
JER.21.9	He that abides in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goes out, and falls to the Kasdim 
JER.21.10	For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, says the 
JER.21.11	And touching the house of the king of Y’hudah 
JER.21.12	O house of David 
JER.21.13	Behold, I 
JER.21.14	But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, says the 
JER.22.1	Thus says the 
JER.22.2	And say, Hear the word of the 
JER.22.3	Thus says the 
JER.22.4	For if you
JER.22.5	But if you
JER.22.6	For thus says the 
JER.22.7	And I will prepare destroyers against you
JER.22.8	And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbour, For what reason has the 
JER.22.9	Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the 
JER.22.10	Weep you
JER.22.11	For thus says the 
JER.22.12	But he shall die in the place to which they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more.
JER.22.13	Woe unto him that builds his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; 
JER.22.14	That says, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cuts him out windows; and [it’s] cieling with cedar, and painted with vermilion.
JER.22.15	Shalt you
JER.22.16	He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then 
JER.22.17	But your
JER.22.18	Therefore thus says the 
JER.22.19	He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Yerushalayim 
JER.22.20	Go up to L’vanon 
JER.22.21	I spoke unto you
JER.22.22	The wind shall eat up all your
JER.22.23	O inhabitant of L’vanon 
JER.22.25	And I will give you
JER.22.26	And I will cast you
JER.22.27	But to the land whereunto they desire to return, there shall they not return.
JER.22.29	O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the 
JER.22.30	Thus says the 
JER.23.1	Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! says the 
JER.23.2	Therefore thus says the 
JER.23.3	And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries to which I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.
JER.23.4	And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, says the 
JER.23.5	Behold, the days come, says the 
JER.23.6	In his days Y’hudah 
JER.23.7	Therefore, behold, the days come, says the 
JER.23.8	But, The 
JER.23.9	Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine has overcome, because of the 
JER.23.10	For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourns; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force 
JER.23.11	For both prophet and priest are Profane 
JER.23.12	For what reason their way shall be unto them as slippery 
JER.23.13	And I have seen folly in the prophets of Shomron 
JER.23.14	I have seen also in the prophets of Yerushalayim 
JER.23.15	Therefore thus says the 
JER.23.16	Thus says the 
JER.23.17	They say still unto them that despise me, The 
JER.23.18	For who has stood in the counsel of the 
JER.23.19	Behold, a whirlwind of the 
JER.23.20	The anger of the 
JER.23.21	I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.
JER.23.22	But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.
JER.23.24	Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? says the 
JER.23.25	I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.
JER.23.26	How long shall 
JER.23.27	Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Ba’al 
JER.23.28	The prophet that has a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that has my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What 
JER.23.30	Therefore, behold, I 
JER.23.31	Behold, I 
JER.23.32	Behold, I 
JER.23.33	And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask you
JER.23.34	And 
JER.23.35	Thus shall you
JER.23.36	And the burden of the 
JER.23.37	Thus shall you
JER.23.38	But since you
JER.23.39	Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, 
JER.23.40	And I will bring an everlasting reproach 
JER.24.1	The 
JER.24.2	One basket 
JER.24.3	Then said the 
JER.24.4	Again the word of the 
JER.24.5	Thus says the 
JER.24.6	For I will set my eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull 
JER.24.7	And I will give them an heart to know me, that I 
JER.24.8	And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus says the 
JER.24.9	And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for 
JER.24.10	And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.
JER.25.1	The word that came to Yirmeyahu 
JER.25.2	The which Yirmeyahu 
JER.25.3	From the thirteenth year of Yoshiyahu 
JER.25.4	And the 
JER.25.5	They said, Turn you
JER.25.6	And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.
JER.25.7	Yet you
JER.25.8	Therefore thus says the 
JER.25.9	Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, says the 
JER.25.10	Moreover I will take from them the voice of gladness, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle.
JER.25.11	And this whole land shall be a desolation, 
JER.25.12	And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, 
JER.25.13	And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, 
JER.25.14	For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.
JER.25.15	For thus says the 
JER.25.16	And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.
JER.25.17	Then took I the cup at the 
JER.25.19	Par’oh 
JER.25.20	And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Utz 
JER.25.21	Edom 
JER.25.22	And all the kings of Tzor 
JER.25.23	D’dan 
JER.25.24	And all the kings of Arabia 
JER.25.25	And all the kings of Zimri 
JER.25.26	And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which 
JER.25.27	Therefore you
JER.25.28	And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at your
JER.25.29	For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should you
JER.25.30	Therefore prophesy you
JER.25.31	A noise shall come 
JER.25.32	Thus says the 
JER.25.33	And the slain of the 
JER.25.34	Howl, you
JER.25.35	And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.
JER.25.36	A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, 
JER.25.37	And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the 
JER.25.38	He has forsaken his colonnade, as the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.
JER.26.1	In the beginning of the reign of Y’hoyakim 
JER.26.2	Thus says the 
JER.26.3	If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.
JER.26.4	And you
JER.26.5	To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending 
JER.26.6	Then will I make this house like Shiloh 
JER.26.7	So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Yirmeyahu 
JER.26.8	Now it came to pass, when Yirmeyahu 
JER.26.9	Why have you
JER.26.10	When the princes of Y’hudah 
JER.26.11	Then spoke the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man 
JER.26.12	Then spoke Yirmeyahu 
JER.26.13	Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the 
JER.26.14	As for me, behold, I 
JER.26.15	But know you
JER.26.16	Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man 
JER.26.17	Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,
JER.26.18	Mikhay’hu 
JER.26.19	Did Hizkiyahu 
JER.26.20	And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the 
JER.26.21	And when Y’hoyakim 
JER.26.22	And Y’hoyakim 
JER.26.23	And they fetched forth Uriyah 
JER.26.24	Nevertheless the hand of Achikam 
JER.27.1	In the beginning of the reign of Y’hoyakim 
JER.27.2	Thus says the 
JER.27.3	And send them to the king of Edom 
JER.27.4	And command them to say unto their masters, Thus says the 
JER.27.5	I have made the earth, the man and the beast that 
JER.27.6	And now have I given all these lands into the hand of N’vukhadnetzar 
JER.27.7	And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son’s son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.
JER.27.8	And it shall come to pass, 
JER.27.9	Therefore hearken not you
JER.27.10	For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and you
JER.27.11	But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Bavel 
JER.27.12	I spoke also to Tzidkiyah 
JER.27.13	Why will you
JER.27.14	Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, You
JER.27.15	For I have not sent them, says the 
JER.27.16	Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus says the 
JER.27.17	Listen not unto them; serve the king of Bavel 
JER.27.18	But if they 
JER.27.19	For thus says the 
JER.27.20	Which N’vukhadnetzar 
JER.27.21	Yes, thus says the 
JER.27.22	They shall be carried to Bavel 
JER.28.1	And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Tzidkiyah 
JER.28.2	Thus speaks the 
JER.28.3	Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the 
JER.28.4	And I will bring again to this place Y’khanyahu 
JER.28.5	Then the prophet Yirmeyahu 
JER.28.6	Even the prophet Yirmeyahu 
JER.28.7	Nevertheless hear you
JER.28.8	The prophets that have been before me and before you
JER.28.9	The prophet which prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, 
JER.28.10	Then Hananyah 
JER.28.11	And Hananyah 
JER.28.12	Then the word of the 
JER.28.13	Go and tell Hananyah 
JER.28.14	For thus says the 
JER.28.15	Then said the prophet Yirmeyahu 
JER.28.16	Therefore thus says the 
JER.28.17	So Hananyah 
JER.29.1	Now these 
JER.29.2	(After that Y’khanyahu 
JER.29.3	By the hand of El’asah 
JER.29.4	Thus says the 
JER.29.5	Build you
JER.29.6	Take you
JER.29.7	And seek the peace of the city to which I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the 
JER.29.8	For thus says the 
JER.29.9	For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, says the 
JER.29.10	For thus says the 
JER.29.11	For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the 
JER.29.12	Then shall you
JER.29.13	And you
JER.29.14	And I will be found of you, says the 
JER.29.15	Because you
JER.29.17	Thus says the 
JER.29.18	And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach 
JER.29.19	Because they have not listened to my words, says the 
JER.29.20	Hear you
JER.29.21	Thus says the 
JER.29.22	And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Y’hudah 
JER.29.23	Because they have committed villainy in Yisra’el 
JER.29.25	Thus speaks the 
JER.29.26	The 
JER.29.27	Now therefore why have you
JER.29.28	For therefore he sent unto us 
JER.29.29	And Tzefan’yahu 
JER.29.30	Then came the word of the 
JER.29.31	Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus says the 
JER.29.32	Therefore thus says the 
JER.30.1	The word that came to Yirmeyahu 
JER.30.2	Thus speaks the 
JER.30.3	For, lo, the days come, says the 
JER.30.4	And these 
JER.30.5	For thus says the 
JER.30.6	Ask you
JER.30.7	Alas! for that day 
JER.30.8	For it shall come to pass in that day, says the 
JER.30.9	But they shall serve the 
JER.30.10	Therefore fear you
JER.30.11	For I 
JER.30.12	For thus says the 
JER.30.14	All your
JER.30.15	Why cry you
JER.30.16	Therefore all they that devour you
JER.30.17	For I will restore health unto you
JER.30.18	Thus says the 
JER.30.19	And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.
JER.30.20	Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.
JER.30.21	And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who 
JER.30.22	And you
JER.30.23	Behold, the whirlwind of the 
JER.30.24	The fierce anger of the 
JER.31.1	At the same time, says the 
JER.31.2	Thus says the 
JER.31.3	The 
JER.31.4	Again I will build you
JER.31.5	you
JER.31.6	For there shall be a day, 
JER.31.7	For thus says the 
JER.31.8	Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, 
JER.31.9	They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Yisra’el 
JER.31.10	Hear the word of the 
JER.31.11	For the 
JER.31.12	Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Tziyon 
JER.31.13	Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
JER.31.14	And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, says the 
JER.31.15	Thus says the 
JER.31.16	Thus says the 
JER.31.17	And there is hope in your
JER.31.18	I have surely heard Efrayim 
JER.31.19	Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I struck upon 
JER.31.21	Set you
JER.31.22	How long will you
JER.31.23	Thus says the 
JER.31.24	And there shall dwell in Y’hudah 
JER.31.25	For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.
JER.31.26	Upon this I awakened, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.
JER.31.27	Behold, the days come, says the 
JER.31.28	And it shall come to pass, 
JER.31.29	In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.
JER.31.30	But everyone shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eats the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.
JER.31.31	Behold, the days come, says the 
JER.31.32	Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day 
JER.31.33	But this 
JER.31.34	And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the 
JER.31.35	Thus says the 
JER.31.36	If those ordinances depart from before me, says the 
JER.31.37	Thus says the 
JER.31.38	Behold, the days come, says the 
JER.31.39	And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Garev 
JER.31.40	And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron 
JER.32.1	The word that came to Yirmeyahu 
JER.32.2	For then the king of Bavel 
JER.32.3	For Tzidkiyah 
JER.32.4	And Tzidkiyah 
JER.32.5	And he shall lead Tzidkiyah 
JER.32.6	And Yirmeyahu 
JER.32.7	Behold, ‘Hanam’el 
JER.32.8	So ‘Hanam’el 
JER.32.9	And I bought the field of ‘Hanam’el 
JER.32.10	And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed 
JER.32.11	So I took the evidence of the purchase, 
JER.32.12	And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Barukh 
JER.32.13	And I charged Barukh 
JER.32.14	Thus says the 
JER.32.15	For thus says the 
JER.32.16	Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Barukh [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)] the son of Neriyah 
JER.32.17	Ah Lord-Adonai 
JER.32.18	you
JER.32.19	Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for your
JER.32.20	Which have set signs and wonders in the land of Mitzrayim 
JER.32.21	And have brought forth your
JER.32.22	And have given them this land, which you
JER.32.23	And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not your
JER.32.24	Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Kasdim 
JER.32.25	And you
JER.32.26	Then came the word of the 
JER.32.27	Behold, I 
JER.32.28	Therefore thus says the 
JER.32.29	And the Kasdim 
JER.32.30	For the people of Yisra’el 
JER.32.31	For this city has been to me 
JER.32.32	Because of all the evil of the people of Yisra’el 
JER.32.33	And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching 
JER.32.34	But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.
JER.32.35	And they built the high places of Ba’al 
JER.32.36	And now therefore thus says the 
JER.32.37	Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, to which I have driven them in my anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:
JER.32.38	And they shall be my people, and I will be their God-Elōhīm 
JER.32.39	And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me forever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:
JER.32.40	And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.
JER.32.41	Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.
JER.32.42	For thus says the 
JER.32.43	And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof you
JER.32.44	Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal 
JER.33.1	Moreover the word of the 
JER.33.2	Thus says the 
JER.33.3	Call unto me, and I will answer you
JER.33.4	For thus says the 
JER.33.5	They come to fight with the Kasdim 
JER.33.6	Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.
JER.33.7	And I will cause the captivity of Y’hudah 
JER.33.8	And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me.
JER.33.9	And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it.
JER.33.10	Thus says the 
JER.33.11	The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the 
JER.33.12	Thus says the 
JER.33.13	In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Binyamin 
JER.33.14	Behold, the days come, says the 
JER.33.15	In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of Righteousness to grow up unto David 
JER.33.16	In those days shall Y’hudah 
JER.33.17	For thus says the 
JER.33.18	Neither shall the priests the Levi’im 
JER.33.19	And the word of the 
JER.33.20	Thus says the 
JER.33.22	As the army of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David 
JER.33.23	Moreover the word of the 
JER.33.24	Consider you
JER.33.25	Thus says the 
JER.33.26	Then will I cast away the seed of Ya’akov 
JER.34.1	The word which came unto Yirmeyahu 
JER.34.2	Thus says the 
JER.34.3	And you
JER.34.4	Yet hear the word of the 
JER.34.6	Then Yirmeyahu 
JER.34.7	When the king of Bavel 
JER.34.9	That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, 
JER.34.10	Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that everyone should let his manservant, and everyone his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them anymore, then they obeyed, and let 
JER.34.11	But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.
JER.34.12	Therefore the word of the 
JER.34.13	Thus says the 
JER.34.14	At the end of seven years let you
JER.34.15	And you
JER.34.16	But you
JER.34.17	Therefore thus says the 
JER.34.18	And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in two, and passed between the parts thereof,
JER.34.19	The princes of Y’hudah 
JER.34.20	I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.
JER.34.21	And Tzidkiyah 
JER.34.22	Behold, I will command, says the 
JER.35.1	The word which came unto Yirmeyahu 
JER.35.2	Go unto the house of the Rekhavim 
JER.35.3	Then I took Ya’azanyahu 
JER.35.4	And I brought them into the house of the 
JER.35.5	And I set before the sons of the house of the Rekhavim 
JER.35.6	But they said, We will drink no wine: for Yonadav 
JER.35.7	Neither shall you
JER.35.8	Thus have we obeyed the voice of Yonadav 
JER.35.9	Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:
JER.35.10	But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Yonadav 
JER.35.11	But it came to pass, when N’vukhadretzar 
JER.35.12	Then came the word of the 
JER.35.13	Thus says the 
JER.35.14	The words of Yonadav 
JER.35.15	I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending 
JER.35.16	Because the sons of Yonadav 
JER.35.17	Therefore thus says the 
JER.35.18	And Yirmeyahu 
JER.35.19	Therefore thus says the 
JER.36.1	And it came to pass in the fourth year of Y’hoyakim 
JER.36.2	Take you
JER.36.3	It may be that the house of Y’hudah 
JER.36.4	Then Yirmeyahu 
JER.36.5	And Yirmeyahu 
JER.36.6	Therefore go you
JER.36.7	It may be they will present their supplication before the 
JER.36.8	And Barukh 
JER.36.9	And it came to pass in the fifth year of Y’hoyakim 
JER.36.10	Then read Barukh 
JER.36.11	When Mikhayah 
JER.36.12	Then he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, 
JER.36.13	Then Mikhayah 
JER.36.14	Therefore all the princes sent Y’hudi 
JER.36.15	And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Barukh 
JER.36.16	Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Barukh 
JER.36.17	And they asked Barukh 
JER.36.18	Then Barukh 
JER.36.19	Then said the princes unto Barukh 
JER.36.20	And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama 
JER.36.21	So the king sent Y’hudi 
JER.36.22	Now the king sat in the winter house in the ninth month: and 
JER.36.23	And it came to pass, 
JER.36.24	Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, 
JER.36.25	Nevertheless Elnatan 
JER.36.26	But the king commanded Yerachme’el 
JER.36.27	Then the word of the 
JER.36.28	Take you
JER.36.29	And you
JER.36.30	Therefore thus says the 
JER.36.31	And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Yerushalayim 
JER.36.32	Then took Yirmeyahu 
JER.37.1	And king Tzidkiyah 
JER.37.2	But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the 
JER.37.3	And Tzidkiyah 
JER.37.4	Now Yirmeyahu 
JER.37.5	Then Par’oh’s 
JER.37.6	Then came the word of the 
JER.37.7	Thus says the 
JER.37.8	And the Kasdim 
JER.37.9	Thus says the 
JER.37.10	For though you
JER.37.11	And it came to pass, that when the army of the Kasdim 
JER.37.12	Then Yirmeyahu 
JER.37.13	And when he was in the gate of Binyamin 
JER.37.14	Then said Yirmeyahu 
JER.37.15	For what reason the princes were exceedingly angry with Yirmeyahu 
JER.37.16	When Yirmeyahu 
JER.37.17	Then Tzidkiyah 
JER.37.18	Moreover Yirmeyahu 
JER.37.19	Where 
JER.37.20	Therefore hear now, I pray you
JER.37.21	Then Tzidkiyah 
JER.38.1	Then Sh’fatyah 
JER.38.2	Thus says the 
JER.38.3	Thus says the 
JER.38.4	Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech 
JER.38.5	Then Tzidkiyah 
JER.38.6	Then took they Yirmeyahu 
JER.38.7	Now when ‘Eved-Melekh 
JER.38.8	‘Eved-Melekh 
JER.38.9	My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Yirmeyahu 
JER.38.10	Then the king commanded ‘Eved-Melekh 
JER.38.11	So ‘Eved-Melekh 
JER.38.12	And ‘Eved-Melekh 
JER.38.13	So they drew up Yirmeyahu 
JER.38.14	Then Tzidkiyah 
JER.38.15	Then Yirmeyahu 
JER.38.16	So Tzidkiyah 
JER.38.17	Then said Yirmeyahu 
JER.38.18	But if you
JER.38.19	And Tzidkiyah 
JER.38.20	But Yirmeyahu 
JER.38.21	But if you
JER.38.22	And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Y’hudah 
JER.38.23	So they shall bring out all your
JER.38.24	Then said Tzidkiyah 
JER.38.25	But if the princes hear that I have talked with you
JER.38.26	Then you
JER.38.27	Then came all the princes unto Yirmeyahu 
JER.38.28	So Yirmeyahu 
JER.39.1	In the ninth year of Tzidkiyah 
JER.39.3	And all the princes of the king of Bavel 
JER.39.4	And it came to pass, 
JER.39.5	But the Kasdim 
JER.39.6	Then the king of Bavel 
JER.39.7	Moreover he put out Tzidkiyah’s 
JER.39.8	And the Kasdim 
JER.39.9	Then N’vuzar’adan 
JER.39.10	But N’vuzar’adan 
JER.39.11	Now N’vukhadretzar 
JER.39.12	Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto you
JER.39.13	So N’vuzar’adan 
JER.39.14	Even they sent, and took Yirmeyahu 
JER.39.15	Now the word of the 
JER.39.16	Go and speak to ‘Eved-Melekh 
JER.39.17	But I will deliver you
JER.39.18	For I will surely deliver you
JER.40.1	The word that came to Yirmeyahu 
JER.40.2	And the captain of the guard took Yirmeyahu 
JER.40.3	Now the 
JER.40.4	And now, behold, I loose you
JER.40.5	Now while he was not yet gone back, 
JER.40.6	Then went Yirmeyahu 
JER.40.7	Now when all the captains of the forces which 
JER.40.8	Then they came to G’dalyahu 
JER.40.9	And G’dalyahu 
JER.40.10	As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mitzpah 
JER.40.11	Likewise when all the Y’hudim 
JER.40.12	Even all the Y’hudim 
JER.40.13	Moreover Yochanan 
JER.40.14	And said unto him, Do you
JER.40.15	Then Yochanan 
JER.40.16	But G’dalyahu 
JER.41.1	Now it came to pass in the seventh month, 
JER.41.2	Then arose Yishma’el 
JER.41.3	Yishma’el 
JER.41.4	And it came to pass the second day after he had slain G’dalyahu 
JER.41.5	That there came certain from Sh’khem 
JER.41.6	And Yishma’el 
JER.41.7	And it was 
JER.41.8	But ten men were found among them that said unto Yishma’el 
JER.41.9	Now the pit wherein Yishma’el 
JER.41.10	Then Yishma’el 
JER.41.11	But when Yochanan 
JER.41.12	Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Yishma’el 
JER.41.13	Now it came to pass, 
JER.41.14	So all the people that Yishma’el 
JER.41.15	But Yishma’el 
JER.41.16	Then took Yochanan 
JER.41.17	And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Khimham 
JER.41.18	Because of the Kasdim 
JER.42.1	Then all the captains of the forces, and Yochanan 
JER.42.2	And said unto Yirmeyahu 
JER.42.3	That the 
JER.42.4	Then Yirmeyahu 
JER.42.5	Then they said to Yirmeyahu 
JER.42.6	Whether 
JER.42.7	And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the 
JER.42.8	Then called he Yochanan 
JER.42.9	And said unto them, Thus says the 
JER.42.10	If you
JER.42.11	Be not afraid of the king of Bavel 
JER.42.12	And I will show mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.
JER.42.13	But if you
JER.42.14	Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Mitzrayim 
JER.42.15	And now therefore hear the word of the 
JER.42.16	Then it shall come to pass, 
JER.42.17	So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Mitzrayim 
JER.42.18	For thus says the 
JER.42.19	The 
JER.42.20	For you
JER.42.21	And 
JER.42.22	Now therefore know certainly that you
JER.43.1	And it came to pass, 
JER.43.2	Then spoke ‘Azaryah 
JER.43.3	But Barukh 
JER.43.4	So Yochanan 
JER.43.5	But Yochanan 
JER.43.7	So they came into the land of Mitzrayim 
JER.43.8	Then came the word of the 
JER.43.9	Take great stones in you
JER.43.10	And say unto them, Thus says the 
JER.43.11	And when he comes, he shall strike the land of Mitzrayim 
JER.43.12	And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Mitzrayim 
JER.43.13	He shall break also the images of Beit-Shemesh 
JER.44.1	The word that came to Yirmeyahu 
JER.44.2	Thus says the 
JER.44.3	Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, 
JER.44.4	However I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending 
JER.44.5	But they listened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.
JER.44.6	For what reason my fury and my anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Y’hudah 
JER.44.7	Therefore now thus says the 
JER.44.8	In that you
JER.44.9	Have you
JER.44.10	They are not humbled 
JER.44.11	Therefore thus says the 
JER.44.12	And I will take the remnant of Y’hudah 
JER.44.13	For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Mitzrayim 
JER.44.14	So that none of the remnant of Y’hudah 
JER.44.15	Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Mitzrayim 
JER.44.17	But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goes forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Y’hudah 
JER.44.18	But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all 
JER.44.19	And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?
JER.44.20	Then Yirmeyahu 
JER.44.21	The incense that you
JER.44.22	So that the 
JER.44.23	Because you
JER.44.24	Moreover Yirmeyahu 
JER.44.25	Thus says the 
JER.44.26	Therefore hear you
JER.44.27	Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Y’hudah 
JER.44.28	Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Mitzrayim 
JER.44.29	And this 
JER.44.30	Thus says the 
JER.45.1	The word that Yirmeyahu 
JER.45.2	Thus says the 
JER.45.3	you
JER.45.4	Thus shall you
JER.45.5	And seek you
JER.46.1	The word of the 
JER.46.2	Against Mitzrayim 
JER.46.3	Order you
JER.46.4	Harness the horses; and get up, you
JER.46.5	For what reason have I seen them dismayed 
JER.46.6	Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall stumble, and fall to (to do entirely, do wholly) ward 
JER.46.7	Who 
JER.46.8	Mitzrayim 
JER.46.9	Come up, you
JER.46.10	For this 
JER.46.11	Go up into Gil’ad 
JER.46.12	The nations have heard of your
JER.46.13	The word that the 
JER.46.14	Declare you
JER.46.15	Why are your
JER.46.16	He made many to fall, yes, one fell upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.
JER.46.17	They did cry there, Par’oh 
JER.46.19	O you
JER.46.20	Mitzrayim 
JER.46.21	Also her hired men 
JER.46.22	The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood.
JER.46.23	They shall cut down her forest, says the 
JER.46.24	The daughter of Mitzrayim 
JER.46.25	The 
JER.46.26	And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of N’vukhadretzar 
JER.46.27	But fear not you
JER.46.28	Fear you
JER.47.1	The word of the 
JER.47.2	Thus says the 
JER.47.3	At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong 
JER.47.4	Because of the day that comes to spoil 
JER.47.5	Baldness is come upon ‘Azah 
JER.47.6	O you
JER.47.7	How can it be quiet, seeing the 
JER.48.1	Against Mo’av 
JER.48.3	A voice of crying 
JER.48.4	Mo’av 
JER.48.5	For in the going up of Luchit 
JER.48.6	Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath 
JER.48.7	For because you
JER.48.8	And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the 
JER.48.9	Give wings unto Mo’av 
JER.48.10	Cursed 
JER.48.11	Mo’av 
JER.48.12	Therefore, behold, the days come, says the 
JER.48.13	And Mo’av 
JER.48.14	How say you
JER.48.15	Mo’av 
JER.48.16	The calamity of Mo’av 
JER.48.17	All you
JER.48.18	You
JER.48.19	O inhabitant of ‘Aeo’er 
JER.48.20	Mo’av 
JER.48.21	And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon 
JER.48.22	And upon Divon 
JER.48.23	And upon Kiryatayim 
JER.48.24	And upon K’riot 
JER.48.25	The horn of Mo’av 
JER.48.26	Make you
JER.48.27	For was not Yisra’el 
JER.48.28	O you
JER.48.29	We have heard the pride of Mo’av 
JER.48.30	I know his wrath, says the 
JER.48.31	Therefore will I howl for Mo’av 
JER.48.32	O vine of Sivnah 
JER.48.33	And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Mo’av 
JER.48.34	From the cry of Heshbon 
JER.48.35	Moreover I will cause to cease in Mo’av 
JER.48.36	Therefore my heart shall sound for Mo’av 
JER.48.37	For every head 
JER.48.39	They shall howl, 
JER.48.40	For thus says the 
JER.48.41	K’riot 
JER.48.42	And Mo’av 
JER.48.43	Fear, and the pit, and the snare, 
JER.48.44	He that flees from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that gets up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, 
JER.48.45	They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon 
JER.48.46	Woe be unto you
JER.48.47	Yet will I bring again the captivity of Mo’av 
JER.49.1	Concerning the ‘Amon 
JER.49.2	Therefore, behold, the days come, says the 
JER.49.3	Howl, O Heshbon 
JER.49.4	For what reason glory you
JER.49.5	Behold, I will bring a fear upon you
JER.49.6	And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of ‘Amon 
JER.49.7	Concerning Edom 
JER.49.8	Flee you
JER.49.9	If grapegatherers come to you
JER.49.10	But I have made ‘Esav 
JER.49.11	Leave your
JER.49.12	For thus says the 
JER.49.13	For I have sworn by myself, says the 
JER.49.14	I have heard a rumour from the 
JER.49.15	For, lo, I will make you
JER.49.16	You
JER.49.17	Also Edom 
JER.49.18	As in the overthrow of S’dom 
JER.49.19	Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Yarden 
JER.49.20	Therefore hear the counsel of the 
JER.49.21	The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.
JER.49.22	Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Botzrah 
JER.49.23	Concerning Dammesek 
JER.49.24	Dammesek 
JER.49.25	How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!
JER.49.26	Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, says the 
JER.49.27	And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Dammesek 
JER.49.28	Concerning Kedar 
JER.49.29	Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear 
JER.49.30	Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O you
JER.49.31	Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwells without care, says the 
JER.49.32	And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil 
JER.49.33	And Hatzor 
JER.49.34	The word of the 
JER.49.35	Thus says the 
JER.49.36	And upon ‘Eilam 
JER.49.37	For I will cause ‘Eilam 
JER.49.38	And I will set my throne in ‘Eilam 
JER.49.39	But it shall come to pass in the latter days, 
JER.50.1	The word that the 
JER.50.2	Declare you
JER.50.3	For out of the north there comes up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell in it: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.
JER.50.4	In those days, and in that time, says the 
JER.50.5	They shall ask the way to Tziyon 
JER.50.6	My people has been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away 
JER.50.7	All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend 
JER.50.8	Remove out of the midst of Bavel 
JER.50.9	For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Bavel 
JER.50.10	And Kasdim 
JER.50.11	Because you
JER.50.12	Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bore you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations 
JER.50.13	Because of the wrath of the 
JER.50.14	Put yourselves in array 
JER.50.15	Shout against her round about: she has given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it 
JER.50.16	Cut off the sower from Bavel 
JER.50.17	Yisra’el 
JER.50.18	Therefore thus says the 
JER.50.19	And I will bring Yisra’el 
JER.50.20	In those days, and in that time, says the 
JER.50.21	Go up against the land of Meratayim 
JER.50.22	A sound of battle 
JER.50.23	How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Bavel 
JER.50.24	I have laid a snare for you
JER.50.25	The 
JER.50.26	Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.
JER.50.27	Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.
JER.50.28	The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Bavel 
JER.50.29	Call to (to do entirely, do wholly) gether the archers against Bavel 
JER.50.30	Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, says the 
JER.50.31	Behold, I 
JER.50.32	And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.
JER.50.33	Thus says the 
JER.50.34	Their Redeemer 
JER.50.35	A sword 
JER.50.36	A sword 
JER.50.37	A sword 
JER.50.38	A drought 
JER.50.39	Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell 
JER.50.40	As God-Elōhīm 
JER.50.41	Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.
JER.50.42	They shall hold the bow and the lance: they 
JER.50.43	The king of Bavel 
JER.50.44	Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Yarden 
JER.50.45	Therefore hear you
JER.50.46	At the noise of the taking of Bavel 
JER.51.1	Thus says the 
JER.51.2	And will send unto Bavel 
JER.51.3	Against 
JER.51.4	Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Kasdim 
JER.51.5	For Yisra’el 
JER.51.6	Flee out of the midst of Bavel 
JER.51.7	Bavel 
JER.51.8	Bavel 
JER.51.9	We would have healed Bavel 
JER.51.10	The 
JER.51.11	Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the 
JER.51.12	Set up the Flag 
JER.51.13	O you
JER.51.14	The 
JER.51.15	He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and has stretched out the heaven by his understanding.
JER.51.16	When he utters 
JER.51.17	Every man is cruel by 
JER.51.18	They 
JER.51.19	The portion of Ya’akov 
JER.51.20	You
JER.51.21	And with you
JER.51.22	With you
JER.51.23	I will also break in pieces with you
JER.51.24	And I will render unto Bavel 
JER.51.25	Behold, I 
JER.51.26	And they shall not take of you
JER.51.27	Set you
JER.51.28	Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes 
JER.51.29	And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the 
JER.51.30	The mighty men of Bavel 
JER.51.31	One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Bavel 
JER.51.32	And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.
JER.51.33	For thus says the 
JER.51.34	N’vukhadretzar 
JER.51.35	The violence done to me and to my flesh 
JER.51.36	Therefore thus says the 
JER.51.37	And Bavel 
JER.51.38	They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions’ whelps.
JER.51.39	In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, says the 
JER.51.40	I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats.
JER.51.41	How is Sheshakh 
JER.51.42	The sea is come up upon Bavel 
JER.51.43	Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwells, neither does 
JER.51.44	And I will punish Bel in Bavel 
JER.51.45	My people, go you
JER.51.46	And lest your heart faint, and you
JER.51.47	Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Bavel 
JER.51.48	Then the heaven and the earth, and all that 
JER.51.49	As Bavel 
JER.51.50	You
JER.51.51	We are confounded, because we have heard reproach 
JER.51.52	For what reason, behold, the days come, says the 
JER.51.53	Though Bavel 
JER.51.54	A sound of a cry 
JER.51.55	Because the 
JER.51.56	Because the spoiler is come upon her, 
JER.51.57	And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise 
JER.51.58	Thus says the 
JER.51.59	The word which Yirmeyahu 
JER.51.60	So Yirmeyahu 
JER.51.61	And Yirmeyahu 
JER.51.62	Then shall you
JER.51.63	And it shall be, when you
JER.51.64	And you

JER.52.5	So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Tzidkiyah 
JER.52.6	And in the fourth month, in the ninth 
JER.52.7	Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which 
JER.52.8	But the army of the Kasdim 
JER.52.9	Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Bavel 
JER.52.10	And the king of Bavel 
JER.52.11	Then he put out the eyes of Tzidkiyah 
JER.52.12	Now in the fifth month, in the tenth 
JER.52.13	And burned the house of the 
JER.52.14	And all the army of the Kasdim 
JER.52.15	Then N’vuzar’adan 
JER.52.16	But N’vuzar’adan 
JER.52.17	Also the pillars of brass that 
JER.52.18	The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass which they ministered, took they away.
JER.52.19	And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; 
JER.52.20	The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brazen bulls that 
JER.52.21	And 
JER.52.22	And a column of brass 
JER.52.23	And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; 
JER.52.24	And the captain of the guard took S’rayah 
JER.52.25	He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king’s person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.
JER.52.26	So N’vuzar’adan 
JER.52.27	And the king of Bavel 
JER.52.28	This 
JER.52.29	In the eighteenth year of N’vukhadretzar 
JER.52.30	In the three and twentieth year of N’vukhadretzar 
JER.52.31	And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Y’hoyakhin 
JER.52.32	And spoke kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that 
JER.52.33	And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life.
JER.52.34	And 
EZK.1.1	Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth 
EZK.1.2	In the fifth 
EZK.1.3	The word of the 
EZK.1.4	And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness 
EZK.1.5	Also out of the midst thereof 
EZK.1.6	And everyone had four faces, and everyone had four wings.
EZK.1.7	And their feet 
EZK.1.8	And 
EZK.1.9	Their wings 
EZK.1.10	As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.
EZK.1.11	Thus 
EZK.1.12	And they went everyone straight forward: to which the spirit was to go, they went; 
EZK.1.13	As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance 
EZK.1.14	And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
EZK.1.15	Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.
EZK.1.16	The appearance of the wheels and their work 
EZK.1.17	When they went, they went upon their four sides: 
EZK.1.18	As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings 
EZK.1.19	And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.
EZK.1.20	Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, there 
EZK.1.21	When those went, 
EZK.1.22	And the likeness of the Firmament 
EZK.1.23	And under the Firmament 
EZK.1.24	And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.
EZK.1.25	And there was a voice from the Firmament 
EZK.1.26	And above the Firmament 
EZK.1.27	And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his waist even upward, and from the appearance of his waist even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.
EZK.1.28	As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so 
EZK.2.1	And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon your
EZK.2.2	And the Spirit entered into me when he spoke unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spoke unto me.
EZK.2.3	And he said unto me, Son of man, I send you
EZK.2.4	For 
EZK.2.5	And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will refrain 
EZK.2.6	And you
EZK.2.7	And you
EZK.2.8	But you
EZK.2.9	And when I looked, behold, an hand 
EZK.2.10	And he spread it before me; and it 
EZK.3.1	Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that you
EZK.3.2	So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.
EZK.3.3	And he said unto me, Son of man, cause you
EZK.3.4	And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get you
EZK.3.5	For you
EZK.3.6	Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words you
EZK.3.7	But the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.3.8	Behold, I have made your
EZK.3.9	As an adamant harder than flint have I made your
EZK.3.10	Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto you
EZK.3.11	And go, get you
EZK.3.12	Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, 
EZK.3.14	So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the 
EZK.3.15	Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-Aviv 
EZK.3.16	And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the 
EZK.3.17	Son of man, I have made you
EZK.3.18	When I say unto the wicked, you
EZK.3.19	Yet if you
EZK.3.20	Again, When a righteous 
EZK.3.21	Nevertheless if you
EZK.3.22	And the hand of the 
EZK.3.23	Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the 
EZK.3.24	Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spoke with me, and said unto me, Go, shut yourself within you
EZK.3.25	But you
EZK.3.26	And I will make your
EZK.3.27	But when I speak with you
EZK.4.1	You
EZK.4.2	And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set 
EZK.4.3	Moreover take you
EZK.4.4	Lie you
EZK.4.5	For I have laid upon you
EZK.4.6	And when you
EZK.4.7	Therefore you
EZK.4.8	And, behold, I will lay bands upon you
EZK.4.9	Take you
EZK.4.10	And you
EZK.4.11	You
EZK.4.12	And you
EZK.4.13	And the 
EZK.4.14	Then said I, Ah Lord-Adonai 
EZK.4.15	Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given you
EZK.4.16	Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Yerushalayim 
EZK.4.17	That they may lack bread and water, and be astonished one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.
EZK.5.1	And you
EZK.5.2	You
EZK.5.3	You
EZK.5.4	Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; 
EZK.5.5	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.5.6	And she has changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that 
EZK.5.7	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.5.8	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.5.9	And I will do in you
EZK.5.10	Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of you
EZK.5.11	For what reason, 
EZK.5.12	A third part of you
EZK.5.13	Thus shall my anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the 
EZK.5.14	Moreover I will make you
EZK.5.15	So it shall be a reproach 
EZK.5.16	When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for 
EZK.5.17	So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave you
EZK.6.1	And the word of the 
EZK.6.2	Son of man, set your
EZK.6.3	And say, You
EZK.6.4	And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain 
EZK.6.5	And I will lay the dead carcasses of the people of Yisra’el 
EZK.6.6	In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.
EZK.6.7	And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and you
EZK.6.8	Yet will I leave a remnant, that you
EZK.6.9	And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations to which they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their whorish heart, which has departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and they shall loathe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.
EZK.6.10	And they shall know that I 
EZK.6.11	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.6.12	He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remains and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them.
EZK.6.13	Then shall you
EZK.6.14	So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate, yes, more desolate than the wilderness toward Divlah 
EZK.7.1	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.7.2	Also, you
EZK.7.3	Now 
EZK.7.4	And my eye shall not spare you
EZK.7.5	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.7.6	An end is come, the end is come: it watch for you
EZK.7.7	The morning is come unto you
EZK.7.8	Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon you
EZK.7.9	And my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense you
EZK.7.10	Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod has blossomed, pride has budded.
EZK.7.11	Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them 
EZK.7.12	The time is come, the day draws near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath 
EZK.7.13	For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision 
EZK.7.14	They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goes to the battle: for my wrath 
EZK.7.15	The sword 
EZK.7.16	But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, everyone for his iniquity.
EZK.7.17	All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak 
EZK.7.18	They shall also gird 
EZK.7.19	They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the 
EZK.7.20	As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations 
EZK.7.21	And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil 
EZK.7.22	My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret 
EZK.7.23	Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.
EZK.7.24	For what reason I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.
EZK.7.25	Destruction comes; and they shall seek peace, and 
EZK.7.26	Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.
EZK.7.27	The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I 
EZK.8.1	And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth 
EZK.8.2	Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his waist even downward, fire; and from his waist even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber.
EZK.8.3	And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God-Elōhīm 
EZK.8.4	And, behold, the glory of the God-Elōhīm 
EZK.8.5	Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up your
EZK.8.6	He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, see you
EZK.8.7	And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.
EZK.8.8	Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had excavated in the wall, behold a door.
EZK.8.9	And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here.
EZK.8.10	So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.8.11	And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.8.12	Then said he unto me, Son of man, have you
EZK.8.13	He said also unto me, Turn you
EZK.8.14	Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the 
EZK.8.15	Then said he unto me, Have you
EZK.8.16	And he brought me into the inner court of the 
EZK.8.17	Then he said unto me, Have you
EZK.8.18	Therefore will I also deal in fury: my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, 
EZK.9.1	He cried also in my ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man 
EZK.9.2	And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lies toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them 
EZK.9.3	And the glory of the God-Elōhīm 
EZK.9.4	And the 
EZK.9.5	And to the others he said in my hearing, Go you
EZK.9.6	Slay utterly old 
EZK.9.7	And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go you
EZK.9.8	And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord-Adonai 
EZK.9.9	Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.9.10	And as for me also, my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, 
EZK.9.11	And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which 
EZK.10.1	Then I looked, and, behold, in the Firmament 
EZK.10.2	And he spoke unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, 
EZK.10.3	Now the k’vurim 
EZK.10.4	Then the glory of the 
EZK.10.5	And the sound of the k’vurim (cherubim)’ wings was heard 
EZK.10.6	And it came to pass, 
EZK.10.7	And 
EZK.10.8	And there appeared in the k’vurim 
EZK.10.9	And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the k’vurim 
EZK.10.10	And 
EZK.10.11	When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place to which the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.
EZK.10.12	And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, 
EZK.10.13	As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel.
EZK.10.14	And everyone had four faces: the first face 
EZK.10.15	And the k’vurim 
EZK.10.16	And when the k’vurim 
EZK.10.17	When they stood, 
EZK.10.18	Then the glory of the 
EZK.10.19	And the k’vurim 
EZK.10.20	This 
EZK.10.21	Every one had four faces apiece, and everyone four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man 
EZK.10.22	And the likeness of their faces 
EZK.11.1	Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the 
EZK.11.2	Then said he unto me, Son of man, these 
EZK.11.3	Which say, 
EZK.11.4	Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O Son of man.
EZK.11.5	And the Spirit of the 
EZK.11.6	You
EZK.11.7	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.11.8	You
EZK.11.9	And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.
EZK.11.10	You
EZK.11.11	This 
EZK.11.12	And you
EZK.11.13	And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that P’latyahu 
EZK.11.14	Again the word of the 
EZK.11.15	Son of man, you
EZK.11.16	Therefore say, Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.11.17	Therefore say, Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.11.18	And they shall come there, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from there.
EZK.11.19	And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:
EZK.11.20	That they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God-Elōhīm 
EZK.11.21	But 
EZK.11.22	Then did the k’vurim 
EZK.11.23	And the glory of the 
EZK.11.24	Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God-Elōhīm 
EZK.11.25	Then I spoke unto them of the captivity all the things that the 
EZK.12.1	The word of the 
EZK.12.2	Son of man, you
EZK.12.3	Therefore, you
EZK.12.4	Then shall you
EZK.12.5	Dig you
EZK.12.6	In their sight shall you
EZK.12.7	And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I excavated through the wall with my hand; I brought 
EZK.12.8	And in the morning came the word of the 
EZK.12.9	Son of man, has not the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.12.10	Say you
EZK.12.11	Say, I 
EZK.12.12	And the prince that 
EZK.12.13	My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Bavel 
EZK.12.14	And I will scatter toward every wind all that 
EZK.12.15	And they shall know that I 
EZK.12.16	But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen to which they come; and they shall know that I 
EZK.12.17	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.12.18	Son of man, eat your
EZK.12.19	And say unto the people of the land, Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.12.20	And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and you
EZK.12.21	And the word of the 
EZK.12.22	Son of man, what 
EZK.12.23	Tell them therefore, Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.12.24	For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.12.25	For I 
EZK.12.26	Again the word of the 
EZK.12.27	Son of man, behold, 
EZK.12.28	Therefore say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.13.1	And the word of the 
EZK.13.2	Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Yisra’el 
EZK.13.3	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.13.4	O Yisra’el 
EZK.13.5	You
EZK.13.6	They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The 
EZK.13.7	Have you
EZK.13.8	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.13.9	And my hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.13.10	Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and 
EZK.13.11	Say unto them which daub 
EZK.13.12	Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where 
EZK.13.13	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.13.14	So will I break down the wall that you
EZK.13.15	Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered 
EZK.13.17	Likewise, you
EZK.13.18	And say, Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.13.19	And will you
EZK.13.20	For what reason thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.13.21	Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and you
EZK.13.22	Because with lies you
EZK.13.23	Therefore you
EZK.14.1	Then came certain of the elders of Yisra’el 
EZK.14.2	And the word of the 
EZK.14.3	Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face: should I be enquired of at all by them?
EZK.14.4	Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.14.5	That I may take the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.14.6	Therefore say unto the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.14.7	For every one of the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.14.8	And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and you
EZK.14.9	And if the prophet be deceived when he has spoken a thing, I the 
EZK.14.10	And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeks 
EZK.14.11	That the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.14.12	The word of the 
EZK.14.13	Son of man, when the land sins against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out my hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it:
EZK.14.14	Though these three men, Noach 
EZK.14.15	If I cause destructive 
EZK.14.17	Or 
EZK.14.18	Though these three men 
EZK.14.19	Or 
EZK.14.20	Though No’ah 
EZK.14.21	For thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.14.22	Yet, behold, in it shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, 
EZK.14.23	And they shall comfort you, when you
EZK.15.1	And the word of the 
EZK.15.2	Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, 
EZK.15.3	Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will 
EZK.15.4	Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devours both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for 
EZK.15.5	Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for 
EZK.15.6	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.15.7	And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from 
EZK.15.8	And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.16.1	Again the word of the 
EZK.16.2	Son of man, cause Yerushalayim 
EZK.16.3	And say, Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.16.4	And 
EZK.16.5	None eye pitied you
EZK.16.6	And when I passed by you
EZK.16.7	I have caused you
EZK.16.8	Now when I passed by you
EZK.16.9	Then washed I you
EZK.16.10	I clothed you
EZK.16.11	I decked you
EZK.16.12	And I put a jewel on your
EZK.16.13	Thus were you
EZK.16.14	And your
EZK.16.15	But you
EZK.16.16	And of your
EZK.16.17	You
EZK.16.18	And took your
EZK.16.19	My meat also which I gave you
EZK.16.20	Moreover you
EZK.16.21	That you
EZK.16.22	And in all your
EZK.16.23	And it came to pass after all your
EZK.16.25	You
EZK.16.26	You
EZK.16.27	Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over you
EZK.16.28	You
EZK.16.29	You
EZK.16.30	How weak is your
EZK.16.31	In that you
EZK.16.33	They give gifts to all whores: but you
EZK.16.34	And the contrary is in you
EZK.16.35	For this reason, O prostitute, hear the word of the 
EZK.16.36	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.16.37	Behold, therefore I will gather all your
EZK.16.38	And I will judge you
EZK.16.39	And I will also give you
EZK.16.40	They shall also bring up a company against you
EZK.16.41	And they shall burn your
EZK.16.42	So will I make my fury toward you
EZK.16.43	Because you
EZK.16.44	Behold, everyone that uses proverbs shall use 
EZK.16.45	You
EZK.16.46	And your
EZK.16.47	Yet have you
EZK.16.49	Behold, this was the iniquity of your
EZK.16.50	And they were arrogant 
EZK.16.51	Neither has Shomron 
EZK.16.52	You
EZK.16.53	When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of S’dom 
EZK.16.54	That you
EZK.16.55	When your
EZK.16.56	For your
EZK.16.57	Before your
EZK.16.58	You
EZK.16.59	For thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.16.60	Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you
EZK.16.61	Then you
EZK.16.62	And I will establish my covenant with you
EZK.16.63	That you
EZK.17.1	And the word of the 
EZK.17.2	Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.17.3	And say, Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.17.4	He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick 
EZK.17.5	He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed 
EZK.17.6	And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.
EZK.17.7	There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.
EZK.17.8	It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.
EZK.17.9	Say you
EZK.17.10	Yes, behold, 
EZK.17.11	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.17.12	Say now to the rebellious house, Know you
EZK.17.13	And has taken of the king’s seed, and made a covenant with him, and has taken an oath of him: he has also taken the mighty of the land:
EZK.17.14	That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, 
EZK.17.15	But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Mitzrayim 
EZK.17.17	Neither shall Par’oh 
EZK.17.18	Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and has done all these 
EZK.17.19	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.17.20	And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Bavel 
EZK.17.21	And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and you
EZK.17.22	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.17.23	In the mountain of the height of Yisra’el 
EZK.17.24	And all the trees of the field shall know that I the 
EZK.18.1	The word of the 
EZK.18.2	What mean you
EZK.18.4	Behold, all souls are my; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is my: the soul that sins, it shall die.
EZK.18.5	But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,
EZK.18.7	And has not oppressed any, 
EZK.18.8	He 
EZK.18.9	Has walked in my statutes, and has kept my judgments, to deal truly; he 
EZK.18.10	If he beget 
EZK.18.11	And that does not any of those 
EZK.18.12	Has oppressed the poor and needy, has spoiled by violence, has not restored the pledge, and has lifted up his eyes to the idols, has committed abomination,
EZK.18.13	Has given forth upon usury 
EZK.18.14	Now, lo, 
EZK.18.16	Neither has oppressed any, has not withheld the pledge, neither has spoiled by violence, 
EZK.18.19	Yet say you
EZK.18.20	The soul that sins, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.
EZK.18.21	But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he has committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
EZK.18.22	All his transgressions that he has committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he has done he shall live.
EZK.18.23	Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.18.24	But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, 
EZK.18.25	Yet you
EZK.18.26	When a righteous 
EZK.18.27	Again, when the wicked 
EZK.18.28	Because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
EZK.18.29	Yet says the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.18.30	Therefore I will judge you, O house of Yisra’el 
EZK.18.31	Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby you
EZK.18.32	For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dies, says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.19.1	Moreover take you
EZK.19.2	And say, What 
EZK.19.3	And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.
EZK.19.4	The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains unto the land of Mitzrayim 
EZK.19.5	Now when she saw that she had waited, 
EZK.19.6	And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, 
EZK.19.7	And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fullness thereof, by the noise of his roaring.
EZK.19.8	Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit.
EZK.19.9	And they put him in ward 
EZK.19.10	Your
EZK.19.11	And she had strong rods for the scepters of them that bore rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches.
EZK.19.12	But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.
EZK.19.13	And now she 
EZK.19.14	And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, 
EZK.20.1	And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth 
EZK.20.2	Then came the word of the 
EZK.20.3	Son of man, speak unto the elders of Yisra’el 
EZK.20.4	Will you
EZK.20.5	And say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.20.6	In the day 
EZK.20.7	Then said I unto them, Cast you
EZK.20.8	But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Mitzrayim 
EZK.20.9	But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they 
EZK.20.10	For what reason I caused them to go forth out of the land of Mitzrayim 
EZK.20.11	And I gave them my statutes, and showed them my judgments, which 
EZK.20.12	Moreover also I gave them my Shabbat, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I 
EZK.20.13	But the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.20.14	But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.
EZK.20.15	Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given 
EZK.20.16	Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my Shabbat: for their heart went after their idols.
EZK.20.17	Nevertheless my eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.
EZK.20.18	But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk you
EZK.20.19	I 
EZK.20.20	And hallow 
EZK.20.21	Yet the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which 
EZK.20.22	Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.
EZK.20.23	I lifted up my hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;
EZK.20.24	Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my Shabbat, and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols.
EZK.20.25	Wherefore I permitted them, or gave them over to, 
EZK.20.26	And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through 
EZK.20.27	Therefore, Son of man, speak unto the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.20.29	Then I said unto them, What 
EZK.20.30	For what reason say unto the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.20.31	For when you
EZK.20.32	And that which comes into your mind shall not be at all, that you
EZK.20.34	And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein you
EZK.20.35	And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face.
EZK.20.36	Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Mitzrayim 
EZK.20.37	And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:
EZK.20.38	And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Yisra’el 
EZK.20.39	As for you, O house of Yisra’el 
EZK.20.40	For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Yisra’el 
EZK.20.41	I will accept you with your soothing aroma, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein you
EZK.20.42	And you
EZK.20.43	And there shall you
EZK.20.44	And you
EZK.20.45	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.20.46	Son of man, set you
EZK.20.47	And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the 
EZK.20.48	And all flesh shall see that I the 
EZK.20.49	Then said I, Ah Lord-Adonai 
EZK.21.1	And the word of the 
EZK.21.2	Son of man, set your
EZK.21.3	And say to the and of Yisra’el 
EZK.21.4	Seeing then that I will cut off from you
EZK.21.5	That all flesh may know that I the 
EZK.21.6	Sigh therefore, you
EZK.21.7	And it shall be, when they say unto you
EZK.21.8	Again the word of the 
EZK.21.9	Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.21.10	It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make gladness? it scorns the rod of my son, 
EZK.21.11	And he has given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.
EZK.21.12	Cry and howl, Son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it 
EZK.21.13	Because 
EZK.21.14	You
EZK.21.15	I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that 
EZK.21.16	Go you
EZK.21.17	I will also strike my hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the 
EZK.21.18	The word of the 
EZK.21.19	Also, you
EZK.21.20	Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbah 
EZK.21.21	For the king of Bavel 
EZK.21.22	At his right hand was the divination for Yerushalayim 
EZK.21.23	And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to 
EZK.21.24	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.21.25	And you
EZK.21.26	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.21.27	I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no 
EZK.21.28	And you
EZK.21.29	Whiles they see vanity unto you
EZK.21.30	Shall I cause 
EZK.21.31	And I will pour out my indignation upon you
EZK.21.32	You
EZK.22.1	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.22.2	Now, you
EZK.22.3	Then say you
EZK.22.4	You
EZK.22.6	Behold, the princes of Yisra’el 
EZK.22.7	In you
EZK.22.8	You
EZK.22.9	In you
EZK.22.10	In you
EZK.22.11	And one has committed abomination with his neighbour’s wife; and another has lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in you
EZK.22.12	In you
EZK.22.13	Behold, therefore I have smitten my hand at your
EZK.22.14	Can your
EZK.22.15	And I will scatter you
EZK.22.16	And you
EZK.22.17	And the word of the 
EZK.22.18	Son of man, the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.22.19	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.22.21	Yes, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and you
EZK.22.22	As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall you
EZK.22.23	And the word of the 
EZK.22.24	Son of man, say unto her, you
EZK.22.26	Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned my holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and Profane 
EZK.22.27	Her princes in the midst thereof 
EZK.22.28	And her prophets have daubed them with untempered 
EZK.22.29	The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yes, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.
EZK.22.30	And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.
EZK.22.31	Therefore have I poured out my indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.23.1	The word of the 
EZK.23.2	Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:
EZK.23.3	And they committed cult prostitution in Mitzrayim 
EZK.23.4	And the names of them 
EZK.23.5	And Oholah 
EZK.23.7	Thus she committed her cult prostitution with them, with all them 
EZK.23.8	Neither left she her cult prostitution 
EZK.23.9	For what reason I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the children of Ashur, upon whom she doted.
EZK.23.10	These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and killed her with the sword: and she became notorious among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.
EZK.23.11	And when her sister Oholivah 
EZK.23.12	She doted upon the children of Ashur 
EZK.23.13	Then I saw that she was defiled, 
EZK.23.14	And 
EZK.23.15	Girded with girdles upon their waist, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Bavlim 
EZK.23.16	And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Kasdim 
EZK.23.17	And the Bavlim 
EZK.23.18	So she discovered her cult prostitution, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.
EZK.23.19	Yet she multiplied her cult prostitution, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the prostitute in the land of Mitzrayim 
EZK.23.20	For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh 
EZK.23.21	Thus you
EZK.23.22	Therefore, O Oholivah 
EZK.23.23	The children of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity), and all the Kasdim 
EZK.23.24	And they shall come against you
EZK.23.25	And I will set my jealousy against you
EZK.23.26	They shall also strip you
EZK.23.27	Thus will I make your
EZK.23.28	For thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.23.29	And they shall deal with you
EZK.23.30	I will do these 
EZK.23.31	You
EZK.23.32	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.23.33	you
EZK.23.34	you
EZK.23.35	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.23.36	The 
EZK.23.37	That they have committed adultery, and blood 
EZK.23.38	Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my Sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my Shabbat.
EZK.23.39	For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to Profane 
EZK.23.40	And furthermore, that you
EZK.23.41	And sat upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon you
EZK.23.42	And a voice of a multitude being at ease 
EZK.23.43	Then said I unto 
EZK.23.44	Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that plays the prostitute: so went they in unto Oholah 
EZK.23.45	And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they 
EZK.23.46	For thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.23.47	And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.
EZK.23.48	Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.
EZK.23.49	And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and you
EZK.24.1	Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth 
EZK.24.2	Son of man, write you
EZK.24.3	And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.24.4	Gather the pieces thereof into it, 
EZK.24.5	Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, 
EZK.24.6	For what reason thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.24.7	For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;
EZK.24.8	That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.
EZK.24.9	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.24.10	Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.
EZK.24.11	Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and 
EZK.24.12	She has wearied 
EZK.24.13	In your
EZK.24.14	I the 
EZK.24.15	Also the word of the 
EZK.24.16	Son of man, behold, I take away from you
EZK.24.17	Refrain 
EZK.24.18	So I spoke unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.
EZK.24.19	And the people said unto me, Will you
EZK.24.20	Then I answered them, The word of the 
EZK.24.21	Speak unto the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.24.22	And you
EZK.24.23	And your tires 
EZK.24.24	Thus Yechezk’el 
EZK.24.25	Also, you
EZK.24.27	In that day shall your
EZK.25.1	The word of the 
EZK.25.2	Son of man, set your
EZK.25.3	And say unto the ‘Amon 
EZK.25.4	Behold, therefore I will deliver you
EZK.25.5	And I will make Rabbah 
EZK.25.6	For thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.25.7	Behold, therefore I will stretch out my hand upon you
EZK.25.8	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.25.9	Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Mo’av 
EZK.25.10	Unto the men of the east with the ‘Amon 
EZK.25.11	And I will execute judgments upon Mo’av 
EZK.25.12	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.25.13	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.25.14	And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom 
EZK.25.15	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.25.16	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.25.17	And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I 
EZK.26.1	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first 
EZK.26.2	Son of man, because that Tzor 
EZK.26.3	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.26.4	And they shall destroy the walls of Tzor 
EZK.26.5	It shall be 
EZK.26.6	And her daughters which 
EZK.26.7	For thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.26.8	He shall slay with the sword your
EZK.26.9	And he shall set engines of war against you
EZK.26.10	By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover you
EZK.26.11	With the hoofs of his horses shall he trample down all your
EZK.26.12	And they shall make a spoil 
EZK.26.13	And I will cause the noise of your
EZK.26.14	And I will make you
EZK.26.15	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.26.16	Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their adorned with needlework garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at 
EZK.26.17	And they shall take up a lamentation for you
EZK.26.18	Now shall the isles tremble in the day of your
EZK.26.19	For thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.26.20	When I shall bring you
EZK.26.21	I will make you
EZK.27.1	The word of the 
EZK.27.2	Now, you
EZK.27.3	And say unto Tzor 
EZK.27.4	Your
EZK.27.5	They have made all your
EZK.27.7	Fine linen with adorned with needlework work from Mitzrayim 
EZK.27.8	The inhabitants of Tzidon 
EZK.27.9	The ancients of G’val

EZK.27.25	The ships of Tarshish 
EZK.27.26	Your
EZK.27.27	Your
EZK.27.28	The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of your
EZK.27.29	And all that handle the oar, the mariners, 
EZK.27.30	And shall cause their voice to be heard against you
EZK.27.31	And they shall make themselves utterly bald for you
EZK.27.32	And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for you
EZK.27.33	When your
EZK.27.34	In the time 
EZK.27.35	All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at you
EZK.27.36	The merchants among the people shall hiss at you
EZK.28.1	The word of the 
EZK.28.2	Son of man, say unto the prince of Tzor 
EZK.28.3	Behold, you

EZK.28.7	Behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon you
EZK.28.8	They shall bring you
EZK.28.9	Will you
EZK.28.10	you
EZK.28.11	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.28.12	Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tzor 
EZK.28.13	you
EZK.28.14	you
EZK.28.15	you
EZK.28.16	By the multitude of your
EZK.28.17	Your
EZK.28.18	you
EZK.28.19	All they that know you
EZK.28.20	Again the word of the 
EZK.28.21	Son of man, set your
EZK.28.22	And say, Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.28.23	For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I 
EZK.28.24	And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.28.25	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.28.26	And they shall dwell safely in it, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yes, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and they shall know that I 
EZK.29.1	In the tenth year, in the tenth 
EZK.29.2	Son of man, set your
EZK.29.3	Speak, and say, Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.29.4	But I will put hooks in your
EZK.29.5	And I will leave you
EZK.29.6	And all the inhabitants of Mitzrayim 
EZK.29.7	When they took hold of you
EZK.29.8	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.29.9	And the land of Mitzrayim 
EZK.29.10	Behold, therefore I 
EZK.29.11	No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.
EZK.29.12	And I will make the land of Mitzrayim 
EZK.29.13	Yet thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.29.14	And I will bring again the captivity of Mitzrayim 
EZK.29.15	It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.
EZK.29.16	And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.29.17	And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first 
EZK.29.18	Son of man, N’vukhadretzar 
EZK.29.19	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.29.20	I have given him the land of Mitzrayim 
EZK.29.21	In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.30.1	The word of the 
EZK.30.2	Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.30.3	For the day 
EZK.30.4	And the sword shall come upon Mitzrayim 
EZK.30.5	Ethiopia 
EZK.30.6	Thus says the 
EZK.30.7	And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries 
EZK.30.8	And they shall know that I 
EZK.30.9	In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid, and great pain shall come upon them, as in the day of Mitzrayim 
EZK.30.10	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.30.11	He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their swords against Mitzrayim 
EZK.30.12	And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that is in it, by the hand of strangers: I the 
EZK.30.13	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.30.14	And I will make Patros 
EZK.30.15	And I will pour my fury upon Seen 
EZK.30.16	And I will set fire in Mitzrayim 
EZK.30.17	The young men of On 
EZK.30.18	At T’chafin’ches 
EZK.30.19	Thus will I execute judgments in Mitzrayim 
EZK.30.20	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first 
EZK.30.21	Son of man, I have broken the arm of Par’oh 
EZK.30.22	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.30.23	And I will scatter the Mitzri among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
EZK.30.24	And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Bavel 
EZK.30.25	But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Bavel 
EZK.30.26	And I will scatter the Mitzri among the nations, and disperse them among the countries; and they shall know that I 
EZK.31.1	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third 
EZK.31.2	Son of man, speak unto Par’oh 
EZK.31.3	Behold, the Ashur 
EZK.31.4	The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field.
EZK.31.5	Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.
EZK.31.6	All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.
EZK.31.7	Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters.
EZK.31.8	The cedars in the garden of God-Elōhīm 
EZK.31.9	I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of ‘Eden 
EZK.31.10	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.31.11	I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.
EZK.31.12	And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.
EZK.31.13	Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:
EZK.31.14	To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the lower parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.
EZK.31.15	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.31.16	I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of ‘Eden 
EZK.31.17	They also went down into hell with him unto 
EZK.31.18	To whom are you
EZK.32.1	And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first 
EZK.32.2	Son of man, take up a lamentation for Par’oh 
EZK.32.3	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.32.4	Then will I leave you
EZK.32.5	And I will lay your
EZK.32.6	I will also water with your
EZK.32.7	And when I shall put you
EZK.32.8	All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over you
EZK.32.9	I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring your
EZK.32.10	Yes, I will make many people amazed at you
EZK.32.11	For thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.32.12	By the swords of the mighty will I cause your
EZK.32.13	I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them anymore, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.
EZK.32.14	Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.32.15	When I shall make the land of Mitzrayim 
EZK.32.16	This 
EZK.32.17	It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth 
EZK.32.18	Son of man, wail for the multitude of Mitzrayim 
EZK.32.19	Whom do you
EZK.32.20	They shall fall in the midst of 
EZK.32.21	The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword.
EZK.32.22	Ashur 
EZK.32.23	Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company is round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which caused terror in the land of the living.
EZK.32.24	There 
EZK.32.25	They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude: her graves 
EZK.32.26	There 
EZK.32.27	And they shall not lie with the mighty 
EZK.32.28	Yes, you
EZK.32.29	There 
EZK.32.30	There 
EZK.32.31	Par’oh 
EZK.32.32	For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with 
EZK.33.1	Again the word of the 
EZK.33.2	Son of man, speak to the children of your
EZK.33.3	If when he sees the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;
EZK.33.4	Then whosoever hears the sound of the trumpet, and takes not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.
EZK.33.5	He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that takes warning shall deliver his soul.
EZK.33.6	But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take 
EZK.33.7	So you
EZK.33.8	When I say unto the wicked, O wicked 
EZK.33.9	Nevertheless, if you
EZK.33.10	Therefore, O you
EZK.33.11	Say unto them, 
EZK.33.12	Therefore, you
EZK.33.13	When I shall say to the righteous, 
EZK.33.14	Again, when I say unto the wicked, you
EZK.33.16	None of his sins that he has committed shall be mentioned unto him: he has done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.
EZK.33.17	Yet the children of you
EZK.33.18	When the righteous turns from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, he shall even die thereby.
EZK.33.19	But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.
EZK.33.20	Yet you
EZK.33.21	And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth 
EZK.33.22	Now the hand of the 
EZK.33.23	Then the word of the 
EZK.33.24	Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Yisra’el 
EZK.33.25	For what reason say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.33.26	You
EZK.33.27	Say you
EZK.33.28	For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Yisra’el 
EZK.33.29	Then shall they know that I 
EZK.33.30	Also, you
EZK.33.31	And they come unto you
EZK.33.32	And, lo, you
EZK.33.33	And when this comes to pass, 
EZK.34.1	And the word of the 
EZK.34.2	Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Yisra’el 
EZK.34.3	You
EZK.34.4	The diseased have you
EZK.34.5	And they were scattered, because 
EZK.34.6	My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yes, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek 
EZK.34.7	Therefore, you
EZK.34.9	Therefore, O you
EZK.34.10	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.34.11	For thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.34.12	As a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep 
EZK.34.13	And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Yisra’el 
EZK.34.14	I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Yisra’el 
EZK.34.15	I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.34.16	I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up 
EZK.34.17	And 
EZK.34.19	And 
EZK.34.20	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.34.21	Because you
EZK.34.22	Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.
EZK.34.23	And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, 
EZK.34.24	And I the 
EZK.34.25	And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.
EZK.34.26	And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing.
EZK.34.27	And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I 
EZK.34.28	And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make 
EZK.34.29	And I will raise up for them a plant of renown (great reputation; being well-known), and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more.
EZK.34.30	Thus shall they know that I the 
EZK.34.31	And you
EZK.35.1	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.35.2	Son of man, set your
EZK.35.3	And say unto it, Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.35.4	I will lay your
EZK.35.5	Because you
EZK.35.6	Therefore, 
EZK.35.7	Thus will I make mount Se’ir 
EZK.35.8	And I will fill his mountains with his slain 
EZK.35.9	I will make you
EZK.35.10	Because you
EZK.35.11	Therefore, 
EZK.35.12	And you
EZK.35.13	Thus with your mouth you
EZK.35.14	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.35.15	As you
EZK.36.1	Also, you
EZK.36.2	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.36.3	Therefore prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.36.4	Therefore, you
EZK.36.5	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.36.6	Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Yisra’el 
EZK.36.7	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.36.8	But you
EZK.36.9	For, behold, I 
EZK.36.10	And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.36.11	And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old estates, and will do better 
EZK.36.12	Yes, I will cause men to walk upon you, 
EZK.36.13	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.36.14	Therefore you
EZK.36.15	Neither will I cause 
EZK.36.16	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.36.17	Son of man, when the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.36.18	For what reason I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols 
EZK.36.19	And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.
EZK.36.20	And when they entered unto the heathen, to which they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These 
EZK.36.21	But I had pity for my holy name, which the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.36.22	Therefore say unto the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.36.23	And I will sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which you
EZK.36.24	For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.
EZK.36.25	Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and you
EZK.36.26	A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.
EZK.36.27	And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and you
EZK.36.28	And you
EZK.36.29	I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.
EZK.36.30	And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that you
EZK.36.31	Then shall you
EZK.36.32	Not for your sakes do I 
EZK.36.33	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.36.34	And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by.
EZK.36.35	And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of ‘Eden 
EZK.36.36	Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the 
EZK.36.37	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.36.38	As the holy flock, as the flock of Yerushalayim 
EZK.37.1	The hand of the 
EZK.37.2	And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, 
EZK.37.3	And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord-Adonai 
EZK.37.4	Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O you
EZK.37.5	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.37.6	And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you
EZK.37.7	So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.
EZK.37.8	And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but 
EZK.37.9	Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, Son of man, and say to the wind, Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.37.10	So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.
EZK.37.11	Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Yisra’el 
EZK.37.12	Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.37.13	And you
EZK.37.14	And shall put my spirit in you, and you
EZK.37.15	The word of the 
EZK.37.16	Moreover, you
EZK.37.17	And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in you
EZK.37.18	And when the children of your
EZK.37.19	Say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.37.20	And the sticks whereon you
EZK.37.21	And say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.37.22	And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Yisra’el 
EZK.37.23	Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God-Elōhīm 
EZK.37.24	And David 
EZK.37.25	And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Ya’akov 
EZK.37.26	Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them forevermore.
EZK.37.27	My tabernacle also shall be with them: yes, I will be their God-Elōhīm 
EZK.37.28	And the heathen shall know that I the 
EZK.38.1	And the word of the 
EZK.38.2	Son of man, set your
EZK.38.3	And say, Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.38.4	And I will turn you
EZK.38.5	Paras 
EZK.38.6	Gomer 
EZK.38.7	Be you
EZK.38.8	After many days you
EZK.38.9	you
EZK.38.10	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.38.11	And you
EZK.38.12	To take a spoil 
EZK.38.13	Sheva 
EZK.38.14	Therefore, Son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog 
EZK.38.15	And you
EZK.38.16	And you
EZK.38.17	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.38.18	And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog 
EZK.38.19	For in my jealousy 
EZK.38.20	So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that 
EZK.38.21	And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.38.22	And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that 
EZK.38.23	Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I 
EZK.39.1	Therefore, you
EZK.39.2	And I will turn you
EZK.39.3	And I will strike your
EZK.39.4	you
EZK.39.5	you
EZK.39.6	And I will send a fire on Magog 
EZK.39.7	So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Yisra’el 
EZK.39.8	Behold, it is come, and it is done, says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.39.9	And they that dwell in the cities of Yisra’el 
EZK.39.10	So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down 
EZK.39.11	And it shall come to pass in that day, 
EZK.39.12	And seven months shall the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.39.13	Yes, all the people of the land shall bury 
EZK.39.14	And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing through the land to bury with the travelers those that remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search.
EZK.39.15	And the travelers 
EZK.39.16	And also the name of the city 
EZK.39.17	And, you
EZK.39.18	You
EZK.39.19	And you
EZK.39.20	Thus you
EZK.39.21	And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.
EZK.39.22	So the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.39.23	And the heathen shall know that the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.39.24	According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them.
EZK.39.25	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.39.26	After that they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made 
EZK.39.27	When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of their enemies’ lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations;
EZK.39.28	Then shall they know that I 
EZK.39.29	Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my Spirit upon the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.40.1	In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth 
EZK.40.2	In the visions of God-Elōhīm 
EZK.40.3	And he brought me there, and, behold, 
EZK.40.4	And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with your
EZK.40.5	And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed of six cubits 
EZK.40.6	Then came he unto the gate which looks toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, 
EZK.40.7	And 
EZK.40.8	He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.
EZK.40.9	Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate 
EZK.40.10	And the little chambers of the gate eastward 
EZK.40.11	And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; 
EZK.40.12	The space also before the little chambers 
EZK.40.13	He measured then the gate from the roof of 
EZK.40.14	He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate.
EZK.40.15	And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate 
EZK.40.16	And 
EZK.40.17	Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, 
EZK.40.18	And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates 
EZK.40.19	Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward.
EZK.40.20	And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.
EZK.40.21	And the little chambers thereof 
EZK.40.22	And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, 
EZK.40.23	And the gate of the inner court 
EZK.40.24	After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.
EZK.40.25	And 
EZK.40.26	And 
EZK.40.27	And 
EZK.40.28	And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;
EZK.40.29	And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and 
EZK.40.30	And the arches round about 
EZK.40.31	And the arches thereof 
EZK.40.32	And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures.
EZK.40.33	And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, 
EZK.40.34	And the arches thereof 
EZK.40.35	And he brought me to the north gate, and measured 
EZK.40.36	The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length 
EZK.40.37	And the posts thereof 
EZK.40.38	And the chambers and the entries thereof 
EZK.40.39	And in the porch of the gate 
EZK.40.40	And at the side without, as one goes up to the entry of the north gate, 
EZK.40.41	Four tables 
EZK.40.42	And the four tables 
EZK.40.43	And within 
EZK.40.44	And without the inner gate 
EZK.40.45	And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect 
EZK.40.46	And the chamber whose prospect 
EZK.40.47	So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, Foursquare 
EZK.40.48	And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured 
EZK.40.49	The length of the porch 
EZK.41.1	Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, 
EZK.41.2	And the breadth of the door 
EZK.41.3	Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.
EZK.41.4	So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This 
EZK.41.5	After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of 
EZK.41.6	And the side chambers 
EZK.41.7	And 
EZK.41.8	I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers 
EZK.41.9	The thickness of the wall, which 
EZK.41.10	And between the chambers 
EZK.41.11	And the doors of the side chambers 
EZK.41.12	Now the building that 
EZK.41.13	So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long;
EZK.41.14	Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits.
EZK.41.15	And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which 
EZK.41.16	The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door, ceilinged with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows 
EZK.41.17	To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.
EZK.41.18	And 
EZK.41.19	So that the face of a man 
EZK.41.20	From the ground unto above the door 
EZK.41.21	The posts of the temple 
EZK.41.22	The altar of wood 
EZK.41.23	And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
EZK.41.24	And the doors had two leaves 
EZK.41.25	And 
EZK.41.26	And 
EZK.42.1	Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that 
EZK.42.2	Before the length of an hundred cubits 
EZK.42.3	Over against the twenty 
EZK.42.4	And before the chambers 
EZK.42.5	Now the upper chambers 
EZK.42.6	For they 
EZK.42.7	And the wall that 
EZK.42.8	For the length of the chambers that 
EZK.42.9	And from under these chambers 
EZK.42.10	The chambers 
EZK.42.11	And the way before them 
EZK.42.12	And according to the doors of the chambers that 
EZK.42.13	Then said he unto me, The north chambers 
EZK.42.14	When the priests enter in it, then shall they not go out of the holy 
EZK.42.15	Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect 
EZK.42.16	He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.
EZK.42.17	He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.
EZK.42.18	He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.
EZK.42.19	He turned about to the west side, 
EZK.42.20	He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred 
EZK.43.1	Afterward he brought me to the gate, 
EZK.43.2	And, behold, the glory of the God-Elōhīm 
EZK.43.3	And 
EZK.43.4	And the glory of the 
EZK.43.5	So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the 
EZK.43.6	And I heard 
EZK.43.7	And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the people of Yisra’el 
EZK.43.8	In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in my anger.
EZK.43.9	Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcasses of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them forever.
EZK.43.10	you
EZK.43.11	And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, show them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write 
EZK.43.12	This 
EZK.43.13	And these 
EZK.43.14	And from the bottom 
EZK.43.15	So the altar 
EZK.43.16	And the altar 
EZK.43.17	And the settle 
EZK.43.18	And he said unto me, Son of man, thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.43.19	And you
EZK.43.20	And you
EZK.43.21	you
EZK.43.22	And on the second day you
EZK.43.23	When you
EZK.43.24	And you
EZK.43.25	Seven days shall you
EZK.43.26	Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate 
EZK.43.27	And when these days are expired, it shall be, 
EZK.44.1	Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looks toward the east; and it 
EZK.44.2	Then said the 
EZK.44.4	Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house: and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the 
EZK.44.5	And the 
EZK.44.6	And you
EZK.44.7	In that you
EZK.44.8	And you
EZK.44.9	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.44.10	And the Levi’im 
EZK.44.11	Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, 
EZK.44.12	Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.44.13	And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy 
EZK.44.14	But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done in it.
EZK.44.15	But the priests the Levi’im 
EZK.44.16	They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.
EZK.44.17	And it shall come to pass, 
EZK.44.18	They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have linen trousers upon their waist; they shall not gird 
EZK.44.19	And when they go forth into the outer court, 
EZK.44.20	Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads.
EZK.44.21	Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.
EZK.44.22	Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Yisra’el 
EZK.44.23	And they shall teach my people 
EZK.44.24	And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; 
EZK.44.25	And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that has had no husband, they may defile themselves.
EZK.44.26	And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days.
EZK.44.27	And in the day that he goes into the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.44.28	And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I 
EZK.44.29	They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; and every dedicated thing in Yisra’el 
EZK.44.30	And the first of all the firstfruits of all 
EZK.44.31	The priests shall not eat of anything that is dead of itself, or torn, whether it be fowl or beast.
EZK.45.1	Moreover, when you
EZK.45.2	Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred 
EZK.45.3	And of this measure shall you
EZK.45.4	The holy 
EZK.45.5	And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth, shall also the Levi’im 
EZK.45.6	And you
EZK.45.7	And a 
EZK.45.8	In the land shall be his possession in Yisra’el 
EZK.45.9	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.45.10	You
EZK.45.11	The eifah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the eifah the tenth part of an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer.
EZK.45.12	And the shekel 
EZK.45.13	This 
EZK.45.14	Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, 
EZK.45.15	And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Yisra’el 
EZK.45.16	All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Yisra’el 
EZK.45.17	And it shall be the prince’s part 
EZK.45.18	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.45.19	And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put 
EZK.45.20	And so you
EZK.45.21	In the first 
EZK.45.22	And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock 
EZK.45.23	And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the 
EZK.45.24	And he shall prepare a meat offering of an eifah for a bullock, and an eifah for a ram, and an hin 
EZK.45.25	In the seventh 
EZK.46.1	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.46.2	And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of 
EZK.46.3	Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the 
EZK.46.4	And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the 
EZK.46.5	And the meat offering 
EZK.46.6	And in the day of the new moon 
EZK.46.7	And he shall prepare a meat offering, an eifah for a bullock, and an eifah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and an hin 
EZK.46.8	And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of 
EZK.46.9	But when the people of the land shall come before the 
EZK.46.10	And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.
EZK.46.11	And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an eifah to a bullock, and an eifah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin 
EZK.46.12	Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the 
EZK.46.13	you
EZK.46.14	And you
EZK.46.15	Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning 
EZK.46.16	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.46.17	But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons’ for them.
EZK.46.18	Moreover the prince shall not take of the people’s inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; 
EZK.46.19	After he brought me through the entry, which 
EZK.46.20	Then said he unto me, This 
EZK.46.21	Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court 
EZK.46.22	In the four corners of the court 
EZK.46.23	And 
EZK.46.24	Then said he unto me, These 
EZK.47.1	Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house 
EZK.47.2	Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the outer gate by the way that looks eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.
EZK.47.3	And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters 
EZK.47.4	Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters 
EZK.47.5	Afterward he measured a thousand; 
EZK.47.6	And he said unto me, Son of man, have you
EZK.47.7	Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river 
EZK.47.8	Then said he unto me, These waters issue 
EZK.47.9	And it shall come to pass, 
EZK.47.10	And it shall come to pass, 
EZK.47.11	But the miry places thereof and the marshes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt.
EZK.47.12	And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.
EZK.47.13	Thus says the Lord-Adonai 
EZK.47.14	And you
EZK.47.15	And this 
EZK.47.16	Hamat 
EZK.47.17	And the border from the sea shall be Hatzar-’Einan 
EZK.47.18	And the east side you
EZK.47.19	And the south side southward, from Tamar 
EZK.47.20	The west side also 
EZK.47.21	So shall you

EZK.48.13	And over against the border of the priests the Levi’im 
EZK.48.14	And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor alienate the firstfruits of the land: for 
EZK.48.15	And the five thousand, that are left in the breadth over against the five and twenty thousand, shall be a Profane 
EZK.48.16	And these 
EZK.48.17	And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty.

EZK.48.33	And at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures: and three gates; one gate of Shim’on 
EZK.48.34	At the west side four thousand and five hundred, 
HOS.1.1	The word of the 
HOS.1.2	The beginning of the word of the 
HOS.1.3	So he went and took Gomer 
HOS.1.4	And the 
HOS.1.5	And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Yisra’el 
HOS.1.6	And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And [God-Elōhīm 
HOS.1.7	But I will have mercy upon the house of Y’hudah 
HOS.1.8	Now when she had weaned Lo-Ruchamah 
HOS.1.9	Then said [God-Elōhīm 
HOS.1.10	Yet the number of the people of Yisra’el 
HOS.1.11	Then shall the children of Y’hudah 
HOS.2.1	Say you
HOS.2.2	Plead with your mother, plead: for she 
HOS.2.3	Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.
HOS.2.4	And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they 
HOS.2.5	For their mother has played the prostitute: she that conceived them has done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give 
HOS.2.6	Therefore, behold, I will hedge up your
HOS.2.7	And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find 
HOS.2.8	For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, 
HOS.2.9	Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax 
HOS.2.10	And now will I reveal her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand.
HOS.2.11	I will also cause all her gladness to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her Shabbat, and all her solemn feasts.
HOS.2.12	And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she has said, These 
HOS.2.13	And I will visit upon her the days of Ba’alim 
HOS.2.14	Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.
HOS.2.15	And I will give her vineyards from there, and the valley of Akhor 
HOS.2.16	And it shall be at that day, says the 
HOS.2.17	For I will take away the names of Ba’alim 
HOS.2.18	And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and 
HOS.2.19	And I will betroth you
HOS.2.20	I will even betroth you
HOS.2.21	And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, says the 
HOS.2.22	And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Yizre’el 
HOS.2.23	And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to 
HOS.3.1	Then said the 
HOS.3.2	So I bought her to me for fifteen 
HOS.3.3	And I said unto her, you
HOS.3.4	For the people of Yisra’el 
HOS.3.5	Afterward shall the people of Yisra’el 
HOS.4.1	Hear the word of the 
HOS.4.2	By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood touches blood.
HOS.4.3	Therefore shall the land mourn, and everyone that dwells in it shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yes, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.
HOS.4.4	Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for your
HOS.4.5	Therefore shall you
HOS.4.6	My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because you
HOS.4.7	As they were increased, so they sinned against me: 
HOS.4.8	They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.
HOS.4.9	And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.
HOS.4.10	For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the 
HOS.4.11	Whoredom and wine and New Wine take away the heart.
HOS.4.12	My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declares unto them: for the spirit of cult prostitution has caused 
HOS.4.13	They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof 
HOS.4.14	I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with prostitutes: therefore the people 
HOS.4.15	Though you
HOS.4.16	For Yisra’el 
HOS.4.17	Efrayim 
HOS.4.18	Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers 
HOS.4.19	The wind has bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
HOS.5.1	Hear you
HOS.5.2	And the revolters are profound 
HOS.5.3	I know Efrayim 
HOS.5.4	They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God-Elōhīm 
HOS.5.5	And the pride of Yisra’el 
HOS.5.6	They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the 
HOS.5.7	They have dealt treacherously against the 
HOS.5.8	Blow you
HOS.5.9	Efrayim 
HOS.5.10	The princes of Y’hudah 
HOS.5.11	Efrayim 
HOS.5.12	Therefore 
HOS.5.13	When Efrayim 
HOS.5.14	For I 
HOS.5.15	I will go 
HOS.6.1	Come, and let us return unto the 
HOS.6.2	After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.
HOS.6.3	Then shall we know, 
HOS.6.4	O Efrayim 
HOS.6.5	Therefore have I hewed 
HOS.6.6	For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God-Elōhīm 
HOS.6.7	But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.
HOS.6.8	Gil’ad 
HOS.6.9	And as troops of robbers wait for a man, 
HOS.6.10	I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Yisra’el 
HOS.6.11	Also, O Y’hudah 
HOS.7.1	When I would have healed Yisra’el 
HOS.7.2	And they consider not in their hearts 
HOS.7.3	They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.
HOS.7.4	They 
HOS.7.5	In the day of our king the princes have made 
HOS.7.6	For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleeps all the night; in the morning it burns as a flaming fire.
HOS.7.7	They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: 
HOS.7.8	Efrayim 
HOS.7.9	Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knows 
HOS.7.10	And the pride of Yisra’el 
HOS.7.11	Efrayim 
HOS.7.12	When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard.
HOS.7.13	Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.
HOS.7.14	And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, 
HOS.7.15	Though I have bound 
HOS.7.16	They return, 
HOS.8.2	Yisra’el 
HOS.8.3	Yisra’el 
HOS.8.4	They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew 
HOS.8.5	You
HOS.8.6	For from Yisra’el 
HOS.8.7	For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it has no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow 
HOS.8.8	Yisra’el 
HOS.8.9	For they are gone up to Ashur 
HOS.8.10	Yes, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.
HOS.8.11	Because Efrayim 
HOS.8.12	I have written to him the great things of my law, 
HOS.8.13	They sacrifice flesh 
HOS.8.14	For Yisra’el 
HOS.9.1	Rejoice not, O Yisra’el 
HOS.9.2	The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the New Wine shall fail in her.
HOS.9.3	They shall not dwell in the 
HOS.9.4	They shall not offer wine 
HOS.9.5	What will you
HOS.9.6	For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Mitzrayim 
HOS.9.7	The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come; Yisra’el 
HOS.9.8	The watchman of Efrayim 
HOS.9.9	They have deeply corrupted 
HOS.9.10	I found Yisra’el 
HOS.9.12	Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, 
HOS.9.13	Efrayim 
HOS.9.14	Give them, O 
HOS.9.15	All their wickedness 
HOS.9.16	Efrayim 
HOS.9.17	My God-Elōhīm 
HOS.10.1	Yisra’el 
HOS.10.2	Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil 
HOS.10.3	For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the 
HOS.10.4	They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springs up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.
HOS.10.5	The inhabitants of Shomron 
HOS.10.6	It shall be also carried unto Ashur 
HOS.10.8	The high places also of On 
HOS.10.9	O Yisra’el 
HOS.10.11	And Efrayim 
HOS.10.12	Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow 
HOS.10.13	You
HOS.10.14	Therefore shall a tumult arise among your
HOS.10.15	So shall Beit-El 
HOS.11.1	When Yisra’el 
HOS.11.3	I taught Efrayim 
HOS.11.4	I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.
HOS.11.5	He shall not return into the land of Mitzrayim 
HOS.11.6	And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour 
HOS.11.7	And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt 
HOS.11.8	How shall I give you
HOS.11.9	I will not execute the fierceness of my anger, I will not return to destroy Efrayim 
HOS.11.10	They shall walk after the

HOS.11.12	Efrayim 
HOS.12.1	Efrayim 
HOS.12.2	The 
HOS.12.3	He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God-Elōhīm 
HOS.12.4	Yes, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him 
HOS.12.5	Even the

HOS.12.8	And Efrayim 
HOS.12.9	And I 
HOS.12.10	I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.
HOS.12.12	And Ya’akov 
HOS.12.13	And by a prophet the 
HOS.12.14	Efrayim 
HOS.13.1	When Efrayim 
HOS.13.2	And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, 
HOS.13.3	Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passes away, as the chaff 
HOS.13.4	Yet I 
HOS.13.5	I did know you
HOS.13.6	According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me.
HOS.13.7	Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe 
HOS.13.8	I will meet them as a bear 
HOS.13.9	O Yisra’el 
HOS.13.10	I will be your
HOS.13.11	I gave you
HOS.13.12	The iniquity of Efrayim 
HOS.13.13	The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he

HOS.14.8	Efrayim 
HOS.14.9	Who 
JOL.1.1	The word of the

JOL.1.3	Tell you
JOL.1.4	That which the palmerworm has left has the locust eaten; and that which the locust has left has the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm has left has the caterpillar eaten.
JOL.1.5	Awake, you
JOL.1.6	For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth 
JOL.1.7	He has laid my vine waste, and barked 
JOL.1.8	Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.
JOL.1.9	The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the 
JOL.1.10	The field is wasted, the land mourns; for the corn is wasted: the New Wine is dried up, the oil languishes.
JOL.1.11	Be you
JOL.1.12	The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languishes; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, 
JOL.1.13	Gird yourselves, and lament, you
JOL.1.14	Sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) you
JOL.1.15	Alas for the day! for the day of the 
JOL.1.16	Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, 
JOL.1.17	The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.
JOL.1.18	How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yes, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.
JOL.1.19	O 
JOL.1.20	The beasts of the field cry also unto you
JOL.2.1	Blow you
JOL.2.2	A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there has not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, 
JOL.2.3	A fire devours before them; and behind them a flame burns: the land 
JOL.2.4	The appearance of them 
JOL.2.5	Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array 
JOL.2.6	Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness.
JOL.2.7	They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march everyone on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks:
JOL.2.8	Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk everyone in his path: and 
JOL.2.9	They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief.
JOL.2.10	The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining:
JOL.2.11	And the 
JOL.2.12	Therefore also now, says the 
JOL.2.13	And rend 
JOL.2.14	Who knows 
JOL.2.15	Blow the trumpet in Tziyon 
JOL.2.16	Gather the people, sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.
JOL.2.17	Let the priests, the ministers of the

JOL.2.19	Yes, the 
JOL.2.20	But I will remove far off from you the northern 
JOL.2.21	Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the 
JOL.2.22	Be not afraid, you
JOL.2.23	Be glad then, you
JOL.2.24	And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.
JOL.2.25	And I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.
JOL.2.26	And you
JOL.2.27	And you
JOL.2.28	And it shall come to pass afterward, 
JOL.2.29	And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.
JOL.2.30	And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.
JOL.2.31	The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the 
JOL.2.32	And it shall come to pass, 
JOL.3.1	For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Y’hudah 
JOL.3.2	I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Y’hoshafat 
JOL.3.3	And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an prostitute, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.
JOL.3.4	Yes, and what have you
JOL.3.5	Because you
JOL.3.6	The children also of Y’hudah 
JOL.3.7	Behold, I will raise them out of the place to which you
JOL.3.8	And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Y’hudah 
JOL.3.9	Proclaim you
JOL.3.10	Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I 
JOL.3.11	Assemble yourselves, and come, all you
JOL.3.12	Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Y’hoshafat 
JOL.3.13	Put you
JOL.3.14	Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the 
JOL.3.15	The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.
JOL.3.16	The 
JOL.3.17	So shall you
JOL.3.18	And it shall come to pass in that day, 
JOL.3.19	Mitzrayim 
JOL.3.20	But Y’hudah 
JOL.3.21	For I will cleanse their blood 
AMO.1.1	The words of ‘Amos 
AMO.1.2	And he said, The 
AMO.1.3	Thus says the 
AMO.1.4	But I will send a fire into the house of Haza’el 
AMO.1.5	I will break also the bar of Dammesek 
AMO.1.6	Thus says the 
AMO.1.7	But I will send a fire on the wall of ‘Azah 
AMO.1.8	And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod 
AMO.1.9	Thus says the 
AMO.1.10	But I will send a fire on the wall of Tzor 
AMO.1.11	Thus says the 
AMO.1.12	But I will send a fire upon Teman 
AMO.1.13	Thus says the 
AMO.1.14	But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah 
AMO.1.15	And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, says the 
AMO.2.1	Thus says the 
AMO.2.2	But I will send a fire upon Mo’av 
AMO.2.3	And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, says the 
AMO.2.4	Thus says the 
AMO.2.5	But I will send a fire upon Y’hudah 
AMO.2.6	Thus says the 
AMO.2.7	That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the 
AMO.2.8	And they lay 
AMO.2.9	Yet destroyed I the Emori 
AMO.2.10	Also I brought you up from the land of Mitzrayim 
AMO.2.11	And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for N’zirim 
AMO.2.12	But you
AMO.2.13	Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed 
AMO.2.14	Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself:
AMO.2.15	Neither shall he stand that handles the bow; and 
AMO.2.16	And 
AMO.3.1	Hear this word that the 
AMO.3.2	You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.
AMO.3.3	Can two walk together, except they be agreed?
AMO.3.4	Will a lion roar in the forest, when he has no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?
AMO.3.5	Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no trap 
AMO.3.6	Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the 
AMO.3.7	Surely the Lord-Adonai 
AMO.3.8	The lion has roared, who will not fear? the Lord-Adonai 
AMO.3.9	Publish in the palaces at Ashdod 
AMO.3.10	For they know not to do right, says the 
AMO.3.11	Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai 
AMO.3.12	Thus says the 
AMO.3.13	Hear you
AMO.3.14	That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Yisra’el 
AMO.3.15	And I will strike the winter house with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, says the 
AMO.4.1	Hear this word, your
AMO.4.2	The Lord-Adonai 
AMO.4.3	And you
AMO.4.4	Come to Beit-El 
AMO.4.5	And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim 
AMO.4.6	And I also have given you famine in all your cities, and lack of bread in all your places: yet have you
AMO.4.7	And also I have withheld the rain from you, when 
AMO.4.8	So two 
AMO.4.9	I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the palmerworm devoured 
AMO.4.10	I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Mitzrayim 
AMO.4.11	I have overthrown 
AMO.4.12	Therefore thus will I do unto you
AMO.4.13	For, lo, he that forms the mountains, and creates the wind, and declares unto man what 
AMO.5.1	Hear you
AMO.5.2	The virgin of Yisra’el 
AMO.5.3	For thus says the Lord-Adonai 
AMO.5.4	For thus says the 
AMO.5.5	But seek not Beit-El 
AMO.5.6	Seek the 
AMO.5.7	You
AMO.5.9	That strengthens the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.
AMO.5.10	They hate him that rebukes in the gate, and they abhor him that speaks uprightly.
AMO.5.11	Forasmuch therefore as your treading 
AMO.5.12	For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate 
AMO.5.13	Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it 
AMO.5.14	Seek good, and not evil, that you
AMO.5.15	Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the 
AMO.5.16	Therefore the 
AMO.5.17	And in all vineyards 
AMO.5.18	Woe unto you that desire the day of the 
AMO.5.19	As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.
AMO.5.21	I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.
AMO.5.22	Though you
AMO.5.23	Take you
AMO.5.24	But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.
AMO.5.25	Have you
AMO.5.26	But you
AMO.5.27	Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Dammesek 
AMO.6.1	Woe to them 
AMO.6.2	Pass you
AMO.6.3	You
AMO.6.4	That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;
AMO.6.5	That chant to the sound of the viol, 
AMO.6.6	That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Yosef 
AMO.6.7	Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.
AMO.6.8	The Lord-Adonai 
AMO.6.9	And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.
AMO.6.10	And a man’s uncle shall take him up, and he that burns him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that 
AMO.6.11	For, behold, the 
AMO.6.12	Shall horses run upon the rock? will 
AMO.6.13	You
AMO.6.14	But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Yisra’el 
AMO.7.1	Thus has the Lord-Adonai 
AMO.7.2	And it came to pass, 
AMO.7.3	The 
AMO.7.4	Thus has the Lord-Adonai 
AMO.7.5	Then said I, O Lord-Adonai 
AMO.7.6	The 
AMO.7.7	Thus he showed me: and, behold, the Lord-Adonai 
AMO.7.8	And the 
AMO.7.9	And the high places of Yitz’khak 
AMO.7.10	Then Amatzyah 
AMO.7.11	For thus ‘Amos 
AMO.7.12	Also Amatzyah 
AMO.7.13	But prophesy not again any more at Beit-El 
AMO.7.14	Then answered ‘Amos 
AMO.7.15	And the 
AMO.7.16	Now therefore hear you
AMO.7.17	Therefore thus says the 
AMO.8.1	Thus has the Lord-Adonai 
AMO.8.2	And he said, ‘Amos 
AMO.8.3	And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, says the Lord-Adonai 
AMO.8.4	Hear this, O you
AMO.8.5	Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the Shabbat 
AMO.8.6	That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; 
AMO.8.7	The 
AMO.8.8	Shall not the land tremble for this, and everyone mourn that dwells in it? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and drowned, as 
AMO.8.9	And it shall come to pass in that day, says the Lord-Adonai 
AMO.8.10	And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all waist, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only 
AMO.8.11	Behold, the days come, says the Lord-Adonai 
AMO.8.12	And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the 
AMO.8.13	In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.
AMO.8.14	They that swear by the sin of Shomron 
AMO.9.1	I saw the Lord-Adonai 
AMO.9.2	Though they dig into hell, there shall my hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, there will I bring them down:
AMO.9.3	And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel 
AMO.9.4	And though they go into captivity before their enemies, there will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set my eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.
AMO.9.5	And the Lord-Adonai 
AMO.9.8	Behold, the eyes of the Lord-Adonai 
AMO.9.9	For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Yisra’el 
AMO.9.10	All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent 
AMO.9.11	In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David 
AMO.9.12	That they may possess the remnant of Edom 
AMO.9.13	Behold, the days come, says the 
AMO.9.14	And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Yisra’el 
AMO.9.15	And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, says the 
OBA.1.1	The vision of ‘Ovadyah 
OBA.1.2	Behold, I have made you
OBA.1.3	The pride of your
OBA.1.4	Though you
OBA.1.5	If thieves came to you
OBA.1.6	How are 
OBA.1.7	All the men of your

JON.1.1	Now the word of the 
JON.1.2	Arise, go to Nineveh 
JON.1.3	But Yonah 
JON.1.4	But the 
JON.1.5	Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that 
JON.1.6	So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What mean you
JON.1.7	And they said everyone to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil 
JON.1.8	Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray you
JON.1.9	And he said unto them, I 
JON.1.10	Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why have you
JON.1.11	Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto you
JON.1.12	And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest 
JON.1.13	Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring 
JON.1.14	For what reason they cried unto the

JON.1.16	Then the men feared the

JON.2.6	I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars 
JON.2.7	When my soul fainted within me I remembered the

JON.2.9	But I will sacrifice unto you
JON.2.10	And the 
JON.3.1	And the word of the 
JON.3.2	Arise, go unto Nineveh 
JON.3.3	So Yonah 
JON.3.4	And Yonah 
JON.3.5	So the people of Nineveh 
JON.3.6	For word came unto the king of Nineveh 
JON.3.7	And he caused

JON.3.9	Who can tell

JON.4.11	And should not I spare Nineveh 
MIC.1.1	The word of the

MIC.1.3	For, behold, the 
MIC.1.4	And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft 
MIC.1.5	For the transgression of Ya’akov 
MIC.1.6	Therefore I will make Shomron 
MIC.1.7	And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered 
MIC.1.8	Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.
MIC.1.9	For her wound 
MIC.1.10	Declare you
MIC.1.11	Pass you
MIC.1.12	For the inhabitant of Marot 
MIC.1.13	O you
MIC.1.14	Therefore shall you
MIC.1.15	Yet will I bring an heir unto you
MIC.1.16	Make you
MIC.2.1	Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practice it, because it is in the power of their hand.
MIC.2.2	And they covet fields, and take 
MIC.2.3	Therefore thus says the 
MIC.2.4	In that day shall 
MIC.2.5	Therefore you

MIC.2.7	O [you
MIC.2.8	Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: you
MIC.2.9	The women of my people have you
MIC.2.10	Arise you
MIC.2.11	If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, 
MIC.2.12	I will surely assemble, O Ya’akov 
MIC.2.13	The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the 
MIC.3.1	And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Ya’akov 
MIC.3.2	Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;
MIC.3.3	Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay 
MIC.3.4	Then shall they cry unto the

MIC.3.10	They build up Tziyon 
MIC.3.11	The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the 
MIC.3.12	Therefore shall Tziyon 
MIC.4.1	But in the last days it shall come to pass, 
MIC.4.2	And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the

MIC.4.7	And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the 
MIC.4.8	And you
MIC.4.9	Now why do you
MIC.4.10	Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Tziyon 
MIC.4.11	Now also many nations are gathered against you

MIC.5.1	Now gather yourself in troops, O daughter of troops: he has laid siege against us: they shall strike the judge of Yisra’el 
MIC.5.2	But you
MIC.5.3	Therefore will he give them up, until the time 
MIC.5.4	And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the 
MIC.5.5	And this 
MIC.5.6	And they shall waste the land of Ashur 
MIC.5.7	And the remnant of Ya’akov 
MIC.5.8	And the remnant of Ya’akov 
MIC.5.9	You
MIC.5.10	And it shall come to pass in that day, says the 
MIC.5.11	And I will cut off the cities of your
MIC.5.12	And I will cut off witchcrafts out of your
MIC.5.13	Your
MIC.5.14	And I will pluck up your

MIC.6.1	Hear you
MIC.6.2	Hear you
MIC.6.3	O my people, what have I done unto you
MIC.6.4	For I brought you
MIC.6.5	O my people, remember now what Balak

MIC.6.13	Therefore also will I make 
MIC.6.14	you
MIC.6.15	you
MIC.6.16	For the statutes of ‘Omri

NAM.1.1	The burden of Nineveh 
NAM.1.2	God-Elōhīm 
NAM.1.3	The 
NAM.1.4	He rebukes the sea, and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers: Bashan 
NAM.1.5	The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yes, the world, and all that dwell in it.
NAM.1.6	Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.

HAB.1.6	For, lo, I raise up the Kasdim 
HAB.1.7	They 
HAB.1.8	Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle 
HAB.1.9	They shall come all for violence: their faces shall gather together 
HAB.1.10	And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.

ZEP.1.3	I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the land, says the 
ZEP.1.4	I will also stretch out my hand upon Y’hudah 
ZEP.1.5	And them that worship the army of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship 
ZEP.1.6	And them that are turned back from the 
ZEP.1.7	Hold your
ZEP.1.8	And it shall come to pass in the day of the 
ZEP.1.9	In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold, which fill their masters’ houses with violence and deceit.
ZEP.1.10	And it shall come to pass in that day, says the 
ZEP.1.11	Howl, you
ZEP.1.12	And it shall come to pass at that time, 
ZEP.1.13	Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit 
ZEP.1.14	The great day of the 
ZEP.1.15	That day 
ZEP.1.16	A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers.
ZEP.1.17	And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the 
ZEP.1.18	Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the 
ZEP.2.1	Gather yourselves together, yes, gather together, O nation not desired;
ZEP.2.2	Before the decree bring forth, 
ZEP.2.3	Seek you
ZEP.2.4	For ‘Azah 
ZEP.2.5	Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the K’reti 
ZEP.2.6	And the sea coast shall be dwellings 
ZEP.2.7	And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Y’hudah 
ZEP.2.8	I have heard the reproach 
ZEP.2.9	Therefore 
ZEP.2.10	This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified 
ZEP.2.11	The 
ZEP.2.12	You
ZEP.2.13	And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Ashur 
ZEP.2.14	And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the hedgehogs shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; 
ZEP.2.15	This 
ZEP.3.1	Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!
ZEP.3.2	She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the 
ZEP.3.3	Her princes within her 
ZEP.3.4	Her prophets 
ZEP.3.5	The just 
ZEP.3.6	I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passes by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.
ZEP.3.7	I said, Surely you
ZEP.3.8	Therefore wait you
ZEP.3.9	For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the 
ZEP.3.10	From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia 
ZEP.3.11	In that day shall you
ZEP.3.12	I will also leave in the midst of you
ZEP.3.13	The remnant of Yisra’el 
ZEP.3.14	Sing, O daughter of Tziyon 
ZEP.3.15	The 
ZEP.3.16	In that day it shall be said to Yerushalayim 
ZEP.3.17	The 
ZEP.3.18	I will gather 
ZEP.3.19	Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict you
ZEP.3.20	At that time will I bring you 
HAG.1.1	In the second year of Daryavesh 
HAG.1.2	Thus speaks the 
HAG.1.3	Then came the word of the 
HAG.1.5	Now therefore thus says the 
HAG.1.6	You
HAG.1.7	Thus says the 
HAG.1.8	Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, says the 
HAG.1.9	You
HAG.1.10	Therefore the heaven over you is detained 
HAG.1.11	And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the New Wine, and upon the oil, and upon 
HAG.1.12	Then Z’rubavel 
HAG.1.13	Then spoke Hagai 
HAG.1.14	And the 
HAG.1.15	In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Daryavesh 
HAG.2.1	In the seventh 
HAG.2.2	Speak now to Z’rubavel 
HAG.2.3	Who 
HAG.2.4	Yet now be strong, O Z’rubavel 
HAG.2.6	For thus says the 
HAG.2.7	And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with Glory, says the 
HAG.2.8	The silver 
HAG.2.9	The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, says the 
HAG.2.10	In the four and twentieth 
HAG.2.11	Thus says the 
HAG.2.12	If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.
HAG.2.13	Then said Hagai 
HAG.2.14	Then answered Hagai 
HAG.2.15	And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the 
HAG.2.16	Since those 
HAG.2.17	I struck you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands; yet you
HAG.2.18	Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth 
HAG.2.19	Is the seed yet in the barn? yes, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, has not brought forth: from this day will I bless 
HAG.2.20	And again the word of the 
HAG.2.21	Speak to Z’rubavel 
HAG.2.22	And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, everyone by the sword of his brother.
HAG.2.23	In that day, says the 
ZEC.1.1	In the eighth month, in the second year of Daryavesh 
ZEC.1.2	The 
ZEC.1.3	Therefore say you
ZEC.1.4	Be you
ZEC.1.5	Your fathers, where 
ZEC.1.6	But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the 
ZEC.1.7	Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which 
ZEC.1.8	I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that 
ZEC.1.9	Then said I, O my lord, what 
ZEC.1.10	And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These 
ZEC.1.11	And they answered the angel of the 
ZEC.1.12	Then the angel of the 
ZEC.1.13	And the 
ZEC.1.14	So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry you
ZEC.1.15	And I am very sore displeased with the heathen 
ZEC.1.16	Therefore thus says the 
ZEC.1.17	Cry yet, saying, Thus says the 
ZEC.1.18	Then lifted I up my eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.
ZEC.1.19	And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What 
ZEC.1.20	And the 
ZEC.1.21	Then said I, What come these to do? And he spoke, saying, These 
ZEC.2.1	I lifted up my eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.
ZEC.2.2	Then said I, Where go you
ZEC.2.3	And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,
ZEC.2.4	And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Yerushalayim 
ZEC.2.5	For I, says the 
ZEC.2.6	Ho, ho, 
ZEC.2.7	Deliver yourself, O Tziyon 
ZEC.2.8	For thus says the 
ZEC.2.9	For, behold, I will shake my hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil 
ZEC.2.10	Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Tziyon 
ZEC.2.11	And many nations shall be joined to the 
ZEC.2.12	And the 
ZEC.2.13	Be silent, O all flesh, before the 
ZEC.3.1	And he showed me Y’hoshua 
ZEC.3.2	And the 
ZEC.3.3	Now Y’hoshua 
ZEC.3.4	And he answered and spoke unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused your
ZEC.3.5	And I said, Let them set a fair mitre 
ZEC.3.6	And the angel of the 
ZEC.3.7	Thus says the 
ZEC.3.8	Hear now, O Y’hoshua 
ZEC.3.9	For behold the stone that I have laid before Y’hoshua 
ZEC.3.10	In that day, says the 
ZEC.4.1	And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,
ZEC.4.2	And said unto me, What see you
ZEC.4.3	And two olive trees by it, one upon the right 
ZEC.4.4	So I answered and spoke to the angel that talked with me, saying, What 
ZEC.4.5	Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Know you
ZEC.4.6	Then he answered and spoke unto me, saying, This 
ZEC.4.7	Who 
ZEC.4.8	Moreover the word of the 
ZEC.4.9	The hands of Z’rubavel 
ZEC.4.10	For who has despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Z’rubavel 
ZEC.4.11	Then answered I, and said unto him, What 
ZEC.4.12	And I answered again, and said unto him, What 
ZEC.4.13	And he answered me and said, Know you
ZEC.4.14	Then said he, These 
ZEC.5.1	Then I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a flying scroll.
ZEC.5.2	And he said unto me, What see you
ZEC.5.3	Then said he unto me, This 
ZEC.5.4	I will bring it forth, says the 
ZEC.5.5	Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now your
ZEC.5.6	And I said, What 
ZEC.5.7	And, behold, there was lifted up a talent 
ZEC.5.8	And he said, This 
ZEC.5.9	Then lifted I up my eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind 
ZEC.5.10	Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Where do these bear the eifah?
ZEC.5.11	And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shin’ar 
ZEC.6.1	And I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains 
ZEC.6.2	In the first chariot 
ZEC.6.3	And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled and bay horses.
ZEC.6.4	Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What 
ZEC.6.5	And the angel answered and said unto me, These 
ZEC.6.6	The black horses which 
ZEC.6.7	And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.
ZEC.6.8	Then cried he upon me, and spoke unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.
ZEC.6.9	And the word of the 
ZEC.6.10	Take of 
ZEC.6.11	Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set 
ZEC.6.12	And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaks the 
ZEC.6.13	Even he shall build the temple of the 
ZEC.6.14	And the crowns shall be to Helem 
ZEC.6.15	And they 
ZEC.7.1	And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Daryavesh 
ZEC.7.2	When they had sent unto the house of God-Elōhīm 
ZEC.7.4	Then came the word of the 
ZEC.7.5	Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When you
ZEC.7.6	And when you
ZEC.7.8	And the word of the 
ZEC.7.9	Thus speaks the 
ZEC.7.10	And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.
ZEC.7.11	But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.
ZEC.7.12	Yes, they made their hearts 
ZEC.7.13	Therefore it is come to pass, 
ZEC.7.14	But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.
ZEC.8.1	Again the word of the 
ZEC.8.2	Thus says the 
ZEC.8.3	Thus says the 
ZEC.8.4	Thus says the 
ZEC.8.5	And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.
ZEC.8.6	Thus says the 
ZEC.8.7	Thus says the 
ZEC.8.8	And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Yerushalayim 
ZEC.8.9	Thus says the 
ZEC.8.10	For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither 
ZEC.8.11	But now I 
ZEC.8.12	For the seed 
ZEC.8.13	And it shall come to pass, 
ZEC.8.14	For thus says the 
ZEC.8.15	So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Yerushalayim 
ZEC.8.16	These 
ZEC.8.17	And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these 
ZEC.8.18	And the word of the 
ZEC.8.19	Thus says the 
ZEC.8.20	Thus says the 
ZEC.8.21	And the inhabitants of one 
ZEC.8.22	Yes, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the 
ZEC.8.23	Thus says the 
ZEC.9.1	The burden of the word of the 
ZEC.9.2	And Hamat 
ZEC.9.3	And Tzor 
ZEC.9.4	Behold, the Lord-Adonai 
ZEC.9.5	Ashkelon [The Fire of Infamy: I shall be Weighed] shall see 
ZEC.9.6	And a child of incest shall dwell in Ashdod 
ZEC.9.7	And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remains, even he, 
ZEC.9.8	And I will encamp about my house because of the army, because of him that passes by, and because of him that returns: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with my eyes.
ZEC.9.9	Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Tziyon 
ZEC.9.10	And I will cut off the chariot from Efrayim 
ZEC.9.11	As for you
ZEC.9.12	Turn you to the strong hold, you
ZEC.9.13	When I have bent Y’hudah 
ZEC.9.14	And the 
ZEC.9.15	The 
ZEC.9.16	And the 
ZEC.9.17	For how great 
ZEC.10.1	Ask you
ZEC.10.2	For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because 
ZEC.10.3	Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the 
ZEC.10.4	Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together.
ZEC.10.5	And they shall be as mighty 
ZEC.10.6	And I will strengthen the house of Y’hudah 
ZEC.10.7	And 
ZEC.10.8	I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased.
ZEC.10.9	And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again.
ZEC.10.10	I will bring them again also out of the land of Mitzrayim 
ZEC.10.11	And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall strike the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Ashur 
ZEC.10.12	And I will strengthen them in the 
ZEC.11.1	Open your

PSA.9.20	Put them in fear, O 
PSA.10.1	Why stand you
PSA.10.2	The wicked in 
PSA.10.3	For the wicked boasts of his heart’s desire, and blesses the covetous, 
PSA.10.4	The wicked, through the pride of his Countenance 
PSA.10.5	His ways are always grievous; your
PSA.10.6	He has said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for 
PSA.10.7	His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue 
PSA.10.8	He sits in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places does he murder the innocent: his eyes are secretly set against the poor.
PSA.10.9	He lies in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lies in wait to catch the poor: he does catch the poor, when he draws him into his net.
PSA.10.10	He crouches,

PSA.11.3	If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
PSA.11.4	The 
PSA.11.5	The 
PSA.11.6	Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and sulfur, and an horrible tempest: 
PSA.11.7	For the righteous 
PSA.12.1	Help, 
PSA.12.2	They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: 
PSA.12.3	The 
PSA.12.4	Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips 
PSA.12.5	For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, says the 
PSA.12.6	The words of the 
PSA.12.7	you
PSA.12.8	The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.
PSA.13.1	How long will you
PSA.13.2	How long shall I take counsel in my soul, 
PSA.13.3	Consider 
PSA.13.4	Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; 
PSA.13.5	But I have trusted in your
PSA.13.6	I will sing unto the 
PSA.14.1	The fool has said in his heart, 
PSA.14.2	The 
PSA.14.3	They are all gone aside, they are 
PSA.14.4	Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people 
PSA.14.5	There were they in great fear: for God-Elōhīm 
PSA.14.6	You
PSA.14.7	Oh that the salvation of Yisra’el 
PSA.15.1	-Yehōvah 
PSA.15.2	He that walks uprightly, and works righteousness, and speaks the tin his heart.
PSA.15.4	In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honours them that fear the 
PSA.16.1	Preserve me, O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.16.4	Their sorrows shall be multiplied 
PSA.16.5	The 
PSA.16.6	The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant 
PSA.16.7	I will bless the 
PSA.16.8	I have set the 
PSA.16.9	Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices: my flesh also shall rest in hope.
PSA.16.10	For you
PSA.16.11	you
PSA.17.1	Hear the right, O 
PSA.17.2	Let my sentence come forth from your
PSA.17.3	you
PSA.17.4	Concerning the works of men, by the word of your
PSA.17.5	Hold up my goings in your
PSA.17.6	I have called upon you
PSA.17.7	Show your
PSA.17.8	Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of your
PSA.17.9	From the wicked that oppress me, 
PSA.17.10	They are enclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.
PSA.17.11	They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;
PSA.17.12	Like as a lion 
PSA.17.13	Arise, O 
PSA.17.14	From men 
PSA.17.15	As for me, I will behold your
PSA.18.1	I will love you
PSA.18.2	Yehovah Sal’i 
PSA.18.3	I will call upon the 
PSA.18.4	The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.
PSA.18.5	The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.
PSA.18.6	In my distress I called upon the 
PSA.18.7	Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was exceedingly angry.
PSA.18.8	There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
PSA.18.9	He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness 
PSA.18.10	And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.
PSA.18.11	He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him 
PSA.18.12	At the brightness 
PSA.18.13	The 
PSA.18.14	Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and scattered 
PSA.18.15	Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at your
PSA.18.16	He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.
PSA.18.17	He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.
PSA.18.18	They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the 
PSA.18.19	He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
PSA.18.20	The 
PSA.18.21	For I have kept the ways of the 
PSA.18.22	For all his judgments 
PSA.18.23	I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.
PSA.18.24	Therefore has the 
PSA.18.25	With the merciful you
PSA.18.26	With the pure you
PSA.18.27	For you
PSA.18.28	For you
PSA.18.29	For by you
PSA.18.31	For who 
PSA.18.33	He makes my feet like hinds’ 
PSA.18.34	He teaches my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.
PSA.18.35	you
PSA.18.36	you
PSA.18.37	I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.
PSA.18.38	I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.
PSA.18.39	For you
PSA.18.40	you
PSA.18.41	They cried, but 
PSA.18.42	Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.
PSA.18.43	you
PSA.18.44	As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.
PSA.18.45	The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.
PSA.18.46	The 
PSA.18.48	He delivers me from mine enemies: yea, you
PSA.18.49	Therefore will I give thanks unto you
PSA.18.50	Great deliverance gives he to his king; and shows mercy to his anointed, to David 
PSA.19.1	The heavens declare the glory of God-Elōhīm 
PSA.19.2	Day unto day utters speech, and night unto night shows knowledge.
PSA.19.4	Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them has he set a tabernacle for the sun,
PSA.19.5	Which 
PSA.19.6	His going forth 
PSA.19.7	The law of the 
PSA.19.8	The statutes of the 
PSA.19.9	The fear of the 
PSA.19.10	More to be desired 
PSA.19.11	Moreover by them is your
PSA.19.12	Who can understand 
PSA.19.13	Keep back your
PSA.19.14	Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in your
PSA.20.1	The 
PSA.20.2	Send you
PSA.20.3	Remember all your
PSA.20.4	Grant you
PSA.20.5	We will rejoice in your
PSA.20.6	Now know I that the 
PSA.20.7	Some 
PSA.20.8	They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.
PSA.20.9	Save, 
PSA.21.1	The king shall joy in your
PSA.21.2	you
PSA.21.3	For you
PSA.21.4	He asked life of you
PSA.21.5	His glory 
PSA.21.6	For you
PSA.21.7	For the king trusts in the 
PSA.21.8	Your
PSA.21.9	you
PSA.21.10	Their fruit shall you
PSA.21.11	For they intended evil against you
PSA.21.12	Therefore shall you
PSA.21.13	Be you
PSA.22.1	My God-Elōhīm 
PSA.22.2	O my God-Elōhīm 
PSA.22.3	But you
PSA.22.4	Our fathers trusted in you
PSA.22.5	They cried unto you
PSA.22.6	But I 
PSA.22.7	All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, 
PSA.22.8	He trusted on the 
PSA.22.9	But you
PSA.22.10	I was cast upon you
PSA.22.11	Be not far from me; for trouble 
PSA.22.12	Many bulls have compassed me: strong 
PSA.22.13	They gaped upon me 
PSA.22.14	I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like grow 
PSA.22.15	My strength is dried up like a potsherd 
PSA.22.16	For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.
PSA.22.17	I may tell all my bones: they look 
PSA.22.18	They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.
PSA.22.19	But be not you
PSA.22.20	Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.
PSA.22.21	Save me from the lion’s mouth: for you
PSA.22.22	I will declare your
PSA.22.23	You
PSA.22.24	For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither has he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.
PSA.22.25	My praise 
PSA.22.26	The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the 
PSA.22.27	All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the

PSA.22.31	They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he has done 
PSA.23.1	Yehovah Ro’i 
PSA.23.2	He makes me to lie down in green pastures: he leads me beside the still waters.
PSA.23.3	He restores my soul: he leads me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.
PSA.23.4	Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for you
PSA.23.5	you
PSA.23.6	Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the 
PSA.24.1	The earth 
PSA.24.2	For he has founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.
PSA.24.3	Who shall ascend into the hill of the 
PSA.24.4	He that has clean hands, and a pure heart; who has not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.
PSA.24.5	He shall receive the blessing from the 
PSA.24.6	This 
PSA.24.7	Lift up your heads, O you
PSA.24.8	Who 
PSA.24.9	Lift up your heads, O you

PSA.25.7	Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to your
PSA.25.8	Good and upright

PSA.25.13	His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.
PSA.25.14	The secret of the 
PSA.25.15	Mine eyes 
PSA.25.16	Turn you
PSA.25.17	The troubles of my heart are enlarged: 
PSA.25.18	Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.
PSA.25.19	Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.
PSA.25.20	O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in you
PSA.25.21	Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on you
PSA.25.22	Redeem Yisra’el 
PSA.26.1	Judge me, O 
PSA.26.2	Examine me, O 
PSA.26.3	For your
PSA.26.4	I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.
PSA.26.5	I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.
PSA.26.6	I will wash mine hands in innocence: so will I compass 
PSA.26.7	That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all your
PSA.26.8	-Yehōvah 
PSA.26.9	Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:
PSA.26.10	In whose hands 
PSA.26.11	But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.

PSA.28.2	Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto you
PSA.28.3	Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief 
PSA.28.4	Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert.
PSA.28.5	Because they regard not the works of the

PSA.31.11	I was a reproach 
PSA.31.12	I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.

PSA.34.6	This poor man cried, and the 
PSA.34.7	The angel of the 
PSA.34.8	O taste and see that the 
PSA.34.9	O fear the 
PSA.34.10	The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the

PSA.35.2	Take hold of shield and buckler 
PSA.35.3	Draw out also the spear, and stop 
PSA.35.4	Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.
PSA.35.5	Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the 
PSA.35.6	Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the 
PSA.35.7	For without cause have they hid for me their net 
PSA.35.8	Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he has hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.
PSA.35.9	And my soul shall be joyful in the 
PSA.35.10	All my bones shall say, 
PSA.35.11	False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge

PSA.35.15	But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: 
PSA.35.16	With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.
PSA.35.17	Lord-Adonai 
PSA.35.18	I will give you
PSA.35.19	Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: 
PSA.35.20	For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against 
PSA.35.21	Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, 
PSA.35.23	Stir up yourself, and awake to my judgment, 
PSA.35.24	Judge me, O 
PSA.35.25	Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallow (to approve, commend, accept)ed him up.
PSA.35.26	Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify 
PSA.35.27	Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the 
PSA.35.28	And my tongue shall speak of your
PSA.36.1	The transgression of the wicked says within my heart, 
PSA.36.2	For he flatters himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.
PSA.36.3	The words of his mouth 
PSA.36.4	He devises mischief upon his bed; he sets himself in a way 
PSA.36.5	Your
PSA.36.6	Your
PSA.36.7	How excellent 
PSA.36.8	They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of your
PSA.36.9	For with you
PSA.36.10	O continue your
PSA.36.11	Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.
PSA.36.12	There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.
PSA.37.1	Be troubled 
PSA.37.2	For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.
PSA.37.3	Trust in the 
PSA.37.4	Delight yourself also in the 
PSA.37.5	Commit your
PSA.37.6	And he shall bring forth your
PSA.37.7	Rest in the 
PSA.37.8	Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: be troubled 
PSA.37.9	For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the 
PSA.37.10	For yet a little while, and the wicked 
PSA.37.11	But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
PSA.37.12	The wicked plots against the just, and gnashes upon him with his teeth.
PSA.37.13	The Lord-Adonai 
PSA.37.14	The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, 
PSA.37.15	Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.
PSA.37.16	A little that a righteous man has 
PSA.37.17	For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the 
PSA.37.18	The 
PSA.37.19	They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
PSA.37.20	But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the 
PSA.37.21	The wicked borrows, and pays not again: but the righteous shows mercy, and gives.
PSA.37.22	For 
PSA.37.23	The steps of a 
PSA.37.24	Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the 
PSA.37.25	I have been young, and 
PSA.37.27	Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell forevermore.
PSA.37.28	For the 
PSA.37.29	The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein forever.
PSA.37.30	The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom, and his tongue talks of judgment.
PSA.37.31	The law of his God-Elōhīm 
PSA.37.32	The wicked watches the righteous, and seeks to slay him.
PSA.37.33	The 
PSA.37.34	Wait on the 
PSA.37.35	I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.
PSA.37.36	Yet he passed away, and, lo, he 
PSA.37.37	Mark the perfect 
PSA.37.38	But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.
PSA.37.39	But the salvation of the righteous 
PSA.37.40	And the 
PSA.38.1	O 
PSA.38.2	For your
PSA.38.4	For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
PSA.38.5	My wounds stink 
PSA.38.6	I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.
PSA.38.7	For my loins 
PSA.38.8	I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.
PSA.38.9	Lord-Adonai 
PSA.38.10	My heart pants, my strength fails me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.
PSA.38.11	My lovers and my friends stand aloof 
PSA.38.12	They also that seek after my life lay snares 
PSA.38.13	But I, as a deaf 
PSA.38.14	Thus I was as a man that hears not, and in whose mouth 
PSA.38.15	For in you
PSA.38.16	For I said, 
PSA.38.17	For I 
PSA.38.18	For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.
PSA.38.19	But mine enemies 
PSA.38.20	They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow 
PSA.38.21	Forsake me not, O 
PSA.38.22	Make haste to help me, O Lord-Adonai 
PSA.39.1	I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.
PSA.39.2	I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, 
PSA.39.3	My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: 
PSA.39.4	-Yehōvah 
PSA.39.5	Behold, you
PSA.39.6	Surely every man walks in a vain show: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heaps up 
PSA.39.7	And now, Lord-Adonai 
PSA.39.8	Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach 
PSA.39.9	I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because you
PSA.39.10	Remove your
PSA.39.11	When you
PSA.39.12	Hear my prayer, O 
PSA.39.13	O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.
PSA.40.1	I waited patiently for the 
PSA.40.2	He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, 
PSA.40.3	And he has put a new song in my mouth, 
PSA.40.4	Blessed 
PSA.40.5	Many, O 
PSA.40.6	Sacrifice and offering you
PSA.40.7	Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book 
PSA.40.8	I delight to do you
PSA.40.9	I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O 
PSA.40.10	I have not hid your
PSA.40.11	Withhold not you
PSA.40.12	For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart fails me.
PSA.40.13	Be pleased, O 
PSA.40.14	Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.
PSA.40.15	Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.
PSA.40.16	Let all those that seek you
PSA.40.17	But I 
PSA.41.1	Blessed 
PSA.41.2	The 
PSA.41.3	The 
PSA.41.4	I said, 
PSA.41.5	Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?
PSA.41.6	And if he come to see 
PSA.41.7	All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.
PSA.41.8	An evil disease, 
PSA.41.9	Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, has lifted up 
PSA.41.10	But you
PSA.41.11	By this I know that you
PSA.41.12	And as for me, you
PSA.41.13	Blessed 
PSA.42.1	As the deer pants after the water brooks, so pants my soul after you
PSA.42.2	My soul thirsts for God-Elōhīm 
PSA.42.3	My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where 
PSA.42.4	When I remember these 
PSA.42.5	Why are you
PSA.42.6	O my God-Elōhīm 
PSA.42.7	Deep calls unto deep at the noise of your
PSA.42.9	I will say unto God-El Sal’i 
PSA.42.11	Why are you
PSA.43.1	Judge me, O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.43.2	For you
PSA.43.3	O send out your
PSA.43.4	Then will I go unto the altar of God-El 
PSA.43.5	Why are you
PSA.44.1	We have heard with our ears, O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.44.3	For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but your
PSA.44.4	you
PSA.44.5	Through you
PSA.44.6	For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.
PSA.44.7	But you
PSA.44.8	In God-Elōhīm 
PSA.44.9	But you
PSA.44.10	you
PSA.44.11	you
PSA.44.12	you
PSA.44.13	you
PSA.44.14	you
PSA.44.15	My confusion 
PSA.44.16	For the voice of him that reproaches and blasphemes; by reason of the enemy and avenger.
PSA.44.17	All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten you
PSA.44.18	Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from your
PSA.44.19	Though you
PSA.44.20	If we have forgotten the name of our God-Elōhīm 
PSA.44.21	Shall not God-Elōhīm 
PSA.44.22	Yea, for your
PSA.44.23	Awake, why sleep you
PSA.44.24	For what reason hide you
PSA.44.25	For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaves unto the earth.
PSA.44.26	Arise for our help, and redeem us for your
PSA.45.1	My heart is indicting a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue 
PSA.45.2	you
PSA.45.3	Gird your
PSA.45.4	And in your
PSA.45.5	You
PSA.45.6	Your
PSA.45.7	your
PSA.45.8	All your
PSA.45.9	Kings’ daughters 
PSA.45.10	Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline your
PSA.45.11	So shall the king greatly desire your
PSA.45.12	And the daughter of Tzor 
PSA.45.13	The king’s daughter 
PSA.45.14	She shall be brought unto the king in clothing of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto you
PSA.45.15	With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king’s palace.
PSA.45.16	Instead of your
PSA.45.17	I will make your
PSA.46.1	God-Elōhīm 
PSA.46.2	Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;
PSA.46.5	God-Elōhīm 
PSA.46.6	The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.
PSA.46.7	The 
PSA.46.8	Come, behold the works of the 
PSA.46.9	He makes wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaks the bow, and cut the spear in sunder; he burns the chariot in the fire.
PSA.46.10	Be still, and know that I 
PSA.46.11	The 
PSA.47.1	O clap your hands, all you
PSA.47.2	For the 
PSA.47.3	He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet.
PSA.47.4	He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Ya’akov 
PSA.47.5	God-Elōhīm 
PSA.47.6	Sing praises to God-Elōhīm 
PSA.47.7	For God-Elōhīm 
PSA.47.8	God-Elōhīm 
PSA.47.9	The princes of the people are gathered together, 
PSA.48.1	Great 
PSA.48.2	Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, 
PSA.48.3	God-Elōhīm 
PSA.48.4	For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.
PSA.48.5	They saw 
PSA.48.6	Fear took hold upon them there, 
PSA.48.7	you
PSA.48.8	As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the 
PSA.48.9	We have thought of your
PSA.48.10	According to your
PSA.48.11	Let mount Tziyon 
PSA.48.12	Walk about Tziyon 
PSA.48.13	Mark you
PSA.48.14	For this God-Elōhīm 
PSA.49.1	Hear this, all 
PSA.49.2	Both low and high, rich and poor, together.
PSA.49.3	My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart 
PSA.49.4	I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.
PSA.49.5	For what reason should I fear in the days of evil, 
PSA.49.6	They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;
PSA.49.7	None 
PSA.49.8	(For the redemption of their soul 
PSA.49.9	That he should still live forever, 
PSA.49.10	For he sees 
PSA.49.11	Their inward thought 
PSA.49.12	Nevertheless man 
PSA.49.13	This their way 
PSA.49.14	Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.
PSA.49.15	But God-Elōhīm 
PSA.49.16	Be not you
PSA.49.17	For when he dies he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.
PSA.49.18	Though while he lived he Blessed 
PSA.49.19	He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.
PSA.49.20	Man 
PSA.50.1	The mighty God-Elōhīm 
PSA.50.2	Out of Tziyon 
PSA.50.3	Our God-Elōhīm 
PSA.50.4	He shall call to 
PSA.50.5	Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.
PSA.50.6	And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God-Elōhīm 
PSA.50.7	Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Yisra’el 
PSA.50.8	I will not reprove you
PSA.50.9	I will take no bullock out of your
PSA.50.10	For every beast of the forest 
PSA.50.11	I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field 
PSA.50.12	If I were hungry, I would not tell you
PSA.50.13	Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?
PSA.50.14	Offer unto God-Elōhīm 
PSA.50.15	And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver you
PSA.50.16	But unto the wicked God-Elōhīm 
PSA.50.17	Seeing you
PSA.50.18	When you

PSA.51.1	Have mercy upon me, O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.51.2	Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
PSA.51.3	For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin 
PSA.51.4	Against you
PSA.51.5	Behold, I was shaped in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.
PSA.51.6	Behold, you
PSA.51.7	Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
PSA.51.8	Make me to hear joy and gladness; 
PSA.51.9	Hide your
PSA.51.10	Create in me a clean heart, O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.51.11	Cast me not away from your
PSA.51.12	Restore unto me the joy of your
PSA.51.14	Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.51.15	O Lord-Adonai 
PSA.51.16	For you
PSA.51.17	The sacrifices of God-Elōhīm 
PSA.51.18	Do good in your
PSA.51.19	Then shall you
PSA.52.1	Why boast you
PSA.52.2	Your
PSA.52.3	you
PSA.52.4	you
PSA.52.5	God-Elōhīm 
PSA.52.6	The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:
PSA.52.7	Lo, 
PSA.52.8	But I 
PSA.52.9	I will praise you
PSA.53.1	The fool has said in his heart, 
PSA.53.2	God-Elōhīm 
PSA.53.3	Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; 
PSA.53.4	Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people 
PSA.53.5	There were they in great fear, 
PSA.53.6	Oh that the salvation of Yisra’el 
PSA.54.1	Save me, O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.54.2	Hear my prayer, O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.54.3	For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God-Elōhīm 
PSA.54.4	Behold, God-Elōhīm 
PSA.54.5	He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in your
PSA.54.6	I will freely sacrifice unto you
PSA.54.7	For he has delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye has seen 
PSA.55.1	Give ear to my prayer, O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.55.2	Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;
PSA.55.3	Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.
PSA.55.4	My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.
PSA.55.5	Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror has overwhelmed me.
PSA.55.6	And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! 
PSA.55.7	Lo, 
PSA.55.8	I would hasten my escape from the windy storm 
PSA.55.9	Destroy, O Lord-Adonai 
PSA.55.10	Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow 
PSA.55.11	Wickedness 
PSA.55.12	For 
PSA.55.13	But 
PSA.55.14	We took sweet counsel together, 
PSA.55.15	Let death seize upon them, 
PSA.55.16	As for me, I will call upon God-Elōhīm 
PSA.55.17	Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.
PSA.55.18	He has delivered my soul in peace from the battle 
PSA.55.19	God-Elōhīm 
PSA.55.20	He has put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he has broken his covenant.
PSA.55.22	Cast your
PSA.55.23	But you
PSA.56.1	Be merciful unto me, O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.56.2	Mine enemies would daily swallow 
PSA.56.3	What time I am afraid, I will trust in you
PSA.56.4	In God-Elōhīm 
PSA.56.5	Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts 
PSA.56.6	They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.
PSA.56.7	Shall they escape by iniquity? in 
PSA.56.8	you
PSA.56.9	When I cry 
PSA.56.10	In God-Elōhīm 
PSA.56.11	In God-Elōhīm 
PSA.56.12	Your
PSA.56.13	For you
PSA.57.1	Be merciful unto me, O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.57.2	I will cry unto God-Elōhīm 
PSA.57.3	He shall send from heaven, and save me 
PSA.57.4	My soul 
PSA.57.5	Be you
PSA.57.6	They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen 
PSA.57.7	My heart is fixed, O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.57.8	Awake up, my glory; awake, Psaltery 
PSA.57.9	I will praise you
PSA.57.10	For your
PSA.57.11	Be you
PSA.58.1	Do you
PSA.58.2	Yea, in heart your
PSA.58.3	The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.
PSA.58.4	Their poison 
PSA.58.5	Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.
PSA.58.6	Break their teeth, O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.58.7	Let them melt away as waters 
PSA.58.8	As a snail 
PSA.58.9	Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in 
PSA.58.10	The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
PSA.58.11	So that a man shall say, Truly 
PSA.59.1	Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God-Elōhīm 
PSA.59.2	Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.
PSA.59.3	For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not 
PSA.59.4	They run and prepare themselves without 
PSA.59.5	you
PSA.59.6	They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.
PSA.59.7	Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords 
PSA.59.8	But you
PSA.59.10	The God-Elohe Khasdi 
PSA.59.11	Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by your
PSA.59.13	Consume 
PSA.59.14	And at evening let them return; 
PSA.59.15	Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.
PSA.59.16	But I will sing of your
PSA.59.17	Unto you
PSA.60.1	O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.60.2	you
PSA.60.3	you
PSA.60.4	you
PSA.60.5	That your
PSA.60.6	God-Elōhīm 
PSA.60.7	Gil’ad 
PSA.60.8	Mo’av 
PSA.60.9	Who will bring me 
PSA.60.11	Give us help from trouble: for vain 
PSA.60.12	Through God-Elōhīm 
PSA.61.1	Hear my cry, O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.61.2	From the end of the earth will I cry unto you
PSA.61.3	For you
PSA.61.4	I will abide in your
PSA.61.5	For you
PSA.61.6	you
PSA.61.7	He shall abide before God-Elōhīm 
PSA.61.8	So will I sing praise unto your
PSA.62.1	Truly my soul waits upon God-Elōhīm 
PSA.62.2	He only 
PSA.62.3	How long will you
PSA.62.4	They only consult to cast 
PSA.62.5	My soul, wait you
PSA.62.6	He only 
PSA.62.7	In God-Elōhīm 
PSA.62.8	Trust in him at all times; 
PSA.62.9	Surely men of low degree 
PSA.62.10	Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart 
PSA.62.11	God-Elōhīm 
PSA.62.12	Also unto you
PSA.63.1	O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.63.2	To see your
PSA.63.3	Because your
PSA.63.4	Thus will I bless you
PSA.63.5	My soul shall be satisfied as 
PSA.63.6	When I remember you
PSA.63.7	Because you
PSA.63.8	My soul follows hard after you
PSA.63.9	But those 
PSA.63.10	They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.
PSA.63.11	But the king shall rejoice in God-Elōhīm 
PSA.64.1	Hear my voice, O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.64.2	Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:
PSA.64.3	Who whet their tongue like a sword, 
PSA.64.4	That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.
PSA.64.5	They encourage themselves 
PSA.64.6	They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward 
PSA.64.7	But God-Elōhīm 
PSA.64.8	So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.
PSA.64.9	And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God-Elōhīm 
PSA.64.10	The righteous shall be glad in the 
PSA.65.1	Praise waits for you
PSA.65.2	O you
PSA.65.3	Iniquities prevail against me: 
PSA.65.4	Blessed 
PSA.65.6	Which by his strength sets fast the mountains; 
PSA.65.7	Which stills the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.
PSA.65.8	They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at your
PSA.65.9	you
PSA.65.10	you
PSA.65.11	you
PSA.65.12	They drop 
PSA.65.13	The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.
PSA.66.1	Make a joyful noise unto God-Elōhīm 
PSA.66.2	Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.
PSA.66.3	Say unto God-Elōhīm 
PSA.66.4	All the earth shall worship you
PSA.66.5	Come and see the works of God-Elōhīm 
PSA.66.6	He turned the sea into dry 
PSA.66.7	He rules by his power forever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah 
PSA.66.8	O bless our God-Elōhīm 
PSA.66.9	Which holds our soul in life, and suffers not our feet to be moved.
PSA.66.10	For you
PSA.66.11	you
PSA.66.12	you
PSA.66.13	I will go into your
PSA.66.14	Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth has spoken, when I was in trouble.
PSA.66.15	I will offer unto you
PSA.66.16	Come 
PSA.66.17	I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.
PSA.66.18	If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord-Adonai 
PSA.66.20	Blessed 
PSA.67.1	God-Elōhīm 
PSA.67.2	That you
PSA.67.3	Let the people praise you
PSA.67.4	O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for you
PSA.67.5	Let the people praise you
PSA.67.7	God-Elōhīm 
PSA.68.1	Let God-Elōhīm 
PSA.68.2	As smoke is driven away, 
PSA.68.3	But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God-Elōhīm 
PSA.68.4	Sing unto God-Elōhīm 
PSA.68.5	A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, 
PSA.68.6	God-Elōhīm 
PSA.68.7	O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.68.8	The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God-Elōhīm 
PSA.68.9	you
PSA.68.10	Your
PSA.68.11	The Lord-Adonai 
PSA.68.12	Kings of armies did flee apace 
PSA.68.13	Though you
PSA.68.14	When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was 
PSA.68.15	The hill of God-Elōhīm 
PSA.68.16	Why leap you
PSA.68.17	The chariots of God-Elōhīm 
PSA.68.18	you
PSA.68.19	Blessed 
PSA.68.21	But God-Elōhīm 
PSA.68.22	The Lord-Adonai 
PSA.68.23	That your
PSA.68.24	They have seen your
PSA.68.25	The singers went before, the players on instruments 
PSA.68.26	Bless you
PSA.68.27	There 
PSA.68.28	Your
PSA.68.29	Because of your
PSA.68.30	Rebuke 
PSA.68.31	Princes shall come out of Mitzrayim 
PSA.68.32	Sing unto God-Elōhīm 
PSA.68.33	To him that rides upon the heavens of heavens, 
PSA.68.34	Ascribe you
PSA.68.35	O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.69.1	Save me, O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.69.2	I sink in deep mire, where 
PSA.69.3	I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God-Elōhīm 
PSA.69.4	They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, 
PSA.69.5	O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.69.6	Let not them that wait on you
PSA.69.7	Because for your
PSA.69.8	I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother’s children.
PSA.69.9	For the zeal of your
PSA.69.10	When I wept, 
PSA.69.11	I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.
PSA.69.12	They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I 
PSA.69.13	But as for me, my prayer 
PSA.69.14	Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
PSA.69.15	Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow 
PSA.69.16	Hear me, O 
PSA.69.17	And hide not your
PSA.69.18	Draw near unto my soul, 
PSA.69.19	you
PSA.69.20	Reproach 
PSA.69.21	They gave me also gall 
PSA.69.22	Let their table become a snare before them: and 
PSA.69.23	Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins 
PSA.69.24	Pour out your
PSA.69.25	Let their habitation be desolate; 
PSA.69.26	For they persecute 
PSA.69.27	Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into your
PSA.69.28	Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.
PSA.69.29	But I 
PSA.69.30	I will praise the name of God-Elōhīm 
PSA.69.32	The humble shall see 
PSA.69.33	For the 
PSA.69.34	Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and everything that moves therein.
PSA.69.35	For God-Elōhīm 
PSA.69.36	The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.
PSA.70.2	Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.
PSA.70.3	Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.
PSA.70.4	Let all those that seek you
PSA.70.5	But I 
PSA.71.1	In you
PSA.71.2	Deliver me in your
PSA.71.3	Be you
PSA.71.4	Deliver me, O my God-Elōhīm 
PSA.71.5	For you
PSA.71.6	By you
PSA.71.7	I am as a wonder unto many; but you
PSA.71.8	Let my mouth be filled 
PSA.71.9	Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength fails.
PSA.71.10	For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,
PSA.71.11	Saying, God-Elōhīm 
PSA.71.12	O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.71.13	Let them be confounded 
PSA.71.14	But I will hope continually, and will yet praise you
PSA.71.15	My mouth shall show forth your
PSA.71.16	I will go in the strength of the Lord-Adonai 
PSA.71.17	O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.71.18	Now also when I am old and grayheaded, O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.71.19	Your
PSA.71.21	you
PSA.71.22	I will also praise you
PSA.71.23	My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto you
PSA.71.24	My tongue also shall talk of your
PSA.72.1	Give the king your
PSA.72.2	He shall judge your
PSA.72.3	The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.
PSA.72.4	He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.
PSA.72.5	They shall fear you
PSA.72.6	He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers 
PSA.72.7	In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endures.
PSA.72.8	He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.
PSA.72.9	They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.
PSA.72.10	The kings of Tarshish 
PSA.72.11	Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.
PSA.72.12	For he shall deliver the needy when he cries; the poor also, and 
PSA.72.13	He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.
PSA.72.14	He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.
PSA.72.15	And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheva 
PSA.72.16	There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like L’vanon 
PSA.72.17	His name shall endure forever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and 
PSA.72.18	Blessed 
PSA.72.19	And Blessed 
PSA.72.20	The prayers of David 
PSA.73.1	Truly God-Elōhīm 
PSA.73.2	But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well near slipped.
PSA.73.3	For I was envious at the foolish, 
PSA.73.4	For 
PSA.73.5	They 
PSA.73.6	Therefore pride compasses them about as a chain; violence covers them 
PSA.73.7	Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.
PSA.73.8	They are corrupt, and speak wickedly 
PSA.73.9	They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walks through the earth.
PSA.73.10	Therefore his people return here: and waters of a full 
PSA.73.11	And they say, How does God-Elōhīm 
PSA.73.12	Behold, these 
PSA.73.13	Truly I have cleansed my heart 
PSA.73.14	For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.
PSA.73.15	If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend 
PSA.73.16	When I thought to know this, it 
PSA.73.17	Until I went into the sanctuary of God-Elōhīm 
PSA.73.18	Surely you
PSA.73.19	How are they 
PSA.73.20	As a dream when 
PSA.73.21	Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins 
PSA.73.22	So foolish 
PSA.73.23	Nevertheless I 
PSA.73.24	you
PSA.73.25	Whom have I in heaven 
PSA.73.26	My flesh and my heart fails: 
PSA.73.27	For, lo, they that are far from you
PSA.73.28	But 
PSA.74.1	O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.74.2	Remember your
PSA.74.3	Lift up your
PSA.74.4	Your
PSA.74.6	But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.
PSA.74.7	They have cast fire into your
PSA.74.8	They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God-Elōhīm 
PSA.74.9	We see not our signs: 
PSA.74.10	O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.74.11	Why withdraw you
PSA.74.12	For God-Elōhīm 
PSA.74.13	you
PSA.74.14	you
PSA.74.15	you
PSA.74.16	The day 
PSA.74.17	you
PSA.74.18	Remember this, 
PSA.74.19	O deliver not the soul of your
PSA.74.20	Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.
PSA.74.21	O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise your
PSA.74.22	Arise, O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.74.23	Forget not the voice of your
PSA.75.1	Unto you
PSA.75.2	When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.
PSA.75.3	The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah 
PSA.75.4	I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:
PSA.75.5	Lift not up your horn on high: speak 
PSA.75.6	For promotion 
PSA.75.7	But God-Elōhīm 
PSA.75.8	For in the hand of the 
PSA.75.9	But I will declare forever; I will sing praises to the God-Elōhīm 
PSA.75.10	All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; 
PSA.76.1	In Y’hudah 
PSA.76.2	In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Tziyon 
PSA.76.3	There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah 
PSA.76.4	you
PSA.76.5	The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.
PSA.76.6	At your
PSA.76.7	you
PSA.76.8	you
PSA.76.9	When God-Elōhīm 
PSA.76.10	Surely the wrath of man shall praise you
PSA.76.11	Vow, and pay unto the 
PSA.76.12	He shall cut off the spirit of princes: 
PSA.77.1	I cried unto God-Elōhīm 
PSA.77.2	In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord-Adonai 
PSA.77.3	I remembered God-Elōhīm 
PSA.77.4	you
PSA.77.5	I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
PSA.77.6	I call to 
PSA.77.7	Will the Lord-Adonai 
PSA.77.8	Is his mercy clean gone forever? does 
PSA.77.9	Hath God-Elōhīm 
PSA.77.10	And I said, This 
PSA.77.11	I will remember the works of the 
PSA.77.12	I will meditate also of all your
PSA.77.13	Your
PSA.77.14	you
PSA.77.15	you
PSA.77.16	The waters saw you
PSA.77.17	The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: your
PSA.77.18	The voice of your
PSA.77.19	Your
PSA.77.20	you
PSA.78.1	Give ear, O my people, 
PSA.78.2	I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:
PSA.78.3	Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
PSA.78.4	We will not hide 
PSA.78.5	For he established a testimony in Ya’akov 
PSA.78.6	That the generation to come might know 
PSA.78.7	That they might set their hope in God-Elōhīm 
PSA.78.8	And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation 
PSA.78.9	The children of Efrayim 
PSA.78.10	They kept not the covenant of God-Elōhīm 
PSA.78.11	And forgot his works, and his wonders that he had showed them.
PSA.78.12	Marvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Mitzrayim 
PSA.78.13	He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.
PSA.78.14	In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
PSA.78.15	He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave 
PSA.78.16	He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
PSA.78.17	And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
PSA.78.18	And they tempted God-Elōhīm 
PSA.78.19	Yea, they spoke against God-Elōhīm 
PSA.78.20	Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?
PSA.78.21	Therefore the 
PSA.78.22	Because they believed not in God-Elōhīm 
PSA.78.23	Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
PSA.78.24	And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.
PSA.78.25	Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.
PSA.78.26	He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.
PSA.78.27	He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
PSA.78.28	And he let 
PSA.78.29	So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;
PSA.78.30	They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat 
PSA.78.31	The wrath of God-Elōhīm 
PSA.78.32	For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
PSA.78.33	Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.
PSA.78.34	When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God-Elōhīm 
PSA.78.35	And they remembered that God-Elōhīm 
PSA.78.36	Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
PSA.78.37	For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant.
PSA.78.38	But he, 
PSA.78.39	For he remembered that they 
PSA.78.40	How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, 
PSA.78.41	Yea, they turned back and tempted God-Elōhīm 
PSA.78.42	They remembered not his hand, 
PSA.78.43	How he had wrought his signs in Mitzrayim 
PSA.78.44	And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
PSA.78.45	He sent diverse sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
PSA.78.46	He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, and their labour unto the locust.
PSA.78.47	He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost.
PSA.78.48	He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
PSA.78.49	He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels 
PSA.78.50	He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
PSA.78.51	And smote all the firstborn in Mitzrayim 
PSA.78.52	But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
PSA.78.53	And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
PSA.78.54	And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, 
PSA.78.55	He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Yisra’el 
PSA.78.56	Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God-El ‘Elyon 
PSA.78.57	But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
PSA.78.58	For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
PSA.78.59	When God-Elōhīm 
PSA.78.60	So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh 
PSA.78.61	And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand.
PSA.78.62	He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was exceedingly angry with his inheritance.
PSA.78.63	The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
PSA.78.64	Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
PSA.78.65	Then the Lord-Adonai 
PSA.78.66	And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach 
PSA.78.67	Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Yosef 
PSA.78.68	But chose the tribe of Y’hudah 
PSA.78.69	And he built his sanctuary like high 
PSA.78.70	He chose David 
PSA.78.71	From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Ya’akov 
PSA.78.72	So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.
PSA.79.1	O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.79.2	The dead bodies of your
PSA.79.3	Their blood have they shed like water round about Yerushalayim 
PSA.79.4	We are become a reproach 
PSA.79.5	How long, 
PSA.79.6	Pour out your
PSA.79.7	For they have devoured Ya’akov 
PSA.79.8	O remember not against us former iniquities: let your
PSA.79.9	Help us, O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.79.10	For what reason should the heathen say, Where 
PSA.79.11	Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you
PSA.79.12	And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach 
PSA.79.13	So we your
PSA.80.1	Give ear, O Shepherd of Yisra’el 
PSA.80.2	Before Efrayim 
PSA.80.3	Turn us again, O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.80.4	O 
PSA.80.5	you
PSA.80.6	you
PSA.80.7	Turn us again, O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.80.8	you
PSA.80.9	you
PSA.80.10	The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof 
PSA.80.11	She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.
PSA.80.12	Why have you
PSA.80.13	The boar out of the wood does waste it, and the wild beast of the field does devour it.
PSA.80.14	Return, we beseech 
PSA.80.15	And the vineyard which your
PSA.80.17	Let your
PSA.80.18	So will not we go back from you
PSA.80.19	Turn us again, O 
PSA.81.1	Sing aloud unto God-Elōhīm 
PSA.81.2	Take a Psalm 
PSA.81.3	Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.
PSA.81.4	For this a statute for Yisra’el 
PSA.81.5	This he ordained in Yosef 
PSA.81.6	I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.
PSA.81.7	you
PSA.81.8	Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto you
PSA.81.9	There shall no strange god be in you
PSA.81.10	I 
PSA.81.11	But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Yisra’el 
PSA.81.12	So I gave them up unto their own hearts’ lust: 
PSA.81.13	Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, 
PSA.81.14	I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.
PSA.81.15	The haters of the 
PSA.81.16	He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied you
PSA.82.1	God-Elōhīm 
PSA.82.2	How long will you
PSA.82.3	Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.
PSA.82.4	Deliver the poor and needy: rid 
PSA.82.5	They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.
PSA.82.6	I have said, You
PSA.82.7	But you
PSA.82.8	Arise, O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.83.1	Keep not your
PSA.83.2	For, lo, your
PSA.83.3	They have taken crafty counsel against your
PSA.83.4	They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from 
PSA.83.5	For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against you
PSA.83.6	The tabernacles of Edom 
PSA.83.7	G’val 
PSA.83.8	Ashur 
PSA.83.9	Do unto them as 
PSA.83.11	Make their nobles like ‘Orev 
PSA.83.12	Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God-Elōhīm 
PSA.83.13	O my God-Elōhīm 
PSA.83.14	As the fire burns a wood, and as the flame sets the mountains on fire;
PSA.83.15	So persecute them with your
PSA.83.16	Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek your
PSA.83.17	Let them be confounded and troubled forever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:
PSA.83.18	That 
PSA.84.1	How amiable 
PSA.84.2	My soul longs, yea, even faints for the courts of the 
PSA.84.3	Yea, the sparrow has found an house, and the swallow 
PSA.84.4	Blessed 
PSA.84.5	Blessed 
PSA.84.7	They go from strength to strength, 
PSA.84.8	O 
PSA.84.9	Behold, O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.84.10	For a day in your
PSA.84.11	For the 
PSA.84.12	O 
PSA.85.1	-Yehōvah 
PSA.85.2	you
PSA.85.3	you
PSA.85.4	Turn us, O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.85.5	Will you
PSA.85.6	Will you
PSA.85.7	Show us your
PSA.85.8	I will hear what God-Elōhīm 
PSA.85.9	Surely his salvation 
PSA.85.10	Mercy and tare met together; righteousness and peace have kissed 
PSA.85.11	Tshall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.
PSA.85.12	Yea, the 
PSA.85.13	Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set 
PSA.86.1	Bow down your
PSA.86.2	Preserve my soul; for I 
PSA.86.3	Be merciful unto me, O Lord-Adonai 
PSA.86.4	Rejoice the soul of your
PSA.86.5	For you
PSA.86.6	Give ear, O 
PSA.86.7	In the day of my trouble I will call upon you
PSA.86.8	Among the gods 
PSA.86.9	All nations whom you
PSA.86.10	For you
PSA.86.11	Teach me your
PSA.86.12	I will praise you
PSA.86.13	For great 
PSA.86.14	O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.86.15	But you
PSA.86.16	O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give your
PSA.86.17	Show me a token for good; that they which hate me may see 
PSA.87.1	His foundation 
PSA.87.2	The 
PSA.87.3	Glorious things are spoken of you
PSA.87.4	I will make mention of Rachav 
PSA.87.5	And of Tziyon 
PSA.87.6	The 
PSA.87.7	As well the singers as the players on instruments 
PSA.88.1	O 
PSA.88.2	Let my prayer come before you
PSA.88.3	For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draws near unto the grave.
PSA.88.4	I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man 
PSA.88.5	Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom you
PSA.88.6	you
PSA.88.7	Your
PSA.88.8	you
PSA.88.9	Mine eye mourns by reason of affliction: 
PSA.88.10	Will you
PSA.88.11	Shall your
PSA.88.12	Shall your
PSA.88.13	But unto you
PSA.88.14	-Yehōvah 
PSA.88.15	I 
PSA.88.16	Your
PSA.88.17	They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.
PSA.88.18	Lover and friend have you
PSA.89.1	I will sing of the mercies of the 
PSA.89.2	For I have said, Mercy shall be built up forever: your
PSA.89.3	I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David 
PSA.89.4	Your
PSA.89.5	And the heavens shall praise your
PSA.89.6	For who in the heaven can be compared unto the 
PSA.89.7	God-Elōhīm 
PSA.89.8	O 
PSA.89.9	you
PSA.89.10	you
PSA.89.11	The heavens 
PSA.89.12	The north and the south you
PSA.89.13	you
PSA.89.14	Justice and judgment 
PSA.89.15	Blessed 
PSA.89.16	In your
PSA.89.17	For you
PSA.89.18	For the 
PSA.89.19	Then you
PSA.89.20	I have found David 
PSA.89.21	With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.
PSA.89.22	The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
PSA.89.23	And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.
PSA.89.24	But my faithfulness and my mercy 
PSA.89.25	I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.
PSA.89.26	He shall cry unto me, you
PSA.89.27	Also I will make him 
PSA.89.28	My mercy will I keep for him forevermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.
PSA.89.29	His seed also will I make 
PSA.89.30	If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;
PSA.89.31	If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;
PSA.89.32	Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.
PSA.89.33	Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
PSA.89.34	My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.
PSA.89.35	Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David 
PSA.89.36	His seed shall endure forever, and his throne as the sun before me.
PSA.89.37	It shall be established forever as the moon, and 
PSA.89.38	But you
PSA.89.39	you
PSA.89.40	you
PSA.89.41	All that pass by the way spoil 
PSA.89.42	you
PSA.89.43	you
PSA.89.44	you
PSA.89.45	The days of his youth have you
PSA.89.46	How long, 
PSA.89.47	Remember how short my time is: wherefore have you
PSA.89.48	What man 
PSA.89.49	Lord-Adonai 
PSA.89.50	Remember, Lord-Adonai 
PSA.89.51	Wherewith your
PSA.89.52	Blessed 
PSA.90.1	Lord-Adonai 
PSA.90.2	Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever you
PSA.90.3	you
PSA.90.4	For a thousand years in your
PSA.90.5	you
PSA.90.6	In the morning it flourishes, and grows up; in the evening it is cut down, and withers.
PSA.90.7	For we are consumed by your
PSA.90.8	you
PSA.90.9	For all our days are passed away in your
PSA.90.10	The days of our years 
PSA.90.11	Who knows the power of your
PSA.90.12	So teach 
PSA.90.13	Return, O 
PSA.90.14	O satisfy us early with your
PSA.90.15	Make us glad according to the days 
PSA.90.16	Let your
PSA.90.17	And let the beauty of the Lord-Adonai 
PSA.91.1	He that dwells in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
PSA.91.2	I will say of the 
PSA.91.3	Surely he shall deliver you
PSA.91.4	He shall cover you
PSA.91.5	you
PSA.91.7	A thousand shall fall at your
PSA.91.8	Only with your
PSA.91.9	Because you
PSA.91.10	There shall no evil befall you
PSA.91.11	For he shall give his angels charge over you
PSA.91.12	They shall bear you
PSA.91.13	you
PSA.91.14	Because he has set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he has known my name.
PSA.91.15	He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I 
PSA.91.16	With long life will I satisfy him, and show him my salvation.
PSA.92.2	To show forth your
PSA.92.3	Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the Psaltery 
PSA.92.4	For you
PSA.92.5	O 
PSA.92.6	A “stupid as a beast” man knows not; neither does a fool understand this.
PSA.92.7	When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; 
PSA.92.8	But you
PSA.92.9	For, lo, your
PSA.92.10	But my horn shall you
PSA.92.11	Mine eye also shall see 
PSA.92.12	The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in L’vanon 
PSA.92.13	Those that be planted in the house of the 
PSA.92.14	They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;
PSA.92.15	To show that the 
PSA.93.1	The 
PSA.93.2	Your
PSA.93.3	The floods have lifted up, O 
PSA.93.4	The 
PSA.93.5	Your
PSA.94.1	O 
PSA.94.2	Lift up yourself, you
PSA.94.3	-Yehōvah 
PSA.94.5	They break in pieces your
PSA.94.6	They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.
PSA.94.7	Yet they say, The 
PSA.94.8	Understand, you
PSA.94.9	He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?
PSA.94.10	He that chastises the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teaches man knowledge, 
PSA.94.11	The 
PSA.94.12	Blessed 
PSA.94.13	That you
PSA.94.14	For the 
PSA.94.15	But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.
PSA.94.16	Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? 
PSA.94.17	Unless the 
PSA.94.18	When I said, My foot slips; you
PSA.94.19	In the multitude of my thoughts within me your
PSA.94.20	Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with you
PSA.94.21	They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.
PSA.94.22	But the 
PSA.94.23	And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; 
PSA.95.1	O come, let us sing unto the 
PSA.95.2	Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with Tehillim 
PSA.95.3	For the 
PSA.95.4	In his hand 
PSA.95.5	The sea 
PSA.95.6	O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the 
PSA.95.7	For he 
PSA.95.8	Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, 
PSA.95.9	When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.
PSA.95.10	Forty years long was I grieved with 
PSA.95.11	Unto whom I swore in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.
PSA.96.1	O sing unto the 
PSA.96.2	Sing unto the 
PSA.96.3	Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.
PSA.96.4	For the 
PSA.96.5	For all the gods of the nations 
PSA.96.6	Honour and majesty 
PSA.96.7	Give unto the 
PSA.96.8	Give unto the 
PSA.96.9	O worship the 
PSA.96.10	Say among the heathen 
PSA.96.11	Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof.
PSA.96.12	Let the field be joyful, and all that 
PSA.96.13	Before the 
PSA.97.1	The 
PSA.97.2	Clouds and darkness 
PSA.97.3	A fire goes before him, and burns up his enemies round about.
PSA.97.4	His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.
PSA.97.5	The hills melted like grow 
PSA.97.6	The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.
PSA.97.7	Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all 
PSA.97.8	Tziyon 
PSA.97.9	For you
PSA.97.10	You
PSA.97.11	Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.
PSA.97.12	Rejoice in the 
PSA.98.1	O sing unto the 
PSA.98.2	The 
PSA.98.3	He has remembered his mercy and his ttoward the house of Yisra’el 
PSA.98.4	Make a joyful noise unto the 
PSA.98.5	Sing unto the 
PSA.98.6	With trumpets and sound of cornet 
PSA.98.7	Let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
PSA.98.8	Let the floods clap 
PSA.98.9	Before the 
PSA.99.1	The 
PSA.99.2	The 
PSA.99.3	Let them praise your
PSA.99.4	The king’s strength also loves judgment; you
PSA.99.5	Exalt you
PSA.99.6	Moshe 
PSA.99.7	He spoke unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance 
PSA.99.8	you
PSA.99.9	Exalt the 
PSA.100.1	Make a joyful noise unto the 
PSA.100.2	Serve the 
PSA.100.3	Know you
PSA.100.4	Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, 
PSA.100.5	For the 
PSA.101.1	I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto you
PSA.101.2	I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when will you
PSA.101.3	I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; 
PSA.101.4	A perverse 
PSA.101.5	Whoso secretly slanders his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that has an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.
PSA.101.6	Mine eyes 
PSA.101.7	He that works deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that tells lies shall not tarry in my sight.
PSA.101.8	I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the 
PSA.102.1	Hear my prayer, O 
PSA.102.2	Hide not your
PSA.102.3	For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.
PSA.102.4	My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.
PSA.102.5	By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave 
PSA.102.6	I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.
PSA.102.7	I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.
PSA.102.8	Mine enemies reproach 
PSA.102.9	For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,
PSA.102.10	Because of your
PSA.102.11	My days 
PSA.102.12	But you
PSA.102.13	you
PSA.102.14	For your
PSA.102.15	So the heathen shall fear the name of the 
PSA.102.16	When the 
PSA.102.17	He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.
PSA.102.18	This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the 
PSA.102.19	For he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the 
PSA.102.20	To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;
PSA.102.21	To declare the name of the 
PSA.102.22	When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the 
PSA.102.23	He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.
PSA.102.24	I said, O my God-Elōhīm 
PSA.102.25	Of old have you
PSA.102.26	They shall perish, but you
PSA.102.27	But you
PSA.102.28	The children of your
PSA.103.1	Bless the 
PSA.103.2	Bless the 
PSA.103.3	Who forgives all your
PSA.103.4	Who redeems your
PSA.103.5	Who satisfies your
PSA.103.6	The 
PSA.103.7	He made known his ways unto Moshe 
PSA.103.8	The 
PSA.103.9	He will not always quarrel: neither will he keep 
PSA.103.10	He has not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
PSA.103.11	For as the heaven is high above the earth, 
PSA.103.12	As far as the east is from the west, 
PSA.103.13	Like as a father pities 
PSA.103.14	For he knows our frame; he remembers that we 
PSA.103.16	For the wind passes over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.
PSA.103.17	But the mercy of the 
PSA.103.18	To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.
PSA.103.19	The 
PSA.103.20	Bless the 
PSA.103.21	Bless you
PSA.103.22	Bless the 
PSA.104.1	Bless the 
PSA.104.2	Who cover 
PSA.104.3	Who lays the beams of his chambers in the waters: who makes the clouds his chariot: who walks upon the wings of the wind:
PSA.104.4	Who makes his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:
PSA.104.6	you
PSA.104.7	At your
PSA.104.8	They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which you
PSA.104.9	you
PSA.104.10	He send the springs into the valleys, 
PSA.104.11	They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.
PSA.104.12	By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, 
PSA.104.13	He waters the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of your
PSA.104.14	He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;
PSA.104.15	And wine 
PSA.104.16	The trees of the 
PSA.104.17	Where the birds make their nests: 
PSA.104.18	The high hills 
PSA.104.19	He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knows his going down.
PSA.104.20	you
PSA.104.21	The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God-Elōhīm 
PSA.104.22	The sun arises, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.
PSA.104.23	Man goes forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.
PSA.104.24	O 
PSA.104.26	There go the ships: 
PSA.104.27	These wait all upon you
PSA.104.29	you
PSA.104.30	you
PSA.104.31	The glory of the 
PSA.104.32	He looks on the earth, and it trembles: he touches the hills, and they smoke.
PSA.104.33	I will sing unto the 
PSA.104.34	My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the 
PSA.104.35	Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless you
PSA.105.1	O give thanks unto the 
PSA.105.2	Sing unto him, sing Tehillim 
PSA.105.3	Glory you
PSA.105.4	Seek the 
PSA.105.5	Remember his marvelous works that he has done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
PSA.105.6	O you
PSA.105.7	He 
PSA.105.8	He has remembered his covenant forever, the word 
PSA.105.9	Which 
PSA.105.10	And confirmed the same unto Ya’akov 
PSA.105.11	Saying, Unto you
PSA.105.12	When they were 
PSA.105.13	When they went from one nation to another, from 
PSA.105.14	He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;
PSA.105.16	Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.
PSA.105.17	He sent a man before them, 
PSA.105.18	Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in Yir’on 
PSA.105.19	Until the time that his word came: the word of the 
PSA.105.20	The king sent and loosed him; 
PSA.105.21	He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:
PSA.105.22	To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.
PSA.105.23	Yisra’el 
PSA.105.24	And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.
PSA.105.25	He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtly with his servants.
PSA.105.26	He sent Moshe 
PSA.105.27	They showed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
PSA.105.28	He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.
PSA.105.29	He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
PSA.105.30	Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.
PSA.105.31	He spoke, and there came diverse sorts of flies, 
PSA.105.32	He gave them hail for rain, 
PSA.105.33	He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.
PSA.105.34	He spoke, and the locusts came, and caterpillars, and that without number,
PSA.105.35	And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.
PSA.105.36	He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.
PSA.105.37	He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and 
PSA.105.38	Mitzrayim 
PSA.105.39	He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.
PSA.105.41	He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places 
PSA.105.42	For he remembered his holy promise, 
PSA.105.43	And he brought forth his people with joy, 
PSA.105.44	And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;
PSA.105.45	That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise you
PSA.106.1	Praise you
PSA.106.2	Who can utter the mighty acts of the 
PSA.106.3	Blessed 
PSA.106.4	Remember me, O 
PSA.106.5	That I may see the good of your
PSA.106.6	We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
PSA.106.7	Our fathers understood not your
PSA.106.8	Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.
PSA.106.9	He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.
PSA.106.10	And he saved them from the hand of him that hated 
PSA.106.11	And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.
PSA.106.12	Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.
PSA.106.13	They soon forgot his works; they waited not for his counsel:
PSA.106.14	But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God-Elōhīm 
PSA.106.15	And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.
PSA.106.16	They envied Moshe 
PSA.106.17	The earth opened and swallow 
PSA.106.18	And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
PSA.106.19	They made a calf in Horev 
PSA.106.20	Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eats grass.
PSA.106.21	They forgot God-Elōhīm 
PSA.106.22	Wondrous works in the land of Ham, 
PSA.106.23	Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moshe 
PSA.106.24	Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:
PSA.106.25	But murmured in their tents, 
PSA.106.26	Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:
PSA.106.27	To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.
PSA.106.28	They joined themselves also unto Ba’al-P’or 
PSA.106.29	Thus they provoked 
PSA.106.30	Then stood up Pinchas 
PSA.106.31	And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations forevermore.
PSA.106.32	They angered 
PSA.106.33	Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips.
PSA.106.34	They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the 
PSA.106.35	But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
PSA.106.36	And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
PSA.106.37	Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,
PSA.106.38	And shed innocent blood, 
PSA.106.39	Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.
PSA.106.40	Therefore was the wrath of the 
PSA.106.41	And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.
PSA.106.42	Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.
PSA.106.43	Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked 
PSA.106.44	Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:
PSA.106.45	And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
PSA.106.46	He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.
PSA.106.47	Save us, O 
PSA.106.48	Blessed 
PSA.107.1	O give thanks unto the 
PSA.107.2	Let the redeemed of the 
PSA.107.3	And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.
PSA.107.4	They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.
PSA.107.5	Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
PSA.107.6	Then they cried unto the 
PSA.107.7	And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.
PSA.107.8	Oh that 
PSA.107.9	For he satisfies the longing soul, and fills the hungry soul with goodness.
PSA.107.10	Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, 
PSA.107.11	Because they rebelled against the words of God-Elōhīm 
PSA.107.12	Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and 
PSA.107.13	Then they cried unto the 
PSA.107.14	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.
PSA.107.15	Oh that 
PSA.107.16	For he has broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of Yir’on 
PSA.107.17	Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
PSA.107.18	Their soul abhors all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.
PSA.107.19	Then they cry unto the 
PSA.107.20	He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered 
PSA.107.21	Oh that 
PSA.107.22	And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.
PSA.107.23	They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;
PSA.107.24	These see the works of the 
PSA.107.25	For he commands, and raises the stormy wind, which lifts up the waves thereof.
PSA.107.26	They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.
PSA.107.27	They reel 
PSA.107.28	Then they cry unto the 
PSA.107.29	He makes the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.
PSA.107.30	Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he brings them unto their desired haven.
PSA.107.31	Oh that 
PSA.107.32	Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
PSA.107.33	He turns rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;
PSA.107.34	A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
PSA.107.35	He turns the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.
PSA.107.36	And there he makes the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;
PSA.107.37	And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.
PSA.107.38	He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffers not their cattle to decrease.
PSA.107.39	Again, they are diminished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.
PSA.107.40	He pours contempt upon princes, and causes them to wander in the wilderness, 
PSA.107.41	Yet sets he the poor on high from affliction, and makes 
PSA.107.42	The righteous shall see 
PSA.107.43	Whoso 
PSA.108.1	O God-Elōhīm 
PSA.108.2	Awake, Psaltery 
PSA.108.3	I will praise you
PSA.108.4	For your
PSA.108.5	Be you
PSA.108.6	That your
PSA.108.7	God-Elōhīm 
PSA.108.8	Gil’ad 
PSA.108.9	Mo’av 
PSA.108.10	Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom 
PSA.108.12	Give us help from trouble: for vain 
PSA.108.13	Through God-Elōhīm 
PSA.109.1	Hold not your
PSA.109.2	For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
PSA.109.3	They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.
PSA.109.4	For my love they are my adversaries: but I 
PSA.109.5	And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
PSA.109.6	Set you
PSA.109.7	When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.
PSA.109.8	Let his days be few; 
PSA.109.9	Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
PSA.109.10	Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek 
PSA.109.11	Let the extortioner catch all that he has; and let the strangers spoil 
PSA.109.12	Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.
PSA.109.13	Let his posterity be cut off; 
PSA.109.14	Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the 
PSA.109.15	Let them be before the 
PSA.109.16	Because that he remembered not to show mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.
PSA.109.17	As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.
PSA.109.18	As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels 
PSA.109.19	Let it be unto him as the garment 
PSA.109.21	But do you
PSA.109.22	For I 
PSA.109.23	I am gone like the shadow when it declines: I am tossed up and down as the locust.
PSA.109.24	My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh fails of fatness.
PSA.109.25	I became also a reproach 
PSA.109.26	Help me, O 
PSA.109.27	That they may know that this 
PSA.109.28	Let them curse, but bless you
PSA.109.29	Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a Mantle 
PSA.109.30	I will greatly praise the 
PSA.109.31	For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save 
PSA.110.1	The 
PSA.110.2	The 
PSA.110.3	Your
PSA.110.4	The 
PSA.110.5	The Lord-Adonai 
PSA.110.6	He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill 
PSA.110.7	He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.
PSA.111.1	Praise you
PSA.111.2	The works of the 
PSA.111.3	His work 
PSA.111.4	He has made his wonderful works to be remembered: the 
PSA.111.5	He has given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.
PSA.111.6	He has showed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.
PSA.111.7	The works of his hands 
PSA.111.8	They stand fast forever and ever, 
PSA.111.9	He sent redemption unto his people: he has commanded his covenant forever: holy and reverend 
PSA.111.10	The fear of the 
PSA.112.1	Praise you
PSA.112.2	His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be Blessed 
PSA.112.3	Wealth and riches 
PSA.112.4	Unto the upright there arises light in the darkness: 
PSA.112.5	A good man shows favour, and lends: he will guide his affairs with discretion.
PSA.112.6	Surely he shall not be moved forever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.
PSA.112.7	He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the 
PSA.112.8	His heart 
PSA.112.9	He has dispersed, he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.
PSA.112.10	The wicked shall see 
PSA.113.1	Praise you
PSA.113.2	Blessed 
PSA.113.3	From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the 
PSA.113.4	The 
PSA.113.5	Who 
PSA.113.6	Who humbles 
PSA.113.7	He raises up the poor out of the dust, 
PSA.113.8	That he may set 
PSA.113.9	He makes the barren woman to keep house, 
PSA.114.1	When Yisra’el 
PSA.114.2	Y’hudah 
PSA.114.3	The sea saw 
PSA.114.4	The mountains skipped like rams, 
PSA.114.5	What 
PSA.114.6	You
PSA.114.7	Tremble, you
PSA.114.8	Which turned the rock 
PSA.115.1	Not unto us, O 
PSA.115.2	For what reason should the heathen say, Where 
PSA.115.3	But our God-Elōhīm 
PSA.115.4	Their idols 
PSA.115.5	They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:
PSA.115.6	They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:
PSA.115.7	They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.
PSA.115.8	They that make them are like unto them; 
PSA.115.9	O Yisra’el 
PSA.115.10	O house of Aharon 
PSA.115.11	You
PSA.115.12	The 
PSA.115.13	He will bless them that fear the 
PSA.115.14	The 
PSA.115.15	You
PSA.115.16	The heaven, 
PSA.115.17	The dead praise not the 
PSA.115.18	But we will bless the 
PSA.116.1	I love the 
PSA.116.2	Because he has inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon 
PSA.116.3	The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell got hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.
PSA.116.4	Then called I upon the name of the 
PSA.116.5	Gracious 
PSA.116.6	The 
PSA.116.7	Return unto your
PSA.116.8	For you
PSA.116.9	I will walk before the 
PSA.116.10	I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:
PSA.116.11	I said in my haste, All men 
PSA.116.12	What shall I render unto the 
PSA.116.13	I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the 
PSA.116.14	I will pay my vows unto the 
PSA.116.15	Precious in the sight of the 
PSA.116.16	O 
PSA.116.17	I will offer to you
PSA.116.18	I will pay my vows unto the

PSA.118.6	The 
PSA.118.7	The 
PSA.118.10	All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the 
PSA.118.11	They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the 
PSA.118.12	They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the 
PSA.118.13	you
PSA.118.14	The 
PSA.118.15	The voice of rejoicing and salvation 
PSA.118.16	The right hand of the

PSA.118.18	The 
PSA.118.19	Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, 
PSA.118.20	This gate of the 
PSA.118.21	I will praise you
PSA.118.22	The stone 
PSA.118.23	This is the

PSA.119.10	With my whole heart have I sought you
PSA.119.11	Your

PSA.119.50	This 
PSA.119.51	The proud have had me greatly in ridicule 
PSA.119.52	I remembered your
PSA.119.53	Horror has taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake your
PSA.119.54	Your
PSA.119.55	I have remembered your
PSA.119.56	This I had, because I kept your
PSA.119.57	CHETH. 
PSA.119.58	I intreated your
PSA.119.59	I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto your
PSA.119.60	I made haste, and delayed not to keep your
PSA.119.61	The bands of the wicked have robbed me: 
PSA.119.62	At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto you
PSA.119.63	I

PSA.119.65	TETH. you
PSA.119.66	Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed you
PSA.119.67	Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept your
PSA.119.68	you
PSA.119.69	The proud have forged a lie against me: 
PSA.119.70	Their heart is as fat as grease; 
PSA.119.72	The law of your
PSA.119.73	JOD. Your

PSA.119.75	I know, O 
PSA.119.76	Let, I pray you
PSA.119.77	Let your

PSA.119.79	Let those that fear you
PSA.119.80	Let my heart be sound in your
PSA.119.81	CAPH. My soul faints for your
PSA.119.82	Mine eyes fail for your
PSA.119.83	For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; 
PSA.119.84	How many 
PSA.119.85	The proud have digged pits for me, which 
PSA.119.86	All your

PSA.119.97	MEM. O how love I your
PSA.119.98	you
PSA.119.99	I have more understanding than all my teachers: for your
PSA.119.100	I understand more than the ancients, because I keep your
PSA.119.101	I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep your
PSA.119.102	I have not departed from your

PSA.119.107	I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O 
PSA.119.108	Accept, I beseech 
PSA.119.109	My soul 
PSA.119.110	The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from your

PSA.119.122	Be surety for your
PSA.119.123	Mine eyes fail for your
PSA.119.124	Deal with your

PSA.119.130	The entrance of your

PSA.119.142	Your
PSA.119.143	Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: 
PSA.119.144	The righteousness of your
PSA.119.145	KOPH. I cried with 
PSA.119.146	I cried unto you
PSA.119.147	I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in your

PSA.119.176	I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek your
PSA.120.1	In my distress I cried unto the 
PSA.120.2	Deliver my soul, O 
PSA.120.3	What shall be given unto you
PSA.120.4	Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.
PSA.120.5	Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshekh 
PSA.120.6	My soul has long dwelt with him that hates peace.

PSA.121.2	My help 
PSA.121.3	He will not suffer your

PSA.121.6	The sun shall not smite you
PSA.121.7	The 
PSA.121.8	The 
PSA.122.1	I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the 
PSA.122.2	Our feet shall stand within your
PSA.122.3	Yerushalayim 
PSA.122.4	To where the tribes go up, the tribes of the

PSA.124.4	Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:
PSA.124.5	Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.
PSA.124.6	Blessed 
PSA.124.7	Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.
PSA.124.8	Our help

PSA.125.4	Do good, O 
PSA.125.5	As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the 
PSA.126.1	When the 
PSA.126.2	Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The 
PSA.126.3	The 
PSA.126.4	Turn again our captivity, O 
PSA.126.5	They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
PSA.126.6	He that goes forth and weeps, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves

PSA.132.5	Until I find out a place for the 
PSA.132.6	Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah 
PSA.132.7	We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.

PRO.3.21	My son, let not them depart from you
PRO.3.22	So shall they be life unto you
PRO.3.23	Then shall you
PRO.3.24	When you
PRO.3.25	Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.
PRO.3.26	For the 
PRO.3.27	Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your
PRO.3.28	Say not unto your
PRO.3.29	Devise not evil against you
PRO.3.30	Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done you
PRO.3.31	Envy you
PRO.3.32	For the perverse 
PRO.3.33	The curse of the 
PRO.3.34	Surely he scorns the scorners: but he gives grace unto the lowly.
PRO.3.35	The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.
PRO.4.1	Hear, you
PRO.4.2	For I give you good doctrine, forsake you
PRO.4.3	For I was my father’s son, tender and only 
PRO.4.4	He taught me also, and said unto me, Let you
PRO.4.5	Get wisdom, get understanding: forget 
PRO.4.6	Forsake her not, and she shall preserve you
PRO.4.7	Wisdom 
PRO.4.8	Exalt her, and she shall promote you
PRO.4.9	She shall give to you
PRO.4.10	Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of you
PRO.4.11	I have taught you
PRO.4.12	When you
PRO.4.13	Take fast hold of instruction; let 
PRO.4.14	Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil 
PRO.4.15	Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.
PRO.4.16	For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause 
PRO.4.17	For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
PRO.4.18	But the path of the just 
PRO.4.19	The way of the wicked 
PRO.4.20	My son, attend to my words; incline you
PRO.4.21	Let them not depart from you
PRO.4.22	For they 
PRO.4.23	Keep you
PRO.4.24	Put away from you
PRO.4.25	Let you
PRO.4.26	Ponder the path of you
PRO.4.27	Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove you
PRO.5.1	My son, attend unto my wisdom, 
PRO.5.2	That you
PRO.5.3	For the lips of a strange woman drop 
PRO.5.4	But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.
PRO.5.5	Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.
PRO.5.6	Lest you
PRO.5.7	Hear me now therefore, O you
PRO.5.8	Remove you
PRO.5.9	Lest you
PRO.5.10	Lest strangers be filled with you
PRO.5.11	And you
PRO.5.12	And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof 
PRO.5.13	And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
PRO.5.14	I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.
PRO.5.15	Drink waters out of you
PRO.5.16	Let you
PRO.5.17	Let them be only you
PRO.5.18	Let you
PRO.5.20	And why will you
PRO.5.21	For the ways of man 
PRO.5.22	His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be held with the cords of his sins.
PRO.5.23	He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
PRO.6.1	My son, if you
PRO.6.2	you
PRO.6.3	Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, when you
PRO.6.4	Give not sleep to you
PRO.6.5	Deliver yourself as a roe from the hand 
PRO.6.6	Go to the ant, you
PRO.6.7	Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
PRO.6.8	Provides her meat in the summer, 
PRO.6.9	How long will you
PRO.6.11	So shall you
PRO.6.12	A naughty person, a wicked man, walks with a perverse 
PRO.6.13	He winks with his eyes, he speaks with his feet, he teaches with his fingers;
PRO.6.14	Frowardness 
PRO.6.15	Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.
PRO.6.16	These six 
PRO.6.17	A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
PRO.6.18	An heart that devises wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,
PRO.6.19	A false witness 
PRO.6.20	My son, keep you
PRO.6.21	Bind them continually upon you
PRO.6.22	When you
PRO.6.23	For the commandment 
PRO.6.24	To keep you
PRO.6.25	Lust not after her beauty in you
PRO.6.26	For by means of a whorish woman 
PRO.6.27	Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
PRO.6.28	Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?
PRO.6.29	So he that goes in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever touches her shall not be innocent.
PRO.6.31	But 
PRO.6.33	A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach 
PRO.6.34	For jealousy 
PRO.6.35	He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though you
PRO.7.1	My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with you
PRO.7.2	Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of you
PRO.7.3	Bind them upon you
PRO.7.4	Say unto wisdom, you
PRO.7.5	That they may keep you
PRO.7.6	For at the window of my house I looked through my window,
PRO.7.7	And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,
PRO.7.8	Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,
PRO.7.9	In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:
PRO.7.10	And, behold, there met him a woman 
PRO.7.11	(She 
PRO.7.12	Now 
PRO.7.13	So she caught him, and kissed him, 
PRO.7.15	Therefore came I forth to meet you
PRO.7.16	I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved 
PRO.7.17	I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
PRO.7.18	Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.
PRO.7.19	For the goodman 
PRO.7.20	He has taken a bag of money with him, 
PRO.7.21	With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.
PRO.7.22	He goes after her immediately, as an ox goes to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;
PRO.7.23	Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hastes to the snare, and knows not that it 
PRO.7.24	Hearken unto me now therefore, O you
PRO.7.25	Let not you
PRO.7.26	For she has cast down many wounded: yea, many strong 
PRO.7.27	Her house 
PRO.8.1	Does not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?
PRO.8.2	She stands in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.
PRO.8.3	She cries at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.
PRO.8.4	Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice 
PRO.8.5	O you
PRO.8.6	Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips 
PRO.8.7	For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness 
PRO.8.8	All the words of my mouth 
PRO.8.9	They 
PRO.8.10	Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.
PRO.8.11	For wisdom 
PRO.8.12	I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.
PRO.8.13	The fear of the 
PRO.8.14	Counsel 
PRO.8.15	By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.
PRO.8.16	By me princes rule, and nobles, 
PRO.8.17	I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.
PRO.8.18	Riches and honour 
PRO.8.19	My fruit 
PRO.8.20	I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:
PRO.8.21	That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.
PRO.8.22	The 
PRO.8.23	I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.
PRO.8.24	When 
PRO.8.25	Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:
PRO.8.26	While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.
PRO.8.27	When he prepared the heavens, I 
PRO.8.28	When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:
PRO.8.29	When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:
PRO.8.30	Then I was by him, 
PRO.8.31	Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights 
PRO.8.32	Now therefore hearken unto me, O you
PRO.8.33	Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.
PRO.8.34	Blessed 
PRO.8.35	For whoso finds me finds life, and shall obtain favour of the 
PRO.8.36	But he that sins against me wrongs his own soul: all they that hate me love death.
PRO.9.1	Wisdom has built her house, she has cut out her seven pillars:
PRO.9.2	She has killed her beasts; she has mingled her wine; she has also furnished her table.
PRO.9.3	She has sent forth her maidens: she cries upon the highest places of the city,
PRO.9.4	Whoso 
PRO.9.5	Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine 
PRO.9.6	Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.
PRO.9.7	He that reproves a scorner gets to himself shame: and he that rebukes a wicked 
PRO.9.8	Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate you
PRO.9.9	Give 
PRO.9.10	The fear of the 
PRO.9.11	For by me you
PRO.9.12	If you
PRO.9.13	A foolish woman 
PRO.9.14	For she sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
PRO.9.15	To call passengers who go right on their ways:
PRO.9.16	Whoso 
PRO.9.17	Stolen waters are sweet, and bread 
PRO.9.18	But he knows not that the dead

PRO.10.9	He that walks uprightly walks surely: but he that perverts his ways shall be known.
PRO.10.10	He that winks with the eye causes sorrow: but a babbling 
PRO.10.11	The mouth of a righteous 
PRO.10.12	Hatred stirs up strifes: but love covers all sins.
PRO.10.13	In the lips of him that has understanding wisdom is found: but a rod

PRO.10.16	The labour of the righteous

PRO.10.21	The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for lack of wisdom.
PRO.10.22	The blessing of the

PRO.10.32	The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked 
PRO.11.1	A false balance 
PRO.11.3	The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.
PRO.11.4	Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivers from death.
PRO.11.5	The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.
PRO.11.6	The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in 
PRO.11.7	When a wicked man dies, 
PRO.11.8	The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.
PRO.11.9	An hypocrite with 
PRO.11.10	When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices: and when the wicked perish, 
PRO.11.11	By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.

PRO.12.12	The wicked desires the net of evil 
PRO.12.13	The wicked is snared by the transgression of

PRO.12.20	Deceit

PRO.18.13	He that answers a matter before he hears 
PRO.18.14	The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?
PRO.18.15	The heart of the prudent gets knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.
PRO.18.16	A man’s gift makes room for him, and brings him before great men.
PRO.18.18	The Lot 
PRO.18.19	A brother offended 
PRO.18.20	A man’s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; 
PRO.18.21	Death and life 
PRO.18.23	The poor uses entreaties; but the rich answers roughly.
PRO.18.24	A man 
PRO.19.1	Better 
PRO.19.2	Also, 
PRO.19.3	The foolishness of man perverts his way: and his heart frets against the 
PRO.19.4	Wealth makes many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.
PRO.19.5	A false witness shall not be unpunished, and 
PRO.19.6	Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man 
PRO.19.7	All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursues 
PRO.19.8	He that gets wisdom loves his own soul: he that keeps understanding shall find good.
PRO.19.9	A false witness shall not be unpunished, and 
PRO.19.10	Delight is not seemly 
PRO.19.11	The discretion of a man defers his anger; and 
PRO.19.12	The king’s wrath 
PRO.19.13	A foolish son 
PRO.19.14	House and riches 
PRO.19.15	Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.

PRO.19.28	An ungodly witness scorns judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devours iniquity.
PRO.19.29	Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.
PRO.20.1	Wine 
PRO.20.2	The fear of a king 
PRO.20.4	The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; 
PRO.20.5	Counsel in the heart of man 
PRO.20.6	Most men will proclaim everyone his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?
PRO.20.7	The just 
PRO.20.8	A king that sits in the throne of judgment scatters away all evil with his eyes.

PRO.21.7	The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.
PRO.21.8	The way of man 
PRO.21.10	The soul of the wicked desires evil: his neighbour finds no favour in his eyes.
PRO.21.11	When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.
PRO.21.12	The righteous 
PRO.21.13	Whoso stops his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.
PRO.21.14	A gift in secret pacifies anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.
PRO.21.16	The man that wanders out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.
PRO.21.17	He that loves pleasure 
PRO.21.18	The wicked 
PRO.21.21	He that follows after righteousness and mercy finds life, righteousness, and honour.
PRO.21.22	A wise 
PRO.21.23	Whoso keeps his mouth and his tongue keeps his soul from troubles.
PRO.21.24	Proud 
PRO.21.25	The desire of the slothful kills him; for his hands refuse to labour.
PRO.21.26	He covets greedily all the day long: but the righteous gives and spares not.
PRO.21.27	The sacrifice of the wicked 
PRO.21.28	A false witness shall perish: but the man that hears speaks constantly.

PRO.22.7	The rich rules over the poor, and the borrower 
PRO.22.8	He that sows iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail.
PRO.22.9	He that has a bountiful eye shall be Blessed 
PRO.22.10	Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach 
PRO.22.11	He that loves pureness of heart,

PRO.23.29	Who has woe? who has sorrow? who has contentions? who has babbling? who has wounds without cause? who has redness of eyes?
PRO.23.30	They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.
PRO.23.31	Look not you
PRO.23.32	At the last it bites like a serpent, and stings like an adder.
PRO.23.33	You
PRO.23.34	Yea, you
PRO.23.35	They have stricken me, 
PRO.24.1	Be not you
PRO.24.2	For their heart studies destruction, and their lips talk of mischief.
PRO.24.3	Through wisdom is an house built; and by understanding it is established:
PRO.24.4	And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.
PRO.24.5	A wise man 
PRO.24.6	For by wise counsel you

PRO.24.17	Rejoice not when your

PRO.24.20	For there shall be no reward to the evil 
PRO.24.21	My son, fear you
PRO.24.22	For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knows the ruin of them both?
PRO.24.23	These 
PRO.24.24	He that says unto the wicked, you
PRO.24.25	But to them that rebuke 
PRO.24.27	Prepare you
PRO.24.28	Be not a witness against you
PRO.24.29	Say not, I will do so to him as he has done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.
PRO.24.30	I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;
PRO.24.31	And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, 
PRO.24.32	Then I saw, 
PRO.24.34	So shall your
PRO.25.1	These 
PRO.25.3	The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings 
PRO.25.4	Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.
PRO.25.5	Take away the wicked 
PRO.25.6	Put not forth yourself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great 
PRO.25.7	For better 
PRO.25.8	Go not forth hastily to strive, lest [you
PRO.25.9	Debate you
PRO.25.10	Lest he that hears 
PRO.25.11	A word fitly spoken 
PRO.25.13	As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, 
PRO.25.14	Whoso boasts himself of a false gift 
PRO.25.15	By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaks the bone.
PRO.25.16	Hast you
PRO.25.17	Withdraw you
PRO.25.18	A man that bears false witness against his neighbour 
PRO.25.19	Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble 
PRO.25.21	If you
PRO.25.22	For you
PRO.25.23	The north wind drives away rain: so 
PRO.25.26	A righteous man falling down before the wicked 
PRO.25.28	He that 
PRO.26.1	As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly 
PRO.26.2	As the bird by wandering, as the swallow 
PRO.26.3	A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool’s back.
PRO.26.4	Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest you
PRO.26.5	Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.
PRO.26.6	He that send a message by the hand of a fool cuts off the feet, 
PRO.26.7	The legs of the lame are not equal: so 
PRO.26.8	As he that binds a stone in a sling, so 
PRO.26.10	The great 
PRO.26.11	As a dog returns to his vomit, 
PRO.26.12	See you
PRO.26.13	The slothful 
PRO.26.15	The slothful hides his hand in 
PRO.26.16	The sluggard 
PRO.26.17	He that passes by, 
PRO.26.18	As a mad 
PRO.26.19	So 
PRO.26.20	Where no wood is, 
PRO.26.22	The words of a talebearer 
PRO.26.23	Burning lips and a wicked heart 
PRO.26.24	He that hates dissembles with his lips, and lays up deceit within him;
PRO.26.25	When he speaks fair, believe him not: for 
PRO.26.27	Whoso digs a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolls a stone, it will return upon him.
PRO.26.28	A lying tongue hates 
PRO.27.1	Boast not yourself of tomorrow; for you
PRO.27.2	Let another man praise you
PRO.27.3	A stone 
PRO.27.4	Wrath 
PRO.27.5	Open rebuke 
PRO.27.6	Faithful 
PRO.27.7	The full soul loathes an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.
PRO.27.8	As a bird that wanders from her nest, so 
PRO.27.9	Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so 
PRO.27.10	You
PRO.27.11	My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproaches me.
PRO.27.12	A prudent 
PRO.27.13	Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.
PRO.27.14	He that blesses his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.
PRO.27.15	A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious 
PRO.27.16	Whosoever hides her hides the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, 
PRO.27.17	Just as iron sharpens iron; so a man sharpens the Countenance 
PRO.27.18	Whoso keeps the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waits on his master shall be honoured.
PRO.27.19	As in water face 
PRO.27.20	Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.
PRO.27.22	Though you
PRO.27.23	Be you
PRO.27.24	For riches 
PRO.27.25	The hay appears, and the tender grass shows itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.
PRO.27.26	The lambs 
PRO.27.27	And [you
PRO.28.1	The wicked flee when no man pursues: but the righteous are bold as a lion.
PRO.28.2	For the transgression of a land many 
PRO.28.3	A poor man that oppresses the poor 
PRO.28.4	They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.
PRO.28.5	Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the 
PRO.28.6	Better 
PRO.28.7	Whoso keeps the law 
PRO.28.8	He that by usury 
PRO.28.9	He that turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer 
PRO.28.10	Whoso causes the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good 
PRO.28.11	The rich man 
PRO.28.12	When righteous 
PRO.28.13	He that covers his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesses and forsakes 
PRO.28.14	Happy 
PRO.28.16	The prince that wants understanding 
PRO.28.17	A man that does violence to the blood of 
PRO.28.18	Whoso walks uprightly shall be saved: but 
PRO.28.19	He that tills his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that follows after vain 
PRO.28.20	A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that makes haste to be rich shall not be innocent.
PRO.28.21	To have respect of persons 
PRO.28.22	He that hastes to be rich 
PRO.28.23	He that rebukes a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flatters with the tongue.
PRO.28.24	Whoso robs his father or his mother, and says, 
PRO.28.25	He that is of a proud heart stirs up strife: but he that puts his trust in the 
PRO.28.26	He that trusts in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walks wisely, he shall be delivered.
PRO.28.27	He that gives unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hides his eyes shall have many a curse.
PRO.28.28	When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.
PRO.29.1	He, that being often reproved hardens 
PRO.29.2	When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked bears rule, the people mourn.
PRO.29.3	Whoso loves wisdom rejoices his father: but he that keeps company with harlots spends 
PRO.29.4	The king by judgment establishes the land: but he that receives gifts overthrows it.
PRO.29.5	A man that flatters his neighbour spreads a net for his feet.
PRO.29.6	In the transgression of an evil man 
PRO.29.7	The righteous considers the cause of the poor: 
PRO.29.8	Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise 
PRO.29.10	The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.
PRO.29.11	A fool utters all his mind: but a wise 
PRO.29.12	If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants 
PRO.29.13	The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the 
PRO.29.14	The king that faithfully the poor, his throne shall be established forever.
PRO.29.15	The rod and reproof 
PRO.29.16	When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increases: but the righteous shall see their fall.
PRO.29.17	Correct you
PRO.29.18	Where 
PRO.29.19	A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer.
PRO.29.20	See you
PRO.29.21	He that delicately brings up his servant from a child shall have him become 
PRO.29.22	An angry man stirs up strife, and a furious man abounds in transgression.
PRO.29.23	A man’s pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.
PRO.29.24	Whoso is partner with a thief hates his own soul: he hears cursing, and betrays 
PRO.29.25	The fear of man brings a snare: but whoso puts his trust in the

PRO.30.19	The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.
PRO.30.20	Such 
PRO.30.21	For three 
PRO.30.22	For a servant when he reigns; and a fool when he is filled with meat;
PRO.30.23	For an odious

PRO.30.31	A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom 
PRO.30.32	If you

PRO.31.1	The words of king L’mu’el 
PRO.31.2	What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?
PRO.31.3	Give not you
PRO.31.5	Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.
PRO.31.6	Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.
PRO.31.7	Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.
PRO.31.8	Open you
PRO.31.9	Open you
PRO.31.10	Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price 
PRO.31.11	The heart of her husband does safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil 
PRO.31.12	She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
PRO.31.13	She seeks wool, and flax, and works willingly with her hands.
PRO.31.14	She is like the merchants’ ships; she brings her food from afar.
PRO.31.15	She rises also while it is yet night, and gives meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.
PRO.31.16	She considers a field, and buys it: with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.
PRO.31.17	She girds her loins 
PRO.31.18	She perceives that her merchandise 
PRO.31.19	She lays her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.
PRO.31.20	She stretches out her hand to the poor; yea, she reaches forth her hands to the needy.
PRO.31.21	She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household 
PRO.31.22	She makes herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing 
PRO.31.23	Her husband is known in the gates, when he sits among the elders of the land.
PRO.31.24	She makes fine linen, and sells 
PRO.31.25	Strength and honour 
PRO.31.26	She opens her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue 
PRO.31.27	She looks well to the ways of her household, and eats not the bread of idleness.
PRO.31.28	Her children arise up, and call her Blessed 
PRO.31.29	Many daughters have done virtuously, but you
PRO.31.30	Favour 
PRO.31.31	Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.
JOB.1.1	There was a man in the land of ‘Utz 
JOB.1.2	And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
JOB.1.3	His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
JOB.1.4	And his sons went and feasted 
JOB.1.5	And it was so, when the days of 
JOB.1.6	Now there was a day when the sons of God-Elōhīm 
JOB.1.7	And the 
JOB.1.8	And the 
JOB.1.9	Then Satan answered the 
JOB.1.10	Have not you
JOB.1.11	But put forth you
JOB.1.12	And the 
JOB.1.13	And there was a day when his sons and his daughters 
JOB.1.14	And there came a messenger unto Iyov 
JOB.1.15	And the S’va 
JOB.1.16	While he 
JOB.1.17	While he 
JOB.1.18	While he 
JOB.1.19	And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell you
JOB.1.20	Then Iyov 
JOB.1.21	And said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return there: the 
JOB.1.22	In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God-Elōhīm 
JOB.2.1	Again there was a day when the sons of God-Elōhīm 
JOB.2.2	And the 
JOB.2.3	And the 
JOB.2.4	And Satan answered the 
JOB.2.5	But put forth you
JOB.2.6	And the 
JOB.2.7	So went Satan forth from the presence of the 
JOB.2.8	And he took him a potsherd 
JOB.2.9	Then said his wife unto him, Do you
JOB.2.10	But he said unto her, you
JOB.2.11	Now when Iyov’s 
JOB.2.12	And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his Mantle 
JOB.2.13	So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word unto him: for they saw that 
JOB.3.1	After this opened Iyov 
JOB.3.2	And Iyov 
JOB.3.3	Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night 
JOB.3.4	Let that day be darkness; let not God-Elōhīm 
JOB.3.5	Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
JOB.3.6	As 
JOB.3.7	Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come in it.
JOB.3.8	Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.
JOB.3.9	Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but 
JOB.3.10	Because it shut not up the doors of my 
JOB.3.11	Why died I not from the womb? 
JOB.3.12	Why did the knees prevent 
JOB.3.13	For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,
JOB.3.14	With kings and counselors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;
JOB.3.15	Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:
JOB.3.16	Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants 
JOB.3.17	There the wicked cease 
JOB.3.19	The small and great are there; and the servant 
JOB.3.20	For what reason is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter 
JOB.3.21	Which long for death, but it 
JOB.3.22	Which rejoice exceedingly, 
JOB.3.24	For my sighing comes before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.
JOB.3.25	For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.
JOB.3.26	I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.
JOB.4.1	Then Elifaz [my God is 
JOB.4.3	Behold, you
JOB.4.4	You
JOB.4.5	But now it is come upon you
JOB.4.7	Remember, I pray you
JOB.4.8	Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.
JOB.4.9	By the blast of God-Elōhīm 
JOB.4.10	The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
JOB.4.11	The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s whelps are scattered abroad.
JOB.4.12	Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a little thereof.
JOB.4.13	In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,
JOB.4.14	Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.
JOB.4.15	Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:
JOB.4.16	It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image 
JOB.4.17	Shall mortal man be more just than God-Elōhīm 
JOB.4.18	Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:
JOB.4.19	How much less 
JOB.4.20	They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish forever without any regarding 
JOB.4.21	Does not their excellency 
JOB.5.1	Call now, if there be any that will answer you
JOB.5.2	For wrath kills the foolish man, and envy slays the silly one.
JOB.5.3	I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
JOB.5.4	His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither 
JOB.5.5	Whose harvest the hungry eats up, and takes it even out of the thorns, and the robber swallow 
JOB.5.6	Although affliction comes not forth of the dust, neither does trouble spring out of the ground;
JOB.5.7	Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
JOB.5.8	I would seek unto God-Elōhīm 
JOB.5.9	Which does great things and unsearchable; marvelous things without number:
JOB.5.10	Who gives rain upon the earth, and send waters upon the fields:
JOB.5.11	To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.
JOB.5.12	He disappoints the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform 
JOB.5.13	He takes the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the perverse 
JOB.5.14	They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night.
JOB.5.15	But he saves the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.
JOB.5.16	So the poor has hope, and iniquity stops her mouth.
JOB.5.17	Behold, happy 
JOB.5.18	For he makes sore, and binds up: he wounds, and his hands make whole.
JOB.5.19	He shall deliver you
JOB.5.20	In famine he shall redeem you
JOB.5.21	you
JOB.5.22	At destruction and famine you
JOB.5.23	For you
JOB.5.24	And you
JOB.5.25	you
JOB.5.26	you
JOB.5.27	Lo this, we have searched it, so it 
JOB.6.1	But Iyov 
JOB.6.2	Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!
JOB.6.3	For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallow 
JOB.6.4	For the arrows of the Almighty 
JOB.6.5	Does the wild ass groan 
JOB.6.6	Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there 
JOB.6.7	The things 
JOB.6.8	Oh that I might have my request; and that God-Elōhīm 
JOB.6.9	Even that it would please God-Elōhīm 
JOB.6.10	Then should I yet have comfort; yes, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.
JOB.6.11	What 
JOB.6.14	To him that is afflicted pity 
JOB.6.15	My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, 
JOB.6.16	Which are blackish by reason of the ice, 
JOB.6.17	What time they grow 
JOB.6.18	The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.
JOB.6.19	The troops of Teima 
JOB.6.20	They were confounded because they had hoped; they came there, and were ashamed.
JOB.6.21	For now you
JOB.6.22	Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?
JOB.6.23	Or, Deliver me from the enemy’s hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?
JOB.6.24	Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
JOB.6.25	How forcible are right words! but what does your arguing reprove?
JOB.6.26	Do you
JOB.6.27	Yes, you
JOB.6.28	Now therefore be content, look upon me; for 
JOB.6.29	Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yes, return again, my righteousness 
JOB.6.30	Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?
JOB.7.2	As a servant earnestly desires the shadow, and as an employee 
JOB.7.3	So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.
JOB.7.4	When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.
JOB.7.5	My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.
JOB.7.6	My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without hope.
JOB.7.7	O remember that my life 
JOB.7.8	The eye of him that has seen me shall see me no 
JOB.7.10	He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him anymore.
JOB.7.11	Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
JOB.7.13	When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;
JOB.7.14	Then you
JOB.7.15	So that my soul chooses strangling, 
JOB.7.16	I loathe 
JOB.7.17	What 
JOB.7.18	And 
JOB.7.19	How long will you
JOB.7.20	I have sinned; what shall I do unto you
JOB.7.21	And why do you
JOB.8.1	Then answered Bildad 
JOB.8.2	How long will you
JOB.8.3	Does God-Elōhīm 
JOB.8.4	If you
JOB.8.5	If you
JOB.8.6	If you
JOB.8.7	Though you
JOB.8.8	For enquire, I pray you
JOB.8.9	(For we 
JOB.8.10	Shall not they teach you
JOB.8.11	Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?
JOB.8.12	Whilst it 
JOB.8.13	So 
JOB.8.14	Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust 
JOB.8.15	He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.
JOB.8.16	He 
JOB.8.17	His roots are wrapped about the heap, 
JOB.8.18	If he destroy him from his place, then 
JOB.8.19	Behold, this 
JOB.8.20	Behold, God-Elōhīm 
JOB.8.21	Till he fill you
JOB.8.22	They that hate you
JOB.9.1	Then Iyov 
JOB.9.2	I know 
JOB.9.3	If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.
JOB.9.5	Which removes the mountains, and they know not: which overturns them in his anger.
JOB.9.6	Which shakes the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.
JOB.9.7	Which commands the sun, and it rises not; and seals up the stars.
JOB.9.8	Which alone spreads out the heavens, and treads upon the waves of the sea.
JOB.9.9	Which makes ‘Ash 
JOB.9.10	Which does great things past finding out; yes, and wonders without number.
JOB.9.11	Lo, he goes by me, and I see 
JOB.9.12	Behold, he takes away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What do you
JOB.9.14	How much less shall I answer him, 
JOB.9.15	Whom, though I were righteous, 
JOB.9.16	If I had called, and he had answered me; 
JOB.9.17	For he breaks me with a tempest, and multiplies my wounds without cause.
JOB.9.18	He will not suffer me to take my breath, but fills me with bitterness.
JOB.9.19	If 
JOB.9.20	If I justify myself, my own mouth shall condemn me: 
JOB.9.22	This 
JOB.9.23	If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.
JOB.9.24	The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covers the faces of the thereof; if not, where, 
JOB.9.25	Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.
JOB.9.26	They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle 
JOB.9.27	If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort 
JOB.9.28	I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that you
JOB.9.30	If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;
JOB.9.31	Yet shall you
JOB.9.32	For 
JOB.9.33	Neither is there any arbitrator between us, 
JOB.9.34	Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:
JOB.10.1	My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
JOB.10.2	I will say unto God-Elōhīm 
JOB.10.4	Have you
JOB.10.6	That you
JOB.10.7	you
JOB.10.8	Your
JOB.10.9	Remember, I beseech 
JOB.10.10	Have you
JOB.10.11	you
JOB.10.12	you
JOB.10.13	And these 
JOB.10.14	If I sin, then you
JOB.10.15	If I be wicked, woe unto me; and 
JOB.10.16	For it increases. you
JOB.10.17	you
JOB.10.18	For what reason then have you
JOB.10.19	I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
JOB.10.21	Before I go 
JOB.10.22	A land of darkness, as darkness 
JOB.11.1	Then answered Tzofar 
JOB.11.2	Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?
JOB.11.3	Should you
JOB.11.4	For you
JOB.11.5	But oh that God-Elōhīm 
JOB.11.6	And that he would show you
JOB.11.7	Can you
JOB.11.9	The measure thereof 
JOB.11.10	If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?
JOB.11.11	For he knows vain men: he sees wickedness also; will he not then consider 
JOB.11.12	For vain man would be wise, though man be born 
JOB.11.13	If you
JOB.11.14	If iniquity 
JOB.11.15	For then shall you
JOB.11.16	Because you
JOB.11.17	And 
JOB.11.18	And you
JOB.11.19	Also you
JOB.11.20	But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope 
JOB.12.1	And Iyov 
JOB.12.2	No doubt but you
JOB.12.3	But I have understanding as well as you; I 
JOB.12.4	I am 
JOB.12.5	He that is ready to slip with 
JOB.12.6	The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God-Elōhīm 
JOB.12.7	But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach you
JOB.12.8	Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach you
JOB.12.9	Who knows not in all these that the hand of the 
JOB.12.10	In whose hand 
JOB.12.11	Does not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?
JOB.12.12	With the ancient 
JOB.12.13	With him 
JOB.12.14	Behold, he breaks down, and it cannot be built again: he shuts up a man, and there can be no opening.
JOB.12.15	Behold, he withholds the waters, and they dry up: also he send them out, and they overturn the earth.
JOB.12.16	With him 
JOB.12.17	He leads counselors away spoiled, and makes the fools.
JOB.12.18	He looses the bond of kings, and put on their waist with a belt.
JOB.12.19	He leads princes away spoiled, and overthrows the mighty.
JOB.12.20	He removes away the speech of the trusty, and takes away the understanding of the aged.
JOB.12.21	He pours contempt upon princes, and weakens the strength of the mighty.
JOB.12.22	He discovers deep things out of darkness, and brings out to light the shadow of death.
JOB.12.23	He increases the nations, and destroys them: he enlarges the nations, and straitens them 
JOB.12.24	He takes away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causes them to wander in a wilderness 
JOB.12.25	They grope in the dark without light, and he makes them to stagger like 
JOB.13.1	Lo, my eye has seen all 
JOB.13.2	What you
JOB.13.3	Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God-Elōhīm 
JOB.13.4	But you
JOB.13.5	O that you
JOB.13.6	Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
JOB.13.7	Will you
JOB.13.8	Will you
JOB.13.9	Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocks another, do you
JOB.13.10	He will surely reprove you, if you
JOB.13.11	Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?
JOB.13.12	Your remembrances 
JOB.13.13	Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what 
JOB.13.14	For what reason do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand?
JOB.13.15	Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain my own ways before him.
JOB.13.16	He also 
JOB.13.17	Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.
JOB.13.18	Behold now, I have ordered 
JOB.13.19	Who 
JOB.13.20	Only do not two 
JOB.13.21	Withdraw you
JOB.13.22	Then call you
JOB.13.23	How many 
JOB.13.24	For what reason hide you
JOB.13.25	Will you
JOB.13.26	For you
JOB.13.27	you
JOB.13.28	And he, as a rotten thing, consumes, as a garment that is moth eaten.
JOB.14.1	Man 
JOB.14.2	He comes forth like a flower, and is cut down: he flees also as a shadow, and continue not.
JOB.14.3	And do you
JOB.14.4	Who can bring a clean 
JOB.14.5	Seeing his days 
JOB.14.6	Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an employee 
JOB.14.7	For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.
JOB.14.8	Though the root thereof grow 
JOB.14.10	But man dies, and wastes away: yes, man gives up the ghost, and where 
JOB.14.12	So man lies down, and rises not: till the heavens 
JOB.14.13	O that you
JOB.14.14	If a man die, shall he live 
JOB.14.15	you
JOB.14.16	For now you
JOB.14.17	My transgression 
JOB.14.18	And surely the mountain falling comes to nothing, and the rock is removed out of his place.
JOB.14.19	The waters wear the stones: you
JOB.14.20	you
JOB.14.21	His sons come to honour, and he knows 
JOB.14.22	But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.
JOB.15.1	Then answered Elifaz [my God is 
JOB.15.2	Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?
JOB.15.3	Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches which he can do no good?
JOB.15.4	Yes, you
JOB.15.5	For your
JOB.15.6	Your
JOB.15.8	Have you
JOB.15.9	What know you
JOB.15.10	With us 
JOB.15.12	Why does you
JOB.15.13	That you
JOB.15.14	What 
JOB.15.15	Behold, he puts no trust in his saints; yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight.
JOB.15.16	How much more abominable and filthy 
JOB.15.17	I will show you
JOB.15.18	Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid 
JOB.15.19	Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.
JOB.15.20	The wicked man travails with pain all 
JOB.15.21	A dreadful sound 
JOB.15.22	He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.
JOB.15.23	He wanders abroad for bread, 
JOB.15.24	Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.
JOB.15.25	For he stretches out his hand against God-Elōhīm 
JOB.15.26	He runs upon him, 
JOB.15.27	Because he covers his face with his fatness, and makes blubber of fat on 
JOB.15.28	And he dwells in desolate cities, 
JOB.15.29	He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.
JOB.15.30	He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.
JOB.15.31	Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompense.
JOB.15.32	It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.
JOB.15.33	He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.
JOB.15.34	For the congregation of hypocrites 
JOB.15.35	They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepares deceit.
JOB.16.1	Then Iyov 
JOB.16.2	I have heard many such things: miserable comforters 
JOB.16.3	Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldens you
JOB.16.4	I also could speak as you
JOB.16.6	Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged: and 
JOB.16.7	But now he has made me weary: you
JOB.16.8	And you
JOB.16.9	He tears 
JOB.16.10	They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.
JOB.16.11	God-Elōhīm 
JOB.16.12	I was at ease, but he has broken me asunder: he has also taken 
JOB.16.13	His archers compass 
JOB.16.14	He breaks me with breach 
JOB.16.15	I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.
JOB.16.16	My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids 
JOB.16.17	Not for 
JOB.16.18	O earth, cover not you
JOB.16.19	Also now, behold, my witness 
JOB.16.20	My friends scorn me: 
JOB.16.21	O that one might plead for a man with God-Elōhīm 
JOB.16.22	When a few years are come, then I shall go the way 
JOB.17.1	My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves 
JOB.17.3	Lay down now, put me in a surety with you
JOB.17.4	For you
JOB.17.5	He that speaks flattery to 
JOB.17.6	He has made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tambourine.
JOB.17.7	Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members 
JOB.17.8	Upright 
JOB.17.9	The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that has clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.
JOB.17.10	But as for you all, do you
JOB.17.11	My days are past, my purposes are broken off, 
JOB.17.12	They change the night into day: the light 
JOB.17.13	If I wait, the grave 
JOB.17.14	I have said to corruption, you
JOB.17.15	And where 
JOB.17.16	They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when 
JOB.18.1	Then answered Bildad 
JOB.18.2	How long 
JOB.18.3	For what reason are we counted as beasts, 
JOB.18.4	He tears himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for you
JOB.18.5	Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.
JOB.18.6	The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.
JOB.18.7	The steps of his strength shall be straightened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.
JOB.18.8	For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walks upon a snare.
JOB.18.9	The trap shall take 
JOB.18.10	The snare 
JOB.18.11	Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.
JOB.18.12	His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction 
JOB.18.13	It shall devour the strength of his skin: 
JOB.18.14	His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.
JOB.18.15	It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because 
JOB.18.16	His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.
JOB.18.17	His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.
JOB.18.18	He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.
JOB.18.19	He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.
JOB.18.20	They that come after 
JOB.18.21	Surely such 
JOB.19.1	Then Iyov 
JOB.19.2	How long will you
JOB.19.3	These ten times have you
JOB.19.4	And be it indeed 
JOB.19.5	If indeed you
JOB.19.6	Know now that God-Elōhīm 
JOB.19.7	Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but 
JOB.19.8	He has fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he has set darkness in my paths.
JOB.19.9	He has stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown 
JOB.19.10	He has destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and my hope has he removed like a tree.
JOB.19.11	He has also kindled his wrath against me, and he counts me unto him as 
JOB.19.12	His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.
JOB.19.13	He has put my brethren far from me, and my acquaintance are truly estranged from me.
JOB.19.14	My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.
JOB.19.15	They that dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.
JOB.19.16	I called my servant, and he gave 
JOB.19.17	My breath is strange to my wife, though I entreated for the children’s 
JOB.19.18	Yes, young children despised me; I arose, and they spoke against me.
JOB.19.19	All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.
JOB.19.20	My bone cleaves to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.
JOB.19.21	Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O you
JOB.19.22	Why do you
JOB.19.23	Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!
JOB.19.24	That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock forever!
JOB.19.25	For I know 
JOB.19.26	And 
JOB.19.27	Whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another; 
JOB.19.28	But you
JOB.19.29	Be you
JOB.20.1	Then answered Tzofar 
JOB.20.2	Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for 
JOB.20.3	I have heard the rebuke 
JOB.20.4	Know you
JOB.20.5	That the triumphing of the wicked 
JOB.20.6	Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;
JOB.20.8	He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yes, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.
JOB.20.9	The eye also 
JOB.20.10	His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.
JOB.20.11	His bones are full 
JOB.20.12	Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, 
JOB.20.15	He has swallow (to approve, commend, accept)ed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God-Elōhīm 
JOB.20.16	He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper’s tongue shall slay him.
JOB.20.17	He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.
JOB.20.18	That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow 
JOB.20.19	Because he has oppressed 
JOB.20.20	Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.
JOB.20.21	There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.
JOB.20.22	In the fullness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.
JOB.20.24	He shall flee from the iron weapon, 
JOB.20.25	It is drawn, and comes out of the body; yes, the glittering sword comes out of his gall 
JOB.20.26	All darkness 
JOB.20.27	The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.
JOB.20.28	The increase of his house shall depart, 
JOB.20.29	This 
JOB.21.1	But Iyov 
JOB.21.2	Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.
JOB.21.3	Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.
JOB.21.4	As for me, 
JOB.21.5	Mark me, and be astonished, and lay 
JOB.21.6	Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling takes hold on my flesh.
JOB.21.7	For what reason do the wicked live, become old, yes, are mighty in power?
JOB.21.8	Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.
JOB.21.9	Their houses 
JOB.21.10	Their bulls are fertile, and fail not; their cow calve, and casts not her calf.
JOB.21.11	They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.
JOB.21.12	They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.
JOB.21.13	They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.
JOB.21.14	Therefore they say unto God-El 
JOB.21.15	What 
JOB.21.16	Lo, their good 
JOB.21.17	How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and 
JOB.21.18	They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carries away.
JOB.21.19	God-Elōhīm 
JOB.21.20	His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
JOB.21.21	For what pleasure 
JOB.21.22	Shall 
JOB.21.23	One dies in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.
JOB.21.24	His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.
JOB.21.25	And another dies in the bitterness of his soul, and never eats with pleasure.
JOB.21.26	They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.
JOB.21.27	Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices 
JOB.21.28	For you
JOB.21.29	Have you
JOB.21.30	That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.
JOB.21.31	Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him 
JOB.21.32	Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.
JOB.21.33	The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as 
JOB.21.34	How then comfort you
JOB.22.1	Then Elifaz 
JOB.22.2	Can a man be profitable unto God-Elōhīm 
JOB.22.4	Will he reprove you
JOB.22.6	For you
JOB.22.7	you
JOB.22.8	But 
JOB.22.9	you
JOB.22.10	Therefore snares 
JOB.22.11	Or darkness, 
JOB.22.13	And you
JOB.22.14	Thick clouds 
JOB.22.15	Have you
JOB.22.16	Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:
JOB.22.17	Which said unto God-El 
JOB.22.18	Yet he filled their houses with good 
JOB.22.19	The righteous see 
JOB.22.20	Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumes.
JOB.22.21	Acquaint now yourself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto you
JOB.22.22	Receive, I pray you
JOB.22.23	If you
JOB.22.24	Then shall you
JOB.22.25	Yes, the Almighty shall be you
JOB.22.26	For then shall you
JOB.22.27	you
JOB.22.28	you
JOB.22.29	When 
JOB.22.30	He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of you
JOB.23.1	Then Iyov 
JOB.23.2	Even today 
JOB.23.3	Oh that I knew where I might find him! 
JOB.23.4	I would order 
JOB.23.5	I would know the words 
JOB.23.6	Will he plead against me with 
JOB.23.7	There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered forever from my judge.
JOB.23.8	Behold, I go forward, but he 
JOB.23.9	On the left hand, where he does work, but I cannot behold 
JOB.23.10	But he knows the way that I take: 
JOB.23.11	My foot has held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.
JOB.23.12	Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary 
JOB.23.13	But he 
JOB.23.14	For he performs 
JOB.23.15	Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.
JOB.23.16	For God-Elōhīm 
JOB.23.17	Because I was not cut off before the darkness, 
JOB.24.1	Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?
JOB.24.3	They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow’s ox for a pledge.
JOB.24.4	They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.
JOB.24.5	Behold, 
JOB.24.6	They reap 
JOB.24.7	They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that 
JOB.24.8	They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for lack of a shelter.
JOB.24.9	They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.
JOB.24.10	They cause 
JOB.24.12	Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded cries out: yet God-Elōhīm 
JOB.24.13	They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.
JOB.24.14	The murderer rising with the light kills the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.
JOB.24.15	The eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguises 
JOB.24.16	In the dark they dig through houses, 
JOB.24.17	For the morning 
JOB.24.18	He 
JOB.24.19	Drought and heat consume the snow waters: 
JOB.24.20	The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.
JOB.24.21	He evil entreats the barren 
JOB.24.22	He draws also the mighty with his power: he rises up, and no 
JOB.24.24	They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all 
JOB.24.25	And if 
JOB.25.1	Then answered Bildad 
JOB.25.2	Dominion and fear 
JOB.25.3	Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom does not his light arise?
JOB.25.4	How then can man be justified with God-Elōhīm 
JOB.25.5	Behold even to the moon, and it shines not; yes, the stars are not pure in his sight.
JOB.25.6	How much less man, 
JOB.26.1	But Job answered and said,
JOB.26.2	How have you
JOB.26.3	How have you
JOB.26.4	To whom have you
JOB.26.5	Dead 
JOB.26.6	Hell 
JOB.26.7	He stretches out the north over the empty place, 
JOB.26.8	He binds up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.
JOB.26.9	He holds back the face of his throne, 
JOB.26.10	He has compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.
JOB.26.11	The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof 
JOB.26.12	He divides the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smites through the proud.
JOB.26.13	By his spirit he has garnished the heavens; his hand has formed the crooked serpent.
JOB.26.14	Lo, these 
JOB.27.1	Moreover Iyov 
JOB.27.3	All the while my breath 
JOB.27.4	My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.
JOB.27.5	God-Elōhīm 
JOB.27.6	My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach 
JOB.27.7	Let my enemy be as the wicked, and he that rises up against me as the unrighteous.
JOB.27.8	For what 
JOB.27.9	Will God-Elōhīm 
JOB.27.10	Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God-Elōhīm 
JOB.27.11	I will teach you by the hand of God-Elōhīm 
JOB.27.12	Behold, all you
JOB.27.13	This 
JOB.27.14	If his children be multiplied, 
JOB.27.15	Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.
JOB.27.16	Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare clothing as the clay;
JOB.27.17	He may prepare 
JOB.27.18	He builds his house as a moth, and as a booth 
JOB.27.19	The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he opens his eyes, and he 
JOB.27.20	Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest steals him away in the night.
JOB.27.21	The east wind carries him away, and he departs: and as a storm hurls him out of his place.
JOB.27.22	For [God-Elōhīm 
JOB.28.1	Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold 
JOB.28.2	Yir’on 
JOB.28.3	He sets an end to darkness, and searches out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.
JOB.28.4	The flood breaks out from the inhabitant; 
JOB.28.6	The stones of it 
JOB.28.8	The lion’s whelps have not trampled it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.
JOB.28.9	He puts forth his hand upon the rock; he overturns the mountains by the roots.
JOB.28.10	He cuts out rivers among the rocks; and his eye sees every precious thing.
JOB.28.11	He binds the floods from overflowing; and 
JOB.28.12	But where shall wisdom be found? and where 
JOB.28.13	Man knows not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.
JOB.28.14	The depth says, It 
JOB.28.15	It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed 
JOB.28.16	It cannot be valued with the gold of Ofir 
JOB.28.17	The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it 
JOB.28.18	No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom 
JOB.28.19	The topaz of Ethiopia 
JOB.28.20	Whence then comes wisdom? and where 
JOB.28.21	Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.
JOB.28.22	Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.
JOB.28.23	God-Elōhīm 
JOB.28.24	For he looks to the ends of the earth, 
JOB.28.25	To make the weight for the winds; and he weighs the waters by measure.
JOB.28.26	When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:
JOB.28.27	Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yes, and searched it out.
JOB.28.28	And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord-Adonai 
JOB.29.1	Moreover Iyov 
JOB.29.2	Oh that I were as 
JOB.29.3	When his candle shined upon my head, 
JOB.29.4	As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God-Elōhīm 
JOB.29.5	When the Almighty 
JOB.29.6	When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;
JOB.29.7	When I went out to the gate through the city, 
JOB.29.8	The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, 
JOB.29.9	The princes refrained talking, and laid 
JOB.29.10	The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
JOB.29.11	When the ear heard 
JOB.29.12	Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and 
JOB.29.13	The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.
JOB.29.14	I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment 
JOB.29.15	I was eyes to the blind, and feet 
JOB.29.16	I 
JOB.29.17	And I broke the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil 
JOB.29.18	Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply 
JOB.29.19	My root 
JOB.29.20	My glory 
JOB.29.21	Unto me 
JOB.29.22	After my words they spoke not again; and my speech dropped upon them.
JOB.29.23	And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide 
JOB.29.25	I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one 
JOB.30.1	But now 
JOB.30.2	Yes, whereto 
JOB.30.3	For lack and famine 
JOB.30.4	Who cut up mallow 
JOB.30.5	They were driven forth from among 
JOB.30.6	To dwell in the clefts of the valleys, 
JOB.30.7	Among the bushes they groan 
JOB.30.9	And now am I their song, yes, I am their byword.
JOB.30.10	They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.
JOB.30.11	Because he has loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.
JOB.30.12	Upon 
JOB.30.13	They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.
JOB.30.14	They came 
JOB.30.15	Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passes away as a cloud.
JOB.30.16	And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
JOB.30.17	My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.
JOB.30.18	By the great force 
JOB.30.19	He has cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.
JOB.30.20	I cry unto you
JOB.30.21	you
JOB.30.22	you
JOB.30.23	For I know 
JOB.30.24	However he will not stretch out 
JOB.30.25	Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was 
JOB.30.26	When I looked for good, then evil came 
JOB.30.27	My bowels 
JOB.30.28	I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, 
JOB.30.29	I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.
JOB.30.30	My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.
JOB.30.31	My harp also is 
JOB.31.1	I made a covenant with my eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?
JOB.31.2	For what portion of God-Elōhīm 
JOB.31.4	Does not he see my ways, and count all my steps?
JOB.31.5	If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot has hasted to deceit;
JOB.31.6	Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God-Elōhīm 
JOB.31.7	If my step has turned out of the way, and my heart walked after my eyes, and if any blot has cleaved to my hands;
JOB.31.9	If my heart have been deceived by a woman, or 
JOB.31.11	For this 
JOB.31.12	For it 
JOB.31.13	If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;
JOB.31.14	What then shall I do when God-Elōhīm 
JOB.31.15	Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?
JOB.31.16	If I have withheld the poor from 
JOB.31.17	Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless has not eaten thereof;
JOB.31.18	(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as 
JOB.31.19	If I have seen any perish for lack of clothing, or any poor without covering;
JOB.31.20	If his waist have not Blessed 
JOB.31.21	If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:
JOB.31.23	For destruction 
JOB.31.24	If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, 
JOB.31.25	If I rejoiced because my wealth 
JOB.31.26	If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking 
JOB.31.27	And my heart has been secretly enticed, or my mouth has kissed my hand:
JOB.31.28	This also 
JOB.31.29	If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:
JOB.31.30	Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
JOB.31.31	If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.
JOB.31.32	The stranger did not lodge in the street: 
JOB.31.33	If I covered my transgressions as Adam (Man, ground; red; earthling), by hiding my iniquity in my bosom:
JOB.31.34	Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, 
JOB.31.35	Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire 
JOB.31.36	Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, 
JOB.31.37	I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.
JOB.31.38	If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;
JOB.31.39	If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:
JOB.31.40	Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle 
JOB.32.1	So these three men ceased to answer Iyov 
JOB.32.2	Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu 
JOB.32.3	Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and 
JOB.32.4	Now Elihu 
JOB.32.5	When Elihu 
JOB.32.6	And Elihu 
JOB.32.7	I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.
JOB.32.8	But 
JOB.32.9	Great men are not 
JOB.32.10	Therefore I said, Listen to me; I also will show my opinion.
JOB.32.11	Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst you
JOB.32.12	Yes, I attended unto you, and, behold, 
JOB.32.13	Lest you
JOB.32.14	Now he has not directed 
JOB.32.15	They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.
JOB.32.16	When I had waited, (for they spoke not, but stood still, 
JOB.32.18	For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constrains me.
JOB.32.19	Behold, my belly 
JOB.32.20	I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.
JOB.32.21	Let me not, I pray you, accept any man’s person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.
JOB.32.22	For I know not to give flattering titles; 
JOB.33.1	For what reason, Iyov 
JOB.33.2	Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue has spoken in my mouth.
JOB.33.3	My words 
JOB.33.4	The Spirit of God-Elōhīm 
JOB.33.5	If you
JOB.33.6	Behold, I 
JOB.33.7	Behold, my terror shall not make you
JOB.33.8	Surely you
JOB.33.9	I am clean without transgression, I 
JOB.33.10	Behold, he finds occasions against me, he counts me for his enemy,
JOB.33.11	He puts my feet in the stocks, he marks all my paths.
JOB.33.12	Behold, 
JOB.33.13	Why do you
JOB.33.14	For God-Elōhīm 
JOB.33.15	In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;
JOB.33.16	Then he opens the ears of men, and seals their instruction,
JOB.33.17	That he may withdraw man 
JOB.33.18	He keeps back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.
JOB.33.19	He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong 
JOB.33.20	So that his life abhors bread, and his soul dainty meat.
JOB.33.21	His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones 
JOB.33.22	Yes, his soul draws near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.
JOB.33.23	If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show unto man his uprightness:
JOB.33.24	Then he is gracious unto him, and says, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.
JOB.33.25	His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to the days of his youth:
JOB.33.26	He shall pray unto God-Elōhīm 
JOB.33.27	He looks upon men, and 
JOB.33.28	He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.
JOB.33.29	Lo, all these 
JOB.33.30	To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.
JOB.33.31	Mark well, O Iyov 
JOB.33.32	If you
JOB.33.33	If not, hearken unto me: hold you
JOB.34.1	Furthermore Elihu 
JOB.34.2	Hear my words, O you
JOB.34.3	For the ear tries words, as the mouth tastes meat.
JOB.34.4	Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what 
JOB.34.5	For Iyov 
JOB.34.6	Should I lie against my right? my wound 
JOB.34.7	What man 
JOB.34.8	Which goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and walks with wicked men.
JOB.34.9	For he has said, It profits a man nothing that he should delight himself with God-Elōhīm 
JOB.34.10	Therefore hearken unto me, you
JOB.34.11	For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to 
JOB.34.12	Yes, surely God-Elōhīm 
JOB.34.13	Who has given him a charge over the earth? or who has disposed the whole world?
JOB.34.14	If he set his heart upon man, 
JOB.34.15	All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.
JOB.34.16	If now 
JOB.34.17	Shall even he that hates right govern? and will you
JOB.34.20	In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
JOB.34.21	For his eyes 
JOB.34.23	For he will not lay upon man more 
JOB.34.24	He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.
JOB.34.25	Therefore he knows their works, and he overturns 
JOB.34.26	He strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
JOB.34.27	Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:
JOB.34.28	So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he hears the cry of the afflicted.
JOB.34.29	When he gives quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hides 
JOB.34.30	That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.
JOB.34.31	Surely it is meet to be said unto God-Elōhīm 
JOB.34.34	Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.
JOB.34.35	Iyov 
JOB.34.36	My desire 
JOB.34.37	For he adds rebellion unto his sin, he claps 
JOB.35.1	Elihu 
JOB.35.2	Think you
JOB.35.3	For you
JOB.35.4	I will answer you
JOB.35.5	Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds 
JOB.35.6	If you
JOB.35.7	If you
JOB.35.8	You
JOB.35.9	By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make 
JOB.35.10	But none says, Where 
JOB.35.11	Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth, and makes us wiser than the fowls of heaven?
JOB.35.12	There they cry, but none gives answer, because of the pride of evil men.
JOB.35.13	Surely God-Elōhīm 
JOB.35.14	Although you
JOB.35.15	But now, because 
JOB.35.16	Therefore does Iyov 
JOB.36.1	Elihu 
JOB.36.2	Suffer me a little, and I will show you
JOB.36.3	I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
JOB.36.4	For truly my words 
JOB.36.5	Behold, God-Elōhīm 
JOB.36.6	He preserves not the life of the wicked: but gives right to the poor.
JOB.36.7	He withdraws not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings 
JOB.36.8	And if 
JOB.36.9	Then he shows them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.
JOB.36.10	He opens also their ear to discipline, and commands that they return from iniquity.
JOB.36.11	If they obey and serve 
JOB.36.12	But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.
JOB.36.13	But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he binds them.
JOB.36.14	They die in youth, and their life 
JOB.36.15	He delivers the poor in his affliction, and opens their ears in oppression.
JOB.36.16	Even so would he have removed you
JOB.36.17	But you
JOB.36.18	Because 
JOB.36.19	Will he esteem you
JOB.36.20	Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.
JOB.36.21	Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this have you
JOB.36.22	Behold, God-Elōhīm 
JOB.36.23	Who has enjoined him his way? or who can say, you
JOB.36.24	Remember that you
JOB.36.25	Every man may see it; man may behold 
JOB.36.26	Behold, God-Elōhīm 
JOB.36.27	For he makes small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:
JOB.36.28	Which the clouds do drop 
JOB.36.29	Also can 
JOB.36.30	Behold, he spreads his light upon it, and covers the bottom of the sea.
JOB.36.31	For by them he the people; he gives meat in abundance.
JOB.36.32	With clouds he covers the light; and commands it 
JOB.36.33	The noise thereof shows concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.
JOB.37.1	At this also my heart trembles, and is moved out of his place.
JOB.37.2	Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound 
JOB.37.3	He directs it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.
JOB.37.4	After it a voice roars: he thunders with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.
JOB.37.5	God-Elōhīm 
JOB.37.6	For he says to the snow, Be you
JOB.37.7	He seals up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.
JOB.37.8	Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.
JOB.37.9	Out of the south comes the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.
JOB.37.10	By the breath of God-Elōhīm 
JOB.37.11	Also by watering he wears the thick cloud: he scatters his bright cloud:
JOB.37.12	And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commands them upon the face of the world in the earth.
JOB.37.13	He causes it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.
JOB.37.14	Listen unto this, O Iyov 
JOB.37.15	Do you
JOB.37.16	Do you
JOB.37.17	How you
JOB.37.18	Have you
JOB.37.19	Teach us what we shall say unto him; 
JOB.37.20	Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallow 
JOB.37.21	And now 
JOB.37.22	Fair weather comes out of the north: with God-Elōhīm 
JOB.37.24	Men do therefore fear him: he respects not any 
JOB.38.1	Then the 
JOB.38.2	Who 
JOB.38.3	Gird up now you
JOB.38.4	Where were you
JOB.38.5	Who has laid the measures thereof, if you
JOB.38.6	Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;
JOB.38.7	When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God-Elōhīm 
JOB.38.8	Or 
JOB.38.9	When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddling clothes 
JOB.38.10	And broke up for it my decreed 
JOB.38.11	And said, Till this point in time shall you
JOB.38.12	Have you
JOB.38.13	That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?
JOB.38.14	It is turned as clay 
JOB.38.15	And from the wicked their light is withheld, and the high arm shall be broken.
JOB.38.16	Have you
JOB.38.17	Have the gates of death been opened unto you
JOB.38.18	Have you
JOB.38.19	Where 
JOB.38.20	That you
JOB.38.21	Know you
JOB.38.22	Have you
JOB.38.23	Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?
JOB.38.24	By what way is the light parted, 
JOB.38.25	Who has divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;
JOB.38.26	To cause it to rain on the earth, 
JOB.38.27	To satisfy the desolate and waste 
JOB.38.28	Has the rain a father? or who has begotten the drops of dew?
JOB.38.29	Out of whose womb came the ice? and the white colored 
JOB.38.30	The waters are hid as 
JOB.38.31	Can you
JOB.38.32	Can you
JOB.38.33	Know you
JOB.38.34	Can you
JOB.38.35	Can you
JOB.38.36	Who has put wisdom in the inward parts? or who has given understanding to the heart?
JOB.38.37	Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,
JOB.38.38	When the dust grows into hardness, and the clods cleave 
JOB.38.39	Will you
JOB.38.40	When they couch in 
JOB.38.41	Who provides for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God-Elōhīm 
JOB.39.1	Know you
JOB.39.2	Can you
JOB.39.3	They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.
JOB.39.4	Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.
JOB.39.5	Who has sent out the wild ass free? or who has loosed the bands of the wild ass?
JOB.39.6	Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.
JOB.39.7	He scorns the multitude of the city, neither regards he the crying of the driver.
JOB.39.8	The range of the mountains 
JOB.39.9	Will the unicorn be willing to serve you
JOB.39.10	Can you
JOB.39.11	Will you
JOB.39.12	Will you
JOB.39.14	Which leaves her eggs in the earth, and warms them in dust,
JOB.39.15	And forgets that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.
JOB.39.16	She is hardened against her young ones, as though 
JOB.39.17	Because God-Elōhīm 
JOB.39.18	What time she lifts up herself on high, she scorns the horse and his rider.
JOB.39.19	Have you
JOB.39.20	Can you
JOB.39.21	He paws in the valley, and rejoices in 
JOB.39.22	He mocks at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turns he back from the sword.
JOB.39.23	The quiver rattles against him, the glittering spear and the shield.
JOB.39.24	He swallow (to approve, commend, accept)s the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that 
JOB.39.25	He says among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smells the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
JOB.39.26	Does the hawk fly by you
JOB.39.27	Does the eagle mount up at you
JOB.39.28	She dwells and abides on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.
JOB.39.29	From there she seeks the prey, 
JOB.39.30	Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain 
JOB.40.1	Moreover the 
JOB.40.2	Shall he that contends with the Almighty instruct 
JOB.40.3	Then Iyov 
JOB.40.4	Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer you
JOB.40.5	Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yes, twice; but I will proceed no further.
JOB.40.6	Then answered the 
JOB.40.7	Gird up you
JOB.40.8	Will you
JOB.40.9	Have you
JOB.40.10	Deck yourself now 
JOB.40.11	Cast abroad the rage of you
JOB.40.12	Look on every one 
JOB.40.13	Hide them in the dust together; 
JOB.40.14	Then will I also confess unto you
JOB.40.15	Behold now Behemoth 
JOB.40.16	Lo now, his strength 
JOB.40.17	He moves his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.
JOB.40.18	His bones 
JOB.40.19	He 
JOB.40.20	Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.
JOB.40.21	He lies under the shady trees, in the colonnade of the reed, and fens.
JOB.40.22	The shady trees cover him 
JOB.40.23	Behold, he drink up a river, 
JOB.40.24	He takes it with his eyes: 
JOB.41.1	Can you
JOB.41.2	Can you
JOB.41.3	Will he make many supplications unto you
JOB.41.4	Will he make a covenant with you
JOB.41.5	Will you
JOB.41.6	Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?
JOB.41.7	Can you
JOB.41.8	Lay you
JOB.41.9	Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not 
JOB.41.10	None 
JOB.41.11	Who has prevented me, that I should repay 
JOB.41.12	I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely 
JOB.41.13	Who can discover 
JOB.41.14	Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth 
JOB.41.16	One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.
JOB.41.17	They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.
JOB.41.18	By his snortings a light does shine, and his eyes 
JOB.41.19	Out of his mouth go burning lamps, 
JOB.41.20	Out of his nostrils goes smoke, as 
JOB.41.21	His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth.
JOB.41.22	In his neck remains strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.
JOB.41.23	The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.
JOB.41.24	His heart is as firm as a stone; yes, as hard as a piece of the lower 
JOB.41.25	When he raises up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.
JOB.41.26	The sword of him that lays at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon 
JOB.41.27	He esteems iron as straw, 
JOB.41.28	The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.
JOB.41.29	Darts are counted as stubble: he laughs at the shaking of a spear.
JOB.41.30	Sharp stones 
JOB.41.31	He makes the deep to boil like a pot: he makes the sea like a pot of ointment.
JOB.41.32	He makes a path to shine after him; 
JOB.41.33	Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.
JOB.41.34	He beholds all high 
JOB.42.1	Then Iyov 
JOB.42.2	I know that you
JOB.42.3	Who 
JOB.42.4	Hear, I beseech 
JOB.42.5	I have heard of you
JOB.42.6	For what reason I abhor 
JOB.42.7	And it was 
JOB.42.8	Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Iyov 
JOB.42.9	So Elifaz [my God is 
JOB.42.10	And the 
JOB.42.11	Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the 
JOB.42.12	So the 
JOB.42.13	He had also seven sons and three daughters.
JOB.42.14	And he called the name of the first, Y’mimah 
JOB.42.15	And in all the land were no women found 
JOB.42.16	After this lived Iyov 
JOB.42.17	So Iyov 
SNG.1.1	The song of songs, which 
SNG.1.2	Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for you
SNG.1.3	Because of the savour of you
SNG.1.4	Draw me, we will run after you
SNG.1.5	I 
SNG.1.6	Look not upon me, because I 
SNG.1.7	Tell me, O you
SNG.1.8	If you
SNG.1.9	I have compared you
SNG.1.10	Your
SNG.1.11	We will make your
SNG.1.12	While the king 
SNG.1.13	A bundle of myrrh 
SNG.1.14	My beloved 
SNG.1.15	Behold, you
SNG.1.16	Behold, you
SNG.1.17	The beams of our house 
SNG.2.1	I 
SNG.2.2	As the lily among thorns, so 
SNG.2.3	As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so 
SNG.2.4	He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me 
SNG.2.5	Stay me with raisin cakes, comfort me with apples: for I 
SNG.2.6	His left hand 
SNG.2.7	I charge you, O you
SNG.2.8	The voice of my beloved! behold, he comes leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.
SNG.2.9	My beloved is like a roe or a young deer: behold, he stands behind our wall, he looks forth at the windows, showing himself through the lattice.
SNG.2.10	My beloved spoke, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.
SNG.2.11	For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over 
SNG.2.12	The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing 
SNG.2.13	The fig tree puts forth her green figs, and the vines 
SNG.2.14	O my dove, 
SNG.2.15	Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil 
SNG.2.16	My beloved 
SNG.2.17	Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be you
SNG.3.1	By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I found him not.
SNG.3.2	I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I found him not.
SNG.3.3	The watchmen that go about the city found me: 
SNG.3.5	I charge you, O you
SNG.3.6	Who 
SNG.3.7	Behold his bed, which 
SNG.3.8	They all hold swords, 
SNG.3.9	King Shlomo 
SNG.3.10	He made the pillars thereof 
SNG.3.11	Go forth, O you
SNG.4.1	Behold, you
SNG.4.2	You
SNG.4.3	You
SNG.4.4	You
SNG.4.5	You
SNG.4.6	Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.
SNG.4.7	you
SNG.4.8	Come with me from L’vanon 
SNG.4.9	you
SNG.4.10	How fair is you
SNG.4.11	You
SNG.4.12	A garden enclosed 
SNG.4.13	Your
SNG.4.14	Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices
SNG.4.15	A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from L’vanon 
SNG.4.16	Awake, O north wind; and come, you
SNG.5.1	I am come into my garden, my sister, 
SNG.5.2	I sleep, but my heart wakes: 
SNG.5.3	I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?
SNG.5.4	My beloved put in his hand by the hole 
SNG.5.5	I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped 
SNG.5.6	I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, 
SNG.5.7	The watchmen that went about the city found me, they struck me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.
SNG.5.8	I charge you, O daughters of Yerushalayim 
SNG.5.9	What

SNG.6.2	My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
SNG.6.3	I 
SNG.6.4	you

SNG.6.10	Who 
SNG.6.11	I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley,

SNG.8.7	Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if 
SNG.8.8	We have a little sister, and she has no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?

RUT.1.2	And the name of the man 
RUT.1.3	And Eli-Melekh 
RUT.1.4	And they took them wives of the women of Mo’av 
RUT.1.5	And Machlon 
RUT.1.6	Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Mo’av 
RUT.1.7	For what reason she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Y’hudah

RUT.1.19	So they two went until they came to Beit-Lechem 
RUT.1.20	And she said unto them, Call me not Na’omi 
RUT.1.21	I went out full, and the 
RUT.1.22	So Na’omi

RUT.2.4	And, behold, Bo’az 
RUT.2.5	Then said Bo’az 
RUT.2.6	And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It 
RUT.2.7	And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.
RUT.2.8	Then said Bo’az 
RUT.2.10	Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in you

LAM.1.1	How does the city sit solitary, 
LAM.1.2	She weep sore in the night, and her tears 
LAM.1.3	Y’hudah 
LAM.1.4	The ways of Tziyon 
LAM.1.5	Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the

LAM.1.7	Yerushalayim 
LAM.1.8	Yerushalayim 
LAM.1.9	Her filthiness 
LAM.1.10	The adversary has spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she has seen 
LAM.1.11	All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O 
LAM.1.13	From above has he sent fire into my bones, and it prevails against them: he has spread a net for my feet, he has turned me back: he has made me desolate 
LAM.1.14	The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, 
LAM.1.15	The Lord-Adonai 
LAM.1.16	For these 
LAM.1.17	Tziyon 
LAM.1.18	The

LAM.2.1	How has the Lord-Adonai 
LAM.2.2	The Lord-Adonai 
LAM.2.3	He has cut off in

LAM.3.6	He has set me in dark places, as 
LAM.3.7	He has hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he has made my chain heavy.
LAM.3.8	Also when I cry and shout, he shuts out my prayer.
LAM.3.9	He has enclosed my ways with cut stone, he has made my paths crooked.
LAM.3.10	He 
LAM.3.11	He has turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he has made me desolate.
LAM.3.12	He has bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.
LAM.3.13	He has caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins 
LAM.3.14	I was a ridicule (laughing at enemies’ threats) to all my people; 
LAM.3.15	He has filled me with bitterness, he has made me drunken with wormwood.
LAM.3.16	He has also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he has covered me with ashes.
LAM.3.17	And you
LAM.3.18	And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the 
LAM.3.19	Remembering my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall 
LAM.3.20	My soul has 
LAM.3.21	This I recall to 
LAM.3.24	The 
LAM.3.25	The 
LAM.3.28	He sits alone and keeps silence, because he has borne 
LAM.3.29	He puts his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.
LAM.3.30	He gives 
LAM.3.31	For the Lord-Adonai 
LAM.3.32	But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.
LAM.3.33	For he does not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.
LAM.3.34	To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,
LAM.3.35	To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,
LAM.3.36	To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord-Adonai 
LAM.3.37	Who 
LAM.3.38	Out of the mouth of the most High proceeds not evil and good?
LAM.3.39	For what reason does a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?
LAM.3.40	Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the 
LAM.3.41	Let us lift up our heart with 
LAM.3.42	We have transgressed and have rebelled: you
LAM.3.43	you
LAM.3.44	you
LAM.3.45	you
LAM.3.46	All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.
LAM.3.47	Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.
LAM.3.48	Mine eye runs down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
LAM.3.49	Mine eye trickles down, and ceases not, without any intermission,
LAM.3.50	Till the 
LAM.3.51	Mine eye affects my heart because of all the daughters of my city.
LAM.3.52	Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.
LAM.3.53	They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.
LAM.3.54	Waters flowed over my head; 
LAM.3.55	I called upon you
LAM.3.56	you
LAM.3.57	you
LAM.3.58	O Lord-Adonai 
LAM.3.59	O 
LAM.3.60	you
LAM.3.61	you
LAM.3.62	The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.
LAM.3.63	Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I 
LAM.3.64	Render unto them a recompense, O 
LAM.3.65	Give them sorrow of heart, you
LAM.3.66	Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the 
LAM.4.1	How is the gold become dim! 
LAM.4.2	The precious sons of Tziyon 
LAM.4.3	Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people 
LAM.4.4	The tongue of the sucking child cleaves to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, 
LAM.4.5	They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.
LAM.4.6	For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of S’dom 
LAM.4.7	Her N’zirim 
LAM.4.8	Their visage 
LAM.4.10	The hands of the pitiful women have coocked 
LAM.4.11	The 
LAM.4.12	The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Yerushalayim 
LAM.4.13	For the sins of her prophets, 
LAM.4.14	They have wandered 
LAM.4.15	They cried unto them, Depart you
LAM.4.16	The anger of the 
LAM.4.17	As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation 
LAM.4.18	They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.
LAM.4.19	Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.
LAM.4.20	The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the 
LAM.4.21	Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom 
LAM.4.22	The punishment of you
LAM.5.1	Remember, O 
LAM.5.2	Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.
LAM.5.3	We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers 
LAM.5.4	We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.
LAM.5.5	Our necks 
LAM.5.6	We have given the hand 
LAM.5.7	Our fathers have sinned, 
LAM.5.8	Servants have ruled over us: 
LAM.5.9	We got our bread with 
LAM.5.10	Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.
LAM.5.11	They ravished the women in Tziyon 
LAM.5.12	Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured.
LAM.5.13	They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.
LAM.5.14	The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their music.
LAM.5.15	The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.
LAM.5.16	The crown is fallen 
LAM.5.17	For this our heart is faint; for these 
LAM.5.18	Because of the mountain of Tziyon 
LAM.5.19	you
LAM.5.20	For what reason do you
LAM.5.21	Turn you
LAM.5.22	But you
ECC.1.1	The words of the Preacher, the son of David 
ECC.1.2	Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all 
ECC.1.3	What profit has a man of all his labour which he takes under the sun?
ECC.1.5	The sun also arises, and the sun goes down, and hastes to his place where he arose.
ECC.1.6	The wind goes toward the south, and turns about unto the north; it whirls about continually, and the wind returns again according to his circuits.
ECC.1.7	All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea 
ECC.1.8	All things 
ECC.1.9	The thing that has been, it 
ECC.1.10	Is there 
ECC.1.12	I the Preacher was king over Yisra’el 
ECC.1.13	And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all 
ECC.1.14	I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all 
ECC.1.16	I communed with my own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all 
ECC.1.17	And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is anguish of spirit.
ECC.1.18	For in much wisdom 
ECC.2.1	I said in my heart, Go to now, I will prove you
ECC.2.2	I said of laughter, 
ECC.2.3	I sought in my heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting my heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what 
ECC.2.4	I made me great works; I built me houses; I planted me vineyards:
ECC.2.5	I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all 
ECC.2.6	I made me pools of water, to water with that the wood that brings forth trees:
ECC.2.7	I got 
ECC.2.8	I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar 
ECC.2.9	So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Yerushalayim 
ECC.2.10	And whatsoever my eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.
ECC.2.11	Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all 
ECC.2.12	And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what 
ECC.2.13	Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness.
ECC.2.14	The wise man’s eyes 
ECC.2.15	Then said I in my heart, As it happens to the fool, so it happens even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also 
ECC.2.16	For 
ECC.2.17	Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun 
ECC.2.18	Yes, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.
ECC.2.19	And who knows whether he shall be a wise 
ECC.2.20	Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.
ECC.2.21	For there is a man whose labour 
ECC.2.22	For what has man of all his labour, and of the anguish of his heart, wherein he has laboured under the sun?
ECC.2.23	For all his days 
ECC.2.25	For who can eat, or who else can hasten 
ECC.2.26	For [God-Elōhīm 
ECC.3.1	To every 
ECC.3.2	A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up 
ECC.3.3	A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
ECC.3.4	A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
ECC.3.5	A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
ECC.3.6	A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
ECC.3.7	A time to rend 
ECC.3.8	A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.
ECC.3.9	What profit has he that works in that wherein he laboureth?
ECC.3.10	I have seen the travail, which God-Elōhīm 
ECC.3.11	He has made every 
ECC.3.12	I know that 
ECC.3.13	And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it 
ECC.3.14	I know that, whatsoever God-Elōhīm 
ECC.3.15	That which has been is now; and that which is to be has already been; and God-Elōhīm 
ECC.3.16	And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, 
ECC.3.17	I said in my heart, God-Elōhīm 
ECC.3.18	I said in my heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God-Elōhīm 
ECC.3.19	For that which befalls the sons of men befalls beasts; even one thing befalls them: as the one dies, so dies the other; yes, they have all one breath; so that a man has no preeminence above a beast: for all 
ECC.3.20	All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
ECC.3.21	Who knows the spirit of man that goes upward, and the spirit of the beast that goes downward to the earth?
ECC.3.22	For what reason I perceive that 
ECC.4.1	So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of 
ECC.4.2	For what reason I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.
ECC.4.3	Yes, better 
ECC.4.4	Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This 
ECC.4.5	The fool folds his hands together, and eats his own flesh.
ECC.4.6	Better 
ECC.4.7	Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.
ECC.4.8	There is one 
ECC.4.9	Two 
ECC.4.10	For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him 
ECC.4.11	Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm 
ECC.4.12	And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
ECC.4.13	Better 
ECC.4.14	For out of prison he comes to reign; whereas also 
ECC.4.15	I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.
ECC.5.1	Keep you
ECC.5.2	Be not rash with you
ECC.5.3	For a dream comes through the multitude of business; and a fool’s voice 
ECC.5.4	When you
ECC.5.5	Better 
ECC.5.6	Suffer not you
ECC.5.7	For in the multitude of dreams and many words 
ECC.5.8	If you
ECC.5.9	Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king 
ECC.5.10	He that loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loves abundance with increase: this 
ECC.5.11	When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good 
ECC.5.12	The sleep of a labouring man 
ECC.5.13	There is a sore evil 
ECC.5.14	But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begets a son, and 
ECC.5.15	As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.
ECC.5.16	And this also 
ECC.5.17	All his days also he eats in darkness, and 
ECC.5.18	Behold 
ECC.5.19	Every man also to whom God-Elōhīm 
ECC.5.20	For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God-Elōhīm 
ECC.6.1	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it 
ECC.6.2	A man to whom God-Elōhīm 
ECC.6.3	If a man beget 
ECC.6.4	For he comes in with vanity, and departs in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.
ECC.6.5	Moreover he has not seen the sun, nor known 
ECC.6.6	Yes, though he live a thousand years twice 
ECC.6.7	All the labour of man 
ECC.6.8	For what has the wise more than the fool? what has the poor, that knows to walk before the living?
ECC.6.9	Better 
ECC.6.10	That which has been is named already, and it is known that it 
ECC.6.11	Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what 
ECC.6.12	For who knows what 
ECC.7.1	A good name 
ECC.7.3	Sorrow 
ECC.7.4	The heart of the wise 
ECC.7.6	For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so 
ECC.7.7	Surely oppression makes a wise man mad; and a gift destroys the heart.
ECC.7.8	Better 
ECC.7.9	Be not hasty in you
ECC.7.10	Say not you
ECC.7.11	Wisdom 
ECC.7.12	For wisdom 
ECC.7.13	Consider the work of God-Elōhīm 
ECC.7.14	In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God-Elōhīm 
ECC.7.15	All 
ECC.7.16	Be not righteous over much; neither make yourself over wise: why should you
ECC.7.17	Be not over much wicked, neither be you
ECC.7.19	Wisdom strengthens the wise more than ten mighty 
ECC.7.20	For 
ECC.7.21	Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest you
ECC.7.22	For oftentimes also you
ECC.7.23	All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it 
ECC.7.24	That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?
ECC.7.25	I applied my heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason 
ECC.7.26	And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart 
ECC.7.27	Behold, this have I found, says the preacher, 
ECC.7.28	Which yet my soul seeks, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.
ECC.7.29	Lo, this only have I found, that God-Elōhīm 
ECC.8.1	Who 
ECC.8.2	I 
ECC.8.3	Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he does whatsoever pleases him.
ECC.8.4	Where the word of a king 
ECC.8.5	Whoso keeps the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man’s heart discerns both time and judgment.
ECC.8.6	Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man 
ECC.8.7	For he knows not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?
ECC.8.9	All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: 
ECC.8.10	And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this 
ECC.8.11	Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.
ECC.8.12	Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his 
ECC.8.13	But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong 
ECC.8.14	There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just 
ECC.8.15	Then I commended gladness, because a man has no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God-Elōhīm 
ECC.8.16	When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth (for also 
ECC.8.17	Then I beheld all the work of God-Elōhīm 
ECC.9.1	For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, 
ECC.9.2	All 
ECC.9.3	This 
ECC.9.4	For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
ECC.9.5	For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not anything, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.
ECC.9.6	Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion forever in any 
ECC.9.7	Go you
ECC.9.8	Let you
ECC.9.9	Live joyfully with the wife whom you
ECC.9.10	Whatsoever you
ECC.9.11	I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race 
ECC.9.12	For man also knows not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so 
ECC.9.13	This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it 
ECC.9.15	Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.
ECC.9.16	Then said I, Wisdom 
ECC.9.17	The words of wise 
ECC.9.18	Wisdom 
ECC.10.1	Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: 
ECC.10.2	A wise man’s heart 
ECC.10.3	Yes also, when he that is a fool walks by the way, his wisdom fails 
ECC.10.4	If the spirit of the ruler rise up against you
ECC.10.5	There is an evil 
ECC.10.6	Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.
ECC.10.7	I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.
ECC.10.8	He that digs a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaks an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.
ECC.10.9	Whoso removes stones shall be hurt with that; 
ECC.10.10	If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom 
ECC.10.11	Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.
ECC.10.12	The words of a wise man’s mouth 
ECC.10.13	The beginning of the words of his mouth 
ECC.10.14	A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?
ECC.10.15	The labour of the foolish wears every one of them, because he knows not how to go to the city.
ECC.10.16	Woe to you
ECC.10.17	Blessed 
ECC.10.18	By much slothfulness the building decays; and through idleness of the hands the house drops through.
ECC.10.19	A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes merry: but money answer all 
ECC.10.20	Curse not the king, no not in you
ECC.11.1	Cast you
ECC.11.2	Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for you
ECC.11.3	If the clouds be full of rain, they empty 
ECC.11.4	He that observes the wind shall not sow; and he that regards the clouds shall not reap.
ECC.11.5	As you
ECC.11.6	In the morning sow you
ECC.11.7	Truly the light 
ECC.11.8	But if a man live many years, 
ECC.11.9	Rejoice, O young man, in you
ECC.11.10	Therefore remove sorrow from you
ECC.12.1	Remember now you
ECC.12.2	While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:
ECC.12.3	In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,
ECC.12.4	And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low;
ECC.12.5	Also 
ECC.12.6	Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.
ECC.12.7	Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God-Elōhīm 
ECC.12.8	Vanity of vanities, says the preacher; all 
ECC.12.9	And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yes, he gave good heed, and sought out, 
ECC.12.10	The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and 
ECC.12.11	The words of the wise 
ECC.12.12	And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books 
ECC.12.13	Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God-Elōhīm 
ECC.12.14	For God-Elōhīm 
EST.1.1	Now it came to pass in the days of Achashverosh 
EST.1.3	In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Paras 
EST.1.4	When he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, 
EST.1.5	And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan 
EST.1.7	And they gave 
EST.1.8	And the drinking 
EST.1.9	Also Vashti 
EST.1.10	On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman 
EST.1.11	To bring Vashti 
EST.1.12	But the queen Vashti 
EST.1.13	Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so 
EST.1.14	And the next unto him 
EST.1.15	What shall we do unto the queen Vashti 
EST.1.16	And Memukhan 
EST.1.17	For 
EST.1.19	If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes 
EST.1.20	And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, 
EST.1.21	And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memukhan 
EST.1.22	For he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that 
EST.2.1	After these things, when the wrath of king Achashverosh 
EST.2.2	Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:
EST.2.3	And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan 
EST.2.4	And let the virgin which pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti 
EST.2.6	Who had been carried away from Yerushalayim 
EST.2.7	And he brought up Hadassah, that 
EST.2.8	So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan 
EST.2.9	And the virgin pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, 
EST.2.10	Ester 
EST.2.11	And Mordekhai 
EST.2.12	Now when every maid’s turn was come to go in to king Achashverosh 
EST.2.13	Then thus came 
EST.2.14	In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Sha’ashgaz 
EST.2.15	Now when the turn of Ester 
EST.2.16	So Ester 
EST.2.17	And the king loved Ester 
EST.2.18	Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, 
EST.2.19	And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordekhai 
EST.2.20	Ester 
EST.2.21	In those days, while Mordekhai 
EST.2.22	And the thing was known to Mordekhai 
EST.2.23	And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.
EST.3.1	After these things did king Achashverosh 
EST.3.2	And all the king’s servants, that 
EST.3.3	Then the king’s servants, which 
EST.3.4	Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily unto him, and he listened not unto them, that they told Haman 
EST.3.5	And when Haman 
EST.3.6	And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordekhai 
EST.3.7	In the first month, that 
EST.3.8	And Haman 
EST.3.9	If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring 
EST.3.10	And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman 
EST.3.11	And the king said unto Haman 
EST.3.12	Then were the king’s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman 
EST.3.13	And the letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Y’hudim 
EST.3.14	The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day.
EST.3.15	The posts went out, being hastened by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan 
EST.4.1	When Mordekhai 
EST.4.2	And came even before the king’s gate: for none 
EST.4.3	And in every province, to wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came, 
EST.4.4	So Ester 
EST.4.5	Then called Ester 
EST.4.6	So Hatakh 
EST.4.7	And Mordekhai 
EST.4.8	Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan 
EST.4.9	And Hatakh 
EST.4.10	Again Ester 
EST.4.11	All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, 
EST.4.12	And they told to Mordekhai 
EST.4.13	Then Mordekhai 
EST.4.14	For if you
EST.4.15	Then Ester 
EST.4.16	Go, gather together all the Y’hudim 
EST.4.17	So Mordekhai 
EST.5.1	Now it came to pass on the third day, that Ester 
EST.5.2	And it was so, when the king saw Ester 
EST.5.3	Then said the king unto her, What will you
EST.5.4	And Ester 
EST.5.5	Then the king said, Cause Haman 
EST.5.6	And the king said unto Ester 
EST.5.7	Then answered Ester 
EST.5.8	If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman 
EST.5.9	Then went Haman 
EST.5.10	Nevertheless Haman 
EST.5.11	And Haman 
EST.5.12	Haman 
EST.5.13	Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordekhai 
EST.5.14	Then said Zeresh 
EST.6.1	On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.
EST.6.2	And it was found written, that Mordekhai 
EST.6.3	And the king said, What honour and dignity has been done to Mordekhai 
EST.6.4	And the king said, Who 
EST.6.5	And the king’s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman 
EST.6.6	So Haman 
EST.6.7	And Haman 
EST.6.8	Let the royal apparel be brought which the king 
EST.6.9	And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array 
EST.6.10	Then the king said to Haman 
EST.6.11	Then took Haman 
EST.6.12	And Mordekhai 
EST.6.13	And Haman 
EST.6.14	And while they 
EST.7.1	So the king and Haman 
EST.7.2	And the king said again unto Ester 
EST.7.3	Then Ester 
EST.7.4	For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail 
EST.7.5	Then the king Achashverosh 
EST.7.6	And Ester 
EST.7.7	And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath 
EST.7.8	Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman 
EST.7.9	And Harvonah 
EST.7.10	So they hanged Haman 
EST.8.1	On that day did the king Achashverosh 
EST.8.2	And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman 
EST.8.3	And Ester 
EST.8.4	Then the king held out the golden scepter toward Ester 
EST.8.5	And said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing 
EST.8.6	For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my family?
EST.8.7	Then the king Achashverosh 
EST.8.8	Write you
EST.8.9	Then were the king’s scribes called at that time in the third month, that 
EST.8.10	And he wrote in the king Achashverosh 
EST.8.11	Wherein the king granted the Y’hudim 
EST.8.12	Upon one day in all the provinces of king Achashverosh 
EST.8.13	The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province 
EST.8.15	And Mordekhai 
EST.8.16	The Y’hudim 
EST.8.17	And in every province, and in every city, to wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came, the Y’hudim 
EST.9.1	Now in the twelfth month, that 
EST.9.2	The Y’hudim 
EST.9.3	And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Y’hudim 
EST.9.4	For Mordekhai 
EST.9.5	Thus the Y’hudim 
EST.9.6	And in Shushan 
EST.9.7	And Parshandata 
EST.9.8	And Porata 
EST.9.9	And Parmashta 
EST.9.10	The ten sons of Haman 
EST.9.11	On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan 
EST.9.12	And the king said unto Ester 
EST.9.13	Then said Ester 
EST.9.14	And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan 
EST.9.15	For the Y’hudim 
EST.9.16	But the other Y’hudim 
EST.9.17	On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
EST.9.18	But the Y’hudim 
EST.9.19	Therefore the Y’hudim 
EST.9.20	And Mordekhai 
EST.9.21	To establish 
EST.9.22	As the days wherein the Y’hudim 
EST.9.23	And the Y’hudim 
EST.9.24	Because Haman 
EST.9.25	But when [Ester 
EST.9.26	For what reason they called these days Purim after the name of Pur 
EST.9.27	The Y’hudim 
EST.9.28	And 
EST.9.29	Then Ester 
EST.9.30	And he sent the letters unto all the Y’hudim 
EST.9.31	To confirm these days of Purim in their times 
EST.9.32	And the decree of Ester 
EST.10.1	And the king Achashverosh 
EST.10.2	And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordekhai 
EST.10.3	For Mordekhai 
DAN.1.1	In the third year of the reign of Y’hoyakim king of Y’hudah 
DAN.1.2	And the Lord-Adonai 
DAN.1.3	And the king spoke unto Ashp’naz 
DAN.1.4	Children in whom 
DAN.1.5	And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.
DAN.1.6	Now among these were of the children of Y’hudah 
DAN.1.7	Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Dani’el 
DAN.1.8	But Dani’el 
DAN.1.9	Now God-Elōhīm 
DAN.1.10	And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Dani’el 
DAN.1.11	Then said Dani’el 
DAN.1.12	Prove you
DAN.1.13	Then let our countenances be looked upon before you
DAN.1.14	So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.
DAN.1.15	And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king’s meat.
DAN.1.16	Thus the guard took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse 
DAN.1.17	As for these four children, God-Elōhīm 
DAN.1.18	Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before N’vukhadnetzar.
DAN.1.19	And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Dani’el 
DAN.1.20	And in all matters of wisdom 
DAN.1.21	And Dani’el 
DAN.2.1	And in the second year of the reign of N’vukhadnetzar 
DAN.2.2	Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Kasdim 
DAN.2.3	And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.
DAN.2.4	Then spoke the Kasdim 
DAN.2.5	The king answered and said to the Kasdim 
DAN.2.6	But if you
DAN.2.7	They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation of it.
DAN.2.8	The king answered and said, I know of certainty that you
DAN.2.9	But if you
DAN.2.10	The Kasdim 
DAN.2.11	And 
DAN.2.12	For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise 
DAN.2.13	And the decree went forth that the wise 
DAN.2.14	Then Dani’el 
DAN.2.15	He answered and said to Aryokh 
DAN.2.16	Then Dani’el 
DAN.2.17	Then Dani’el 
DAN.2.18	That they would desire mercies of the God-Elōhīm 
DAN.2.19	Then was the secret revealed unto Dani’el 
DAN.2.20	Dani’el 
DAN.2.21	And he changes the times and the seasons: he removes kings, and sets up kings: he gives wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:
DAN.2.22	He reveals the deep and secret things: he knows what 
DAN.2.23	I thank you
DAN.2.24	Therefore Dani’el 
DAN.2.25	Then Aryokh 
DAN.2.26	The king answered and said to Dani’el 
DAN.2.27	Dani’el 
DAN.2.28	But there is a God-Elōhīm 
DAN.2.29	As for you
DAN.2.30	But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for 
DAN.2.31	you
DAN.2.32	This image’s head 
DAN.2.33	His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.
DAN.2.34	you
DAN.2.35	Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that struck the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.
DAN.2.36	This 
DAN.2.37	you
DAN.2.38	And wherever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven has he given into you
DAN.2.39	And after you
DAN.2.40	And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaks in pieces and subdues all 
DAN.2.41	And whereas you
DAN.2.42	And 
DAN.2.43	And whereas you
DAN.2.44	And in the days of these kings shall the God-Elōhīm 
DAN.2.45	Forasmuch as you
DAN.2.46	Then the king N’vukhadnetzar 
DAN.2.47	The king answered unto Dani’el 
DAN.2.48	Then the king made Dani’el 
DAN.2.49	Then Dani’el 
DAN.3.1	N’vukhadnetzar 
DAN.3.2	Then N’vukhadnetzar 
DAN.3.3	Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that N’vukhadnetzar 
DAN.3.4	Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,
DAN.3.6	And whoso falls not down and worships shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
DAN.3.7	Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet 
DAN.3.8	For what reason at that time certain Kasdim 
DAN.3.9	They spoke and said to the king N’vukhadnetzar 
DAN.3.10	you
DAN.3.11	And whoso falls not down and worships, 
DAN.3.12	There are certain Y’hudim 
DAN.3.13	Then N’vukhadnetzar 
DAN.3.14	N’vukhadnetzar 
DAN.3.15	Now if you
DAN.3.16	Shadrakh 
DAN.3.17	If it be 
DAN.3.18	But if not, be it known unto you
DAN.3.19	Then was N’vukhadnetzar 
DAN.3.20	And he commanded the most mighty men that 
DAN.3.21	Then these men were bound in their coats, their trousers, and their hats, and their 
DAN.3.22	Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire killed those men that took up Shadrakh 
DAN.3.23	And these three men, Shadrakh 
DAN.3.24	Then N’vukhadnetzar 
DAN.3.25	He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God-Elōhīm 
DAN.3.26	Then N’vukhadnetzar 
DAN.3.27	And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s counselors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.
DAN.3.29	Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak anything amiss 
DAN.3.30	Then the king promoted Shadrakh 
DAN.4.1	N’vukhadnetzar 
DAN.4.2	I thought it good to show the signs and wonders that the high God-Elōhīm 
DAN.4.3	How great 
DAN.4.4	I N’vukhadnetzar 
DAN.4.5	I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.
DAN.4.6	Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise 
DAN.4.7	Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Kasdim 
DAN.4.8	But at the last Dani’el 
DAN.4.9	O Belt-shatzar 
DAN.4.10	Thus 
DAN.4.11	The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:
DAN.4.12	The leaves thereof 
DAN.4.13	I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;
DAN.4.14	He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:
DAN.4.15	Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and 
DAN.4.16	Let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.
DAN.4.17	This matter 
DAN.4.18	This dream I king N’vukhadnetzar 
DAN.4.19	Then Dani’el 
DAN.4.20	The tree that you
DAN.4.21	Whose leaves 
DAN.4.22	It 
DAN.4.23	And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and 
DAN.4.24	This 
DAN.4.25	That they shall drive you
DAN.4.26	And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; you
DAN.4.27	For what reason, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto you
DAN.4.28	All this came upon the king N’vukhadnetzar 
DAN.4.29	At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Bavel 
DAN.4.30	The king spoke, and said, Is not this great Bavel 
DAN.4.31	While the word 
DAN.4.32	And they shall drive you
DAN.4.33	The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon N’vukhadnetzar 
DAN.4.34	And at the end of the days I N’vukhadnetzar 
DAN.4.35	And all the inhabitants of the earth 
DAN.4.36	At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counselors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.
DAN.4.37	Now I N’vukhadnetzar 
DAN.5.1	Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.
DAN.5.2	Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father N’vukhadnetzar 
DAN.5.3	Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God-Elōhīm 
DAN.5.4	They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.
DAN.5.5	In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.
DAN.5.6	Then the king’s Countenance 
DAN.5.7	The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Kasdim 
DAN.5.8	Then came in all the king’s wise 
DAN.5.9	Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his Countenance 
DAN.5.11	There is a man in you
DAN.5.12	Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Dani’el 
DAN.5.13	Then was Dani’el 
DAN.5.14	I have even heard of you
DAN.5.15	And now the wise 
DAN.5.16	And I have heard of you
DAN.5.17	Then Dani’el 
DAN.5.18	O you
DAN.5.19	And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he killed; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.
DAN.5.20	But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:
DAN.5.21	And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling 
DAN.5.22	And you
DAN.5.23	But have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before you
DAN.5.24	Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.
DAN.5.25	And this 
DAN.5.26	This 
DAN.5.27	TEKEL; you
DAN.5.28	PERES; You
DAN.5.29	Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Dani’el 
DAN.5.30	In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Kasdim 
DAN.5.31	And Daryavesh 
DAN.6.1	It pleased Daryavesh 
DAN.6.2	And over these three presidents; of whom Dani’el 
DAN.6.3	Then this Dani’el 
DAN.6.4	Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Dani’el 
DAN.6.5	Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Dani’el 
DAN.6.6	Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Daryavesh 
DAN.6.7	All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counselors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God-Elōhīm 
DAN.6.8	Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes 
DAN.6.9	For what reason king Daryavesh 
DAN.6.10	Now when Dani’el 
DAN.6.11	Then these men assembled, and found Dani’el 
DAN.6.12	Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king’s decree; Have you
DAN.6.13	Then answered they and said before the king, That Dani’el 
DAN.6.14	Then the king, when he heard 
DAN.6.15	Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes 
DAN.6.16	Then the king commanded, and they brought Dani’el 
DAN.6.17	And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet 
DAN.6.18	Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep went from him.
DAN.6.19	Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.
DAN.6.20	And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Dani’el 
DAN.6.21	Then said Dani’el 
DAN.6.22	My God-Elōhīm 
DAN.6.23	Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Dani’el 
DAN.6.24	And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Dani’el 
DAN.6.25	Then king Daryavesh 
DAN.6.26	I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God-Elōhīm 
DAN.6.27	He delivers and rescues, and he works signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who has delivered Dani’el 
DAN.6.28	So this Dani’el 
DAN.7.1	In the first year of Belshazzar king of Bavel 
DAN.7.2	Dani’el 
DAN.7.3	And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.
DAN.7.4	The first 
DAN.7.5	And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and 
DAN.7.6	After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.
DAN.7.7	After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue 
DAN.7.8	I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn 
DAN.7.9	I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment 
DAN.7.10	A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.
DAN.7.11	I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke: I beheld 
DAN.7.12	As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.
DAN.7.13	I saw in the night visions, and, behold, 
DAN.7.14	And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion 
DAN.7.15	I Dani’el 
DAN.7.16	I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the tof all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.
DAN.7.17	These great beasts, which are four, 
DAN.7.18	But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.
DAN.7.19	Then I would know the tof the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth 
DAN.7.20	And of the ten horns that 
DAN.7.21	I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;
DAN.7.22	Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.
DAN.7.23	Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall trample it down, and break it in pieces.
DAN.7.24	And the ten horns out of this kingdom 
DAN.7.25	And he shall speak 
DAN.7.26	But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy 
DAN.7.27	And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom 
DAN.7.28	Till this point in time 
DAN.8.1	In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, 
DAN.8.2	And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I 
DAN.8.3	Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had 
DAN.8.4	I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither 
DAN.8.5	And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat 
DAN.8.6	And he came to the ram that had 
DAN.8.7	And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and struck the ram, and broke his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
DAN.8.8	Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.
DAN.8.9	And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant 
DAN.8.10	And it waxed great, 
DAN.8.11	Yes, he magnified 
DAN.8.12	And an host was given 
DAN.8.13	Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain 
DAN.8.14	And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred evening morning 
DAN.8.15	And it came to pass, when I, 
DAN.8.16	And I heard a man’s voice between 
DAN.8.17	So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O Son of man: for at the time of the end 
DAN.8.18	Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.
DAN.8.19	And he said, Behold, I will make you
DAN.8.20	The ram which you
DAN.8.21	And the rough goat 
DAN.8.22	Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.
DAN.8.23	And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce Countenance 
DAN.8.24	And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practice, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.
DAN.8.25	And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify 
DAN.8.26	And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told 
DAN.8.27	And I Dani’el 
DAN.9.1	In the first year of Daryavesh 
DAN.9.2	In the first year of his reign I Dani’el 
DAN.9.3	And I set my face unto the Lord-Adonai 
DAN.9.4	And I prayed unto the 
DAN.9.5	We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from you
DAN.9.6	Neither have we listened unto you
DAN.9.7	O Lord-Adonai 
DAN.9.8	O Lord, to us 
DAN.9.9	To the Lord our God-Elōhīm 
DAN.9.10	Neither have we obeyed the voice of the 
DAN.9.11	Yes, all Yisra’el 
DAN.9.12	And he has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven has not been done as has been done upon Yerushalayim 
DAN.9.13	As 
DAN.9.14	Therefore has the 
DAN.9.15	And now, O Lord-Adonai 
DAN.9.16	O Lord-Adonai 
DAN.9.17	Now therefore, O our God-Elōhīm 
DAN.9.18	O my God-Elōhīm 
DAN.9.19	O Lord-Adonai 
DAN.9.20	And whiles I 
DAN.9.21	Yes, whiles I 
DAN.9.22	And he informed 
DAN.9.23	At the beginning of you
DAN.9.24	Seventy weeks are determined upon you
DAN.9.25	Know therefore and understand, 
DAN.9.26	And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof 
DAN.9.27	And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make 
DAN.10.1	In the third year of Koresh 
DAN.10.2	In those days I Dani’el 
DAN.10.3	I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.
DAN.10.4	And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which 
DAN.10.5	Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose waist 
DAN.10.6	His body also 
DAN.10.7	And I Dani’el 
DAN.10.8	Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.
DAN.10.9	Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.
DAN.10.10	And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and 
DAN.10.11	And he said unto me, O Dani’el 
DAN.10.12	Then said he unto me, Fear not, Dani’el 
DAN.10.13	But the prince of the kingdom of Paras 
DAN.10.14	Now I am come to make you
DAN.10.15	And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.
DAN.10.16	And, behold, 
DAN.10.17	For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, immediately there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.
DAN.10.18	Then there came again and touched me 
DAN.10.19	And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace 
DAN.10.20	Then said he, Know you
DAN.10.21	But I will show you
DAN.11.1	Also I in the first year of Daryavesh 
DAN.11.2	And now will I show you
DAN.11.3	And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.
DAN.11.4	And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.
DAN.11.5	And the king of the south shall be strong, and 
DAN.11.6	And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king’s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat 
DAN.11.7	But out of a branch of her roots shall 
DAN.11.8	And shall also carry captives into Mitzrayim 
DAN.11.9	So the king of the south shall come into 
DAN.11.10	But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and 
DAN.11.11	And the king of the south shall be moved with anger, and shall come forth and fight with him, 
DAN.11.13	For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.
DAN.11.14	And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of you
DAN.11.15	So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither 
DAN.11.16	But he that comes against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.
DAN.11.17	He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand 
DAN.11.18	After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach 
DAN.11.19	Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.
DAN.11.20	Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes 
DAN.11.21	And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.
DAN.11.22	And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yes, also the prince of the covenant.
DAN.11.23	And after the league 
DAN.11.24	He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do 
DAN.11.25	And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.
DAN.11.26	Yes, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.
DAN.11.27	And both these kings’ hearts 
DAN.11.28	Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart 
DAN.11.29	At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.
DAN.11.30	For the ships of Kittim 
DAN.11.31	And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily 
DAN.11.32	And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God-Elōhīm 
DAN.11.33	And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil 
DAN.11.34	Now when they shall fall, they shall be helped with a little help: but many shall cleave 
DAN.11.35	And 
DAN.11.36	And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvelous things against the God-Elōhīm 
DAN.11.37	Neither shall he regard the God-Elōhīm 
DAN.11.38	But in his estate shall he honour the God-Elōhīm 
DAN.11.39	Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge 
DAN.11.40	And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.
DAN.11.41	He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many 
DAN.11.42	He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Mitzrayim 
DAN.11.43	But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Mitzrayim 
DAN.11.44	But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.
DAN.11.45	And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.
DAN.12.1	And at that time shall Mikha’el 
DAN.12.2	And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame 
DAN.12.3	And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the Firmament 
DAN.12.4	But you
DAN.12.5	Then I Dani’el 
DAN.12.6	And 
DAN.12.7	And I heard the man clothed in linen, which 
DAN.12.8	And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord-Adon 
DAN.12.9	And he said, Go you
DAN.12.10	Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.
DAN.12.11	And from the time 
DAN.12.12	Blessed 
DAN.12.13	But go you
EZR.1.1	Now in the first year of Koresh 
EZR.1.2	Thus says Koresh 
EZR.1.3	Who 
EZR.1.4	And whosoever remains in any place where he sojournes, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God-Elōhīm 
EZR.1.5	Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Y’hudah 
EZR.1.6	And all they that 
EZR.1.7	Also Koresh 
EZR.1.8	Even those did Koresh 
EZR.1.9	And this 
EZR.1.10	Thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second

EZR.2.61	And of the children of the priests: the children of Havayah 
EZR.2.62	These sought their register 
EZR.2.63	And the Tirshata

EZR.2.65	Beside their servants and their maids, of whom 
EZR.2.66	Their horses 
EZR.2.67	Their camels, four hundred thirty and five; 
EZR.2.68	And 
EZR.2.69	They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pound of silver, and one hundred priests’ garments.
EZR.2.70	So the priests, and the Levi’im 
EZR.3.1	And when the seventh month was come, and the people of Yisra’el 
EZR.3.2	Then stood up Yeshua 
EZR.3.3	And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear 
EZR.3.4	They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as 
EZR.3.5	And afterward 
EZR.3.6	From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the 
EZR.3.7	They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Tzidon 
EZR.3.8	Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God-Elōhīm 
EZR.3.9	Then stood Yeshua 
EZR.3.10	And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the 
EZR.3.11	And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the 
EZR.3.12	But many of the priests and Levi’im 
EZR.3.13	So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.
EZR.4.1	Now when the adversaries of Y’hudah 
EZR.4.2	Then they came to Z’rubavel 
EZR.4.3	But Z’rubavel 
EZR.4.4	Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Y’hudah 
EZR.4.5	And hired counselors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Koresh 
EZR.4.6	And in the reign of Achashverosh 
EZR.4.7	And in the days of Artach’shashta [I will make the spoiled to boil: I will stir myself 
EZR.4.8	Rechum 
EZR.4.9	Then 
EZR.4.10	And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnappar 
EZR.4.11	This 
EZR.4.12	Be it known unto the king, that the Y’hudim 
EZR.4.13	Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be built, and the walls set up 
EZR.4.14	Now because we have maintenance from 
EZR.4.15	That search may be made in the book of the records of you
EZR.4.16	We certify the king that, if this city be built 
EZR.4.18	The letter which you
EZR.4.19	And I commanded, and search has been made, and it is found that this city of old time has made insurrection against kings, and 
EZR.4.20	There have been mighty kings also over Yerushalayim 
EZR.4.21	Give you
EZR.4.22	Take heed now that you
EZR.4.23	Now when the copy of king Artach’shashta 
EZR.4.24	Then ceased the work of the house of God-Elōhīm 
EZR.5.1	Then the prophets, Hagai 
EZR.5.2	Then rose up Z’rubavel 
EZR.5.3	At the same time came to them Tatnai 
EZR.5.4	Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building?
EZR.5.5	But the eye of their God-Elōhīm 
EZR.5.6	The copy of the letter that Tatnai 
EZR.5.7	They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Daryavesh 
EZR.5.8	Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God-Elōhīm 
EZR.5.9	Then asked we those elders, 
EZR.5.10	We asked their names also, to certify you
EZR.5.11	And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God-Elōhīm 
EZR.5.12	But after that our fathers had provoked the God-Elōhīm 
EZR.5.13	But in the first year of Koresh 
EZR.5.14	And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God-Elōhīm 
EZR.5.15	And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that 
EZR.5.16	Then came the same Sheshbatzar 
EZR.5.17	Now therefore, if 
EZR.6.1	Then Daryavesh 
EZR.6.2	And there was found at Achm’ta 
EZR.6.3	In the first year of Koresh 
EZR.6.5	And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God-Elōhīm 
EZR.6.6	Now 
EZR.6.7	Let the work of this house of God-Elōhīm 
EZR.6.8	Moreover I make a decree what you
EZR.6.9	And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God-Elōhīm 
EZR.6.10	That they may offer sacrifices of soothing aromas unto the God-Elōhīm 
EZR.6.11	Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this.
EZR.6.12	And the God-Elōhīm 
EZR.6.13	Then Tatnai 
EZR.6.14	And the elders of the Y’hudim 
EZR.6.15	And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Daryavesh 
EZR.6.16	And the people of Yisra’el 
EZR.6.17	And offered at the dedication of this house of God-Elōhīm 
EZR.6.18	And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levi’im 
EZR.6.19	And the children of the captivity kept the Passover upon the fourteenth 
EZR.6.20	For the priests and the Levi’im 
EZR.6.21	And the people of Yisra’el 
EZR.6.22	And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the 
EZR.7.1	Now after these things, in the reign of Artach’shashta 
EZR.7.2	The son of Shalum 
EZR.7.3	The son of Amaryah 
EZR.7.4	The son of Z’rachyah 
EZR.7.5	The son of Avishua 
EZR.7.6	This ‘went up from Bavel 
EZR.7.7	And there went up 
EZR.7.8	And he came to Yerushalayim 
EZR.7.9	For upon the first 
EZR.7.10	For ‘had prepared his heart to seek the law of the 
EZR.7.11	Now this 
EZR.7.12	Artach’shashta 
EZR.7.13	I make a decree, that all they of the people of Yisra’el 
EZR.7.14	Forasmuch as you
EZR.7.15	And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have freely offered unto the God-Elōhīm 
EZR.7.16	And all the silver and gold that you
EZR.7.17	That you
EZR.7.18	And whatsoever shall seem good to you
EZR.7.19	The vessels also that are given you
EZR.7.20	And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of you
EZR.7.21	And I, 
EZR.7.22	Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing 
EZR.7.23	Whatsoever is commanded by the God-Elah 
EZR.7.24	Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levi’im 
EZR.7.25	And you
EZR.7.26	And whosoever will not do the law of you
EZR.7.27	Blessed 
EZR.7.28	And has extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counselors, and before all the king’s mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the 
EZR.8.1	These 
EZR.8.2	Of the sons of Pinchas 
EZR.8.3	Of the sons of Sh’khanyah 
EZR.8.4	Of the sons of Pachat-Mo’av 
EZR.8.5	Of the sons of Sh’khanyah 
EZR.8.6	Of the sons also of ‘Adin 
EZR.8.7	And of the sons of ‘Eilam 
EZR.8.8	And of the sons of Sh’fatyah 
EZR.8.9	Of the sons of Yo’av 
EZR.8.10	And of the sons of Shlomit 
EZR.8.11	And of the sons of Bevai 
EZR.8.12	And of the sons of ‘Azgad 
EZR.8.13	And of the last sons of Adonikam 
EZR.8.14	Of the sons also of Bigvai 
EZR.8.15	And I gathered them together to the river that runs to Ahava 
EZR.8.16	Then sent I for Eli’ezer 
EZR.8.17	And I sent them with commandment unto ‘Iddo 
EZR.8.18	And by the good hand of our God-Elōhīm 
EZR.8.19	And Hashavyah 
EZR.8.20	Also of the temple servants, whom David 
EZR.8.21	Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava 
EZR.8.22	For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God-Elōhīm 
EZR.8.23	So we fasted and besought our God-Elōhīm 
EZR.8.24	Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherevyah 
EZR.8.25	And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, 
EZR.8.26	I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, 
EZR.8.27	Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.
EZR.8.28	And I said unto them, You
EZR.8.29	Watch you
EZR.8.30	So took the priests and the Levi’im 
EZR.8.31	Then we departed from the river of Ahava 
EZR.8.32	And we came to Yerushalayim 
EZR.8.33	Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God-Elōhīm 
EZR.8.34	By number 
EZR.8.36	And they delivered the king’s commissions unto the king’s lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God-Elōhīm 
EZR.9.1	Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Yisra’el 
EZR.9.2	For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of 
EZR.9.3	And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my Mantle 
EZR.9.4	Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God-Elōhīm 
EZR.9.5	And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my Mantle 
EZR.9.6	And said, O my God-Elōhīm 
EZR.9.7	Since the days of our fathers 
EZR.9.8	And now for a little space grace has been 
EZR.9.9	For we 
EZR.9.10	And now, O our God-Elōhīm 
EZR.9.11	Which you
EZR.9.12	Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth forever: that you
EZR.9.13	And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that you
EZR.9.14	Should we again break you
EZR.9.15	O 
EZR.10.1	Now when ‘had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God-Elōhīm 
EZR.10.2	And Sh’khanyah 
EZR.10.3	Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God-Elōhīm 
EZR.10.4	Arise; for 
EZR.10.5	Then arose ‘Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levi’im 
EZR.10.6	Then ‘rose up from before the house of God-Elōhīm 
EZR.10.7	And they made proclamation throughout Y’hudah 
EZR.10.8	And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.
EZR.10.9	Then all the men of Y’hudah 
EZR.10.10	And ‘the priest stood up, and said unto them, You
EZR.10.11	Now therefore make confession unto the 
EZR.10.12	Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As you
EZR.10.13	But the people

NEH.1.1	The words of Nechemyah 
NEH.1.2	That Hanani 
NEH.1.3	And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province 
NEH.1.4	And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned 
NEH.1.5	And said, I beseech 
NEH.1.6	Let you
NEH.1.7	We have dealt very corruptly against you
NEH.1.8	Remember, I beseech 
NEH.1.9	But 
NEH.1.10	Now these 
NEH.1.11	O Lord-Adonai 
NEH.2.1	And it came to pass in the month Nisan 
NEH.2.2	For what reason the king said unto me, Why 
NEH.2.3	And said unto the king, Let the king live forever: why should not my Countenance 
NEH.2.4	Then the king said unto me, For what do you
NEH.2.5	And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if you
NEH.2.6	And the king said unto me, 
NEH.2.7	Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Y’hudah 
NEH.2.8	And a letter unto Asaf 
NEH.2.9	Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.
NEH.2.10	When Sanvalat 
NEH.2.11	So I came to Yerushalayim 
NEH.2.12	And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I 
NEH.2.13	And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Yerushalayim 
NEH.2.14	Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king’s pool: but 
NEH.2.15	Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and 
NEH.2.16	And the rulers knew not to which I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told 
NEH.2.17	Then said I unto them, You
NEH.2.18	Then I told them of the hand of my God-Elōhīm 
NEH.2.19	But when Sanvalat 
NEH.2.20	Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God-Elōhīm 
NEH.3.1	Then Elyashiv 
NEH.3.2	And next unto him built the men of Yericho 
NEH.3.3	But the fish gate did the sons of Hasna’ah 
NEH.3.4	And next unto them repaired M’remot 
NEH.3.5	And next unto them the T’koi 
NEH.3.6	Moreover the old gate repaired Y’hoyada 
NEH.3.7	And next unto them repaired M’latyah 
NEH.3.8	Next unto him repaired Uzziel 
NEH.3.9	And next unto them repaired Refayah 
NEH.3.10	And next unto them repaired Y’da’yah 
NEH.3.11	Malkiyah 
NEH.3.12	And next unto him repaired Shalum 
NEH.3.13	The valley gate repaired Hanun 
NEH.3.14	But the dung gate repaired Malkiyah 
NEH.3.15	But the gate of the fountain repaired Shalun 
NEH.3.16	After him repaired Nechemyah 
NEH.3.17	After him repaired the Levi’im 
NEH.3.18	After him repaired their brethren, Bavai 
NEH.3.19	And next to him repaired ‘Ezer 
NEH.3.20	After him Barukh 
NEH.3.21	After him repaired M’remot 
NEH.3.22	And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain.
NEH.3.23	After him repaired Binyamin 
NEH.3.24	After him repaired Binui 
NEH.3.25	Palal 
NEH.3.26	Moreover the temple servants dwelt in ‘Ofel 
NEH.3.27	After them the T’koi 
NEH.3.28	From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over against his house.
NEH.3.29	After them repaired Tzadok 
NEH.3.30	After him repaired Hananyah 
NEH.3.31	After him repaired Malkiyah 
NEH.3.32	And between the going up of the corner unto the Sheep Gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.
NEH.4.1	But it came to pass, that when Sanvalat 
NEH.4.2	And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Shomron 
NEH.4.3	Now Toviyah 
NEH.4.4	Hear, O our God-Elōhīm 
NEH.4.5	And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before you
NEH.4.6	So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.
NEH.4.7	But it came to pass, 
NEH.4.8	And conspired all of them together to come 
NEH.4.9	Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God-Elōhīm 
NEH.4.10	And Y’hudah 
NEH.4.11	And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.
NEH.4.12	And it came to pass, that when the Y’hudim 
NEH.4.13	Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, 
NEH.4.14	And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not you
NEH.4.15	And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God-Elōhīm 
NEH.4.16	And it came to pass from that time forth, 
NEH.4.17	They which built on the wall, and they that bore burdens, with those that laded, 
NEH.4.18	For the builders, everyone had his sword girded by his side, and 
NEH.4.19	And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work 
NEH.4.20	In what place 
NEH.4.21	So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.
NEH.4.22	Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let everyone with his servant lodge within Yerushalayim 
NEH.4.23	So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, 
NEH.5.1	And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Y’hudim 
NEH.5.2	For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, 
NEH.5.4	There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king’s tribute, 
NEH.5.5	Yet now our flesh 
NEH.5.6	And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
NEH.5.7	Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, You
NEH.5.8	And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Y’hudim 
NEH.5.9	Also I said, It 
NEH.5.10	I likewise, 
NEH.5.11	Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth 
NEH.5.12	Then said they, We will restore 
NEH.5.13	Also I shook my lap, and said, So God-Elōhīm 
NEH.5.14	Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Y’hudah 
NEH.5.15	But the former governors that 
NEH.5.16	Yes, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants 
NEH.5.17	Moreover 
NEH.5.18	Now 
NEH.5.19	Think upon me, my God-Elōhīm 
NEH.6.1	Now it came to pass, when Sanvalat 
NEH.6.2	That Sanvalat 
NEH.6.3	And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I 
NEH.6.4	Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.
NEH.6.5	Then sent Sanvalat 
NEH.6.6	Wherein 
NEH.6.7	And you
NEH.6.8	Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as you
NEH.6.9	For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, 
NEH.6.10	Afterward I came unto the house of Sh’may’yah 
NEH.6.11	And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who 
NEH.6.12	And, lo, I perceived that God-Elōhīm 
NEH.6.13	Therefore 
NEH.6.14	My God-Elōhīm 
NEH.6.15	So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth 
NEH.6.16	And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard 
NEH.6.17	Moreover in those days the nobles of Y’hudah 
NEH.6.18	For 
NEH.6.19	Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. 
NEH.7.1	Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levi’im 
NEH.7.2	That I gave my brother Hanani 
NEH.7.3	And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Yerushalayim 
NEH.7.4	Now the city 
NEH.7.5	And my God-Elōhīm 
NEH.7.6	These 
NEH.7.7	Who came with Z’rubavel

NEH.8.1	And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that 
NEH.8.2	And ‘the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.

NEH.8.6	And ‘Blessed 
NEH.8.7	Also Yeshua 
NEH.8.8	So they read in the book in the law of God-Elōhīm 
NEH.8.9	And Nechemyah 
NEH.8.10	Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for 
NEH.8.11	So the Levi’im 
NEH.8.12	And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great gladness, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them.
NEH.8.13	And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levi’im 
NEH.8.14	And they found written in the law which the 
NEH.8.15	And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Yerushalayim 
NEH.8.16	So the people went forth, and brought 
NEH.8.17	And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Yeshua

NEH.9.11	And you
NEH.9.12	Moreover you
NEH.9.13	you
NEH.9.14	And made known unto them you
NEH.9.15	And gave them bread from heaven for their hunger, and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promised them that they should go in to possess the land which you
NEH.9.16	But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and listened not to you
NEH.9.17	And refused to obey, neither were mindful of you
NEH.9.18	Yes, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This 
NEH.9.19	Yet you
NEH.9.20	you
NEH.9.21	Yes, forty years did you

NEH.9.25	And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells excavated, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in you
NEH.9.26	Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against you

NEH.12.45	And both the singers and the porters kept the ward 
NEH.12.46	For in the days of David 
NEH.12.47	And all Yisra’el 
NEH.13.1	On that day they read in the book of Moshe 
NEH.13.2	Because they met not the people of Yisra’el 
NEH.13.3	Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Yisra’el 
NEH.13.4	And before this, Elyashiv 
NEH.13.5	And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the New Wine, and the oil, which was commanded 
NEH.13.6	But in all this 
NEH.13.7	And I came to Yerushalayim 
NEH.13.8	And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Toviyah 
NEH.13.9	Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and there brought I again the vessels of the house of God-Elōhīm 
NEH.13.10	And I perceived that the portions of the Levi’im 
NEH.13.11	Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God-Elōhīm 
NEH.13.12	Then brought all Y’hudah 
NEH.13.13	And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemyah 
NEH.13.14	Remember me, O my God-Elōhīm 
NEH.13.15	In those days saw I in Y’hudah 
NEH.13.16	There dwelt men of Tzor 
NEH.13.17	Then I contended with the nobles of Y’hudah 
NEH.13.18	Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God-Elōhīm 
NEH.13.19	And it came to pass, that when the gates of Yerushalayim 
NEH.13.20	So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Yerushalayim 
NEH.13.21	Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge you
NEH.13.22	And I commanded the Levi’im 
NEH.13.23	In those days also saw I Y’hudim 
NEH.13.24	And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod 
NEH.13.25	And I contended with them, and cursed them, and struck certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God-Elōhīm 
NEH.13.26	Did not Shlomo 
NEH.13.27	Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God-Elōhīm 
NEH.13.28	And 
NEH.13.29	Remember them, O my God-Elōhīm 
NEH.13.30	Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levi’im 
NEH.13.31	And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God-Elōhīm

2CH.3.17	And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Yakhin 
2CH.4.1	Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.
2CH.4.2	Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass (go around, encircle; encompass), and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass

2CH.5.3	For what reason all the men of Yisra’el 
2CH.5.4	And all the elders of Yisra’el 
2CH.5.5	And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that 
2CH.5.6	Also king Shlomo 
2CH.5.7	And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the 
2CH.5.8	For the k’vurim 
2CH.5.9	And they drew out the rods 
2CH.5.11	And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy 
2CH.5.12	Also the Levi’im 
2CH.5.13	It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers 
2CH.5.14	So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the 
2CH.6.1	Then said Shlomo 
2CH.6.2	But I have built an house of habitation for you
2CH.6.3	And the king turned his face, and Blessed 
2CH.6.4	And he said, Blessed 
2CH.6.5	Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Mitzrayim 
2CH.6.6	But I have chosen Yerushalayim 
2CH.6.7	Now it was in the heart of David 
2CH.6.8	But the 
2CH.6.9	Yet you
2CH.6.10	The 
2CH.6.11	And in it have I put the ark, wherein 
2CH.6.12	And he stood before the altar of the 
2CH.6.13	For Shlomo 
2CH.6.14	And said, O 
2CH.6.15	you
2CH.6.16	Now therefore, O 
2CH.6.17	Now then, O 
2CH.6.18	But will God-Elōhīm 
2CH.6.19	Have respect therefore to the prayer of your
2CH.6.20	That your
2CH.6.21	Listen therefore unto the supplications of your
2CH.6.22	If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath come before your
2CH.6.23	Then hear you
2CH.6.24	And if your
2CH.6.25	Then hear you
2CH.6.26	When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you
2CH.6.27	Then hear you
2CH.6.28	If there be famine in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness 
2CH.6.30	Then hear you
2CH.6.31	That they may fear you
2CH.6.32	Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of your
2CH.6.33	Then hear you
2CH.6.34	If you
2CH.6.35	Then hear you
2CH.6.36	If they sin against you
2CH.6.37	Yet 
2CH.6.38	If they return to you
2CH.6.39	Then hear you
2CH.6.40	Now, my God-Elōhīm 
2CH.6.41	Now therefore arise, O 
2CH.6.42	O 
2CH.7.1	Now when Shlomo 
2CH.7.2	And the priests could not enter into the house of the 
2CH.7.3	And when all the people of Yisra’el 
2CH.7.4	Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the 
2CH.7.5	And king Shlomo 
2CH.7.6	And the priests waited on their offices: the Levi’im 
2CH.7.7	Moreover Shlomo 
2CH.7.8	Also at the same time Shlomo 
2CH.7.9	And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.
2CH.7.10	And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the 
2CH.7.11	Thus Shlomo 
2CH.7.12	And the 
2CH.7.13	If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;
2CH.7.14	If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
2CH.7.15	Now my eyes shall be open, and my ears attentive unto the prayer 
2CH.7.16	For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there forever: and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.
2CH.7.17	And as for you
2CH.7.18	Then will I establish the throne of your
2CH.7.19	But if you
2CH.7.20	Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it 
2CH.7.21	And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passes by it; so that he shall say, Why has the 
2CH.7.22	And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the 
2CH.8.1	And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Shlomo 
2CH.8.2	That the cities which Huram 
2CH.8.3	And Shlomo 
2CH.8.4	And he built Tadmor 
2CH.8.5	Also he built Beit-Horon 
2CH.8.6	And Ba’alat 
2CH.8.9	But of the people of Yisra’el 
2CH.8.10	And these 
2CH.8.11	And Shlomo 
2CH.8.12	Then Shlomo 
2CH.8.13	Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of Moshe 
2CH.8.14	And he appointed, according to the order of David 
2CH.8.15	And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levi’im 
2CH.8.16	Now all the work of Shlomo 
2CH.8.17	Then went Shlomo 
2CH.8.18	And Huram 
2CH.9.1	And when the Queen of Sh’va 
2CH.9.2	And Shlomo 
2CH.9.3	And when the Queen of Sh’va 
2CH.9.4	And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the 
2CH.9.5	And she said to the king, 
2CH.9.6	However I believed not their words, until I came, and my eyes had seen 
2CH.9.7	Happy 
2CH.9.8	Blessed 
2CH.9.9	And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the Queen of Sh’va 
2CH.9.10	And the servants also of Huram 
2CH.9.11	And the king made 
2CH.9.12	And king Shlomo 
2CH.9.13	Now the weight of gold that came to Shlomo 
2CH.9.14	Beside 
2CH.9.15	And king Shlomo 
2CH.9.16	And three hundred shields 
2CH.9.17	Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.
2CH.9.18	And 
2CH.9.19	And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.
2CH.9.20	And all the drinking vessels of king Shlomo 
2CH.9.21	For the king’s ships went to Tarshish 
2CH.9.22	And king Shlomo 
2CH.9.23	And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Shlomo 
2CH.9.24	And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and clothing, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
2CH.9.25	And Shlomo 
2CH.9.26	And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the P’lishtim 
2CH.9.27	And the king made silver in Yerushalayim 
2CH.9.28	And they brought unto Shlomo 
2CH.9.29	Now the rest of the acts of Shlomo 
2CH.9.30	And Shlomo 
2CH.9.31	And Shlomo 
2CH.10.1	And Rechav’am 
2CH.10.2	And it came to pass, when Yarov’am 
2CH.10.3	And they sent and called him. So Yarov’am 
2CH.10.4	You
2CH.10.5	And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.
2CH.10.6	And king Rechav’am 
2CH.10.7	And they spoke unto him, saying, If you
2CH.10.8	But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.
2CH.10.9	And he said unto them, What advice give you
2CH.10.10	And the young men that were brought up with him spoke unto him, saying, Thus shall you
2CH.10.11	For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I 
2CH.10.12	So Yarov’am 
2CH.10.13	And the king answered them roughly; and king Rechav’am 
2CH.10.14	And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I 
2CH.10.15	So the king listened not unto the people: for the cause was of God-Elōhīm 
2CH.10.16	And when all Yisra’el 
2CH.10.17	But 
2CH.10.18	Then king Rechav’am 
2CH.10.19	And Yisra’el 
2CH.11.1	And when Rechav’am 
2CH.11.2	But the word of the 
2CH.11.3	Speak unto Rechav’am 
2CH.11.4	Thus says the 
2CH.11.5	And Rechav’am 
2CH.11.6	He built even Beit-Lechem 
2CH.11.7	And Beit’Tzur 
2CH.11.8	And Gat 
2CH.11.9	And Adorayim 
2CH.11.10	And Tzor’ah 
2CH.11.11	And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine.
2CH.11.12	And in every single 
2CH.11.13	And the priests and the Levi’im 
2CH.11.14	For the Levi’im 
2CH.11.15	And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.
2CH.11.16	And after them out of all the tribes of Yisra’el 
2CH.11.17	So they strengthened the kingdom of Y’hudah 
2CH.11.18	And Rechav’am 
2CH.11.19	Which bore him children; Ye’ush 
2CH.11.20	And after her he took Ma’akhah 
2CH.11.21	And Rechav’am 
2CH.11.22	And Rechav’am 
2CH.11.23	And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Y’hudah 
2CH.12.1	And it came to pass, when Rechav’am 
2CH.12.2	And it came to pass, 
2CH.12.3	With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people 
2CH.12.4	And he took the fenced cities which 
2CH.12.5	Then came Sh’may’yah 
2CH.12.6	Whereupon the princes of Yisra’el 
2CH.12.7	And when the 
2CH.12.8	Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
2CH.12.9	So Shishak 
2CH.12.10	Instead of which king Rechav’am 
2CH.12.11	And when the king entered into the house of the 
2CH.12.12	And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the 
2CH.12.13	So king Rechav’am 
2CH.12.14	And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the 
2CH.12.15	Now the acts of Rechav’am 
2CH.12.16	And Rechav’am 
2CH.13.1	Now in the eighteenth year of king Yarov’am 
2CH.13.2	He reigned three years in Yerushalayim 
2CH.13.3	And Aviyah 
2CH.13.4	And Aviyah 
2CH.13.5	Ought you
2CH.13.6	Yet Yarov’am 
2CH.13.7	And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial 
2CH.13.8	And now you
2CH.13.9	Have you
2CH.13.10	But as for us, the 
2CH.13.11	And they burn unto the 
2CH.13.12	And, behold, God-Elōhīm 
2CH.13.13	But Yarov’am 
2CH.13.14	And when Y’hudah 
2CH.13.15	Then the men of Y’hudah 
2CH.13.16	And the people of Yisra’el 
2CH.13.17	And Aviyah 
2CH.13.18	Thus the people of Yisra’el 
2CH.13.19	And Aviyah 
2CH.13.20	Neither did Yarov’am 
2CH.13.21	But Aviyah 
2CH.13.22	And the rest of the acts of Aviyah 
2CH.14.1	So Aviyah 
2CH.14.2	And Asa 
2CH.14.3	For he took away the altars of the strange 
2CH.14.4	And commanded Y’hudah 
2CH.14.5	Also he took away out of all the cities of Y’hudah 
2CH.14.6	And he built fenced cities in Y’hudah 
2CH.14.7	Therefore he said unto Y’hudah 
2CH.14.8	And Asa

2CH.20.31	And Y’hoshafat 
2CH.20.32	And he walked in the way of Asa 
2CH.20.33	However the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God-Elōhīm 
2CH.20.34	Now the rest of the acts of Y’hoshafat 
2CH.20.35	And after this did Y’hoshafat 
2CH.20.36	And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish 
2CH.20.37	Then Eli’ezer 
2CH.21.1	Now Y’hoshafat 
2CH.21.2	And he had brethren the sons of Y’hoshafat 
2CH.21.3	And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Y’hudah 
2CH.21.4	Now when Y’horam 
2CH.21.5	Y’horam 
2CH.21.6	And he walked in the way of the kings of Yisra’el 
2CH.21.7	However the 
2CH.21.8	In his days the Edomi 
2CH.21.9	Then Y’horam 
2CH.21.10	So the Edomi 
2CH.21.11	Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Y’hudah 
2CH.21.12	And there came a writing to him from Eliyahu 
2CH.21.13	But have walked in the way of the kings of Yisra’el 
2CH.21.14	Behold, with a great plague will the 
2CH.21.15	And you
2CH.21.16	Moreover the 
2CH.21.17	And they came up into Y’hudah 
2CH.21.18	And after all this the 
2CH.21.19	And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels 
2CH.21.20	Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Yerushalayim 
2CH.22.1	And the inhabitants of Yerushalayim 
2CH.22.2	Forty and two years old 
2CH.22.3	He also walked in the ways of the house of Ach’av 
2CH.22.4	For what reason he did evil in the sight of the 
2CH.22.5	He walked also after their counsel, and went with Y’horam 
2CH.22.6	And he returned to be healed in Yizre’el 
2CH.22.7	And the destruction of Achazyah 
2CH.22.8	And it came to pass, that, when Yehu 
2CH.22.9	And he sought Achazyah 
2CH.22.10	But when ‘Atalyahu 
2CH.22.11	But Y’hoshav’at 
2CH.22.12	And he was with them hid in the house of God-Elōhīm 
2CH.23.1	And in the seventh year Y’hoyada 
2CH.23.2	And they went about in Y’hudah 
2CH.23.3	And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God-Elōhīm 
2CH.23.4	This 
2CH.23.5	And a third part 
2CH.23.6	But let none come into the house of the 
2CH.23.7	And the Levi’im 
2CH.23.8	So the Levi’im 
2CH.23.9	Moreover Y’hoyada 
2CH.23.10	And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about.
2CH.23.11	Then they brought out the king’s son, and put upon him the crown, and

2CH.23.14	Then Y’hoyada 
2CH.23.15	So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king’s house, they killed her there.
2CH.23.16	And Y’hoyada 
2CH.23.17	Then all the people went to the house of Ba’al 
2CH.23.18	Also Y’hoyada 
2CH.23.19	And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the 
2CH.23.20	And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the 
2CH.23.21	And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain ‘Atalyahu 
2CH.24.1	Yo’ash 
2CH.24.2	And Yo’ash 
2CH.24.3	And Y’hoyada 
2CH.24.4	And it came to pass after this, 
2CH.24.5	And he gathered together the priests and the Levi’im 
2CH.24.6	And the king called for Y’hoyada 
2CH.24.7	For the sons of ‘Atalyahu 
2CH.24.8	And at the king’s commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the 
2CH.24.9	And they made a proclamation through Y’hudah 
2CH.24.10	And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.
2CH.24.11	Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king’s office by the hand of the Levi’im 
2CH.24.12	And the king and Y’hoyada 
2CH.24.13	So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God-Elōhīm 
2CH.24.14	And when they had finished 
2CH.24.15	But Y’hoyada 
2CH.24.16	And they buried him in the city of David 
2CH.24.17	Now after the death of Y’hoyada 
2CH.24.18	And they left the house of the 
2CH.24.19	Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the 
2CH.24.20	And the Spirit of God-Elōhīm 
2CH.24.21	And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the 
2CH.24.22	Thus Yo’ash 
2CH.24.23	And it came to pass at the end of the year, 
2CH.24.24	For the army of the Aram 
2CH.24.25	And when they were departed from him, 
2CH.24.26	And these are they that conspired against him; Zavad

2CH.25.4	But he killed not their children, but 
2CH.25.5	Moreover Amatzyah 
2CH.25.6	He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Yisra’el 
2CH.25.7	But there came a man of God-Elōhīm

2CH.26.6	And he went forth and warred against the P’lishtim 
2CH.26.7	And God-Elōhīm 
2CH.26.8	And the ‘Amon 
2CH.26.9	Moreover ‘Uziyah 
2CH.26.10	Also he built towers in the desert, and excavated many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen 
2CH.26.11	Moreover ‘Uziyah

2CH.28.2	For he walked in the ways of the kings of Yisra’el 
2CH.28.3	Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom 
2CH.28.4	He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
2CH.28.5	For what reason the 
2CH.28.6	For Pekach 
2CH.28.7	And Zikhri 
2CH.28.8	And the people of Yisra’el 
2CH.28.9	But a prophet of the 
2CH.28.10	And now you
2CH.28.11	Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which you
2CH.28.12	Then certain of the heads of the children of Efrayim 
2CH.28.13	And said unto them, You
2CH.28.14	So the armed men left the captives and the spoil 
2CH.28.15	And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil 
2CH.28.16	At that time did king Achaz

2CH.28.24	And Achaz 
2CH.28.25	And in every single 
2CH.28.26	Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they 
2CH.28.27	And Achaz 
2CH.29.1	Hizkiyahu 
2CH.29.2	And he did 
2CH.29.3	He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the 
2CH.29.4	And he brought in the priests and the Levi’im 
2CH.29.5	And said unto them, Hear me, you
2CH.29.6	For our fathers have trespassed, and done 
2CH.29.7	Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy 
2CH.29.8	For what reason the wrath of the 
2CH.29.9	For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives 
2CH.29.10	Now 
2CH.29.11	My sons, be not now negligent: for the 
2CH.29.12	Then the Levi’im 
2CH.29.13	And of the sons of Elitzafan 
2CH.29.14	And of the sons of Heiman 
2CH.29.15	And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the 
2CH.29.16	And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the 
2CH.29.17	Now they began on the first 
2CH.29.18	Then they went in to Hizkiyahu 
2CH.29.19	Moreover all the vessels, which king Achaz 
2CH.29.20	Then Hizkiyahu 
2CH.29.21	And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Y’hudah 
2CH.29.22	So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled 
2CH.29.23	And they brought forth the he goats 
2CH.29.24	And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Yisra’el 
2CH.29.25	And he set the Levi’im 
2CH.29.26	And the Levi’im 
2CH.29.27	And Hizkiyahu

2CH.29.29	And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.
2CH.29.30	Moreover Hizkiyahu 
2CH.29.31	Then Hizkiyahu 
2CH.29.32	And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, 
2CH.29.33	And the consecrated things 
2CH.29.34	But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay 
2CH.29.35	And also the burnt offerings 
2CH.29.36	And Hizkiyahu 
2CH.30.1	And Hizkiyahu 
2CH.30.2	For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Yerushalayim 
2CH.30.3	For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Yerushalayim 
2CH.30.4	And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.
2CH.30.5	So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Yisra’el 
2CH.30.6	So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Yisra’el 
2CH.30.7	And be not you
2CH.30.8	Now be you
2CH.30.9	For if you

2CH.30.11	Nevertheless diverse of Asher 
2CH.30.12	Also in Y’hudah 
2CH.30.13	And there assembled at Yerushalayim 
2CH.30.14	And they arose and took away the altars that 
2CH.30.15	Then they killed the Passover on the fourteenth 
2CH.30.16	And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moshe 
2CH.30.17	For 
2CH.30.18	For a multitude of the people, 
2CH.30.20	And the 
2CH.30.21	And the people of Yisra’el 
2CH.30.22	And Hizkiyahu 
2CH.30.23	And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept 
2CH.30.24	For Hizkiyahu 
2CH.30.25	And all the congregation of Y’hudah 
2CH.30.26	So there was great joy in Yerushalayim 
2CH.30.27	Then the priests the Levi’im 
2CH.31.1	Now when all this was finished, all Yisra’el 
2CH.31.2	And Hizkiyahu 
2CH.31.4	Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Yerushalayim 
2CH.31.5	And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the people of Yisra’el 
2CH.31.6	And 
2CH.31.7	In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished 
2CH.31.8	And when Hizkiyahu 
2CH.31.9	Then Hizkiyahu 
2CH.31.10	And ‘Azaryah 
2CH.31.11	Then Hizkiyahu 
2CH.31.12	And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated 
2CH.31.13	And Jehiel, and ‘Azazyahu 
2CH.31.14	And Kore 
2CH.31.15	And next him 
2CH.31.16	Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, 
2CH.31.17	Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levi’im 
2CH.31.18	And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness:
2CH.31.19	Also of the sons of Aharon 
2CH.31.20	And thus did Hizkiyahu 
2CH.31.21	And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God-Elōhīm 
2CH.32.1	After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sancheriv [Sin 
2CH.32.2	And when Hizkiyahu 
2CH.32.3	He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which 
2CH.32.4	So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Ashur 
2CH.32.5	Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised 
2CH.32.6	And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spoke comfortably to them, saying,
2CH.32.7	Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Ashur 
2CH.32.8	With him 
2CH.32.9	After this did Sancheriv 
2CH.32.10	Thus says Sancheriv [Sin 
2CH.32.11	Does not Hizkiyahu 
2CH.32.12	Has not the same Hizkiyahu 
2CH.32.13	Know you
2CH.32.14	Who 
2CH.32.15	Now therefore let not Hizkiyahu 
2CH.32.16	And his servants spoke yet 
2CH.32.17	He wrote also letters to rail on the 
2CH.32.18	Then they cried with a loud voice in the Y’hudit 
2CH.32.19	And they spoke against the God-Elōhīm 
2CH.32.20	And for this 
2CH.32.21	And the 
2CH.32.22	Thus the 
2CH.32.23	And many brought gifts unto the 
2CH.32.24	In those days Hizkiyahu 
2CH.32.25	But Hizkiyahu 
2CH.32.26	Yet Hizkiyahu 
2CH.32.27	And Hizkiyahu 
2CH.32.28	Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and stables for flocks.
2CH.32.29	Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God-Elōhīm 
2CH.32.30	This same Hizkiyahu 
2CH.32.31	However in 
2CH.32.32	Now the rest of the acts of Hizkiyahu 
2CH.32.33	And Hizkiyahu 
2CH.33.1	M’nasheh 
2CH.33.2	But did 
2CH.33.3	For he built again the high places which Hizkiyahu 
2CH.33.4	Also he built altars in the house of the 
2CH.33.5	And he built altars for all the army of heaven in the two courts of the house of the 
2CH.33.6	And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom 
2CH.33.7	And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God-Elōhīm 
2CH.33.8	Neither will I any more remove the foot of Yisra’el 
2CH.33.9	So M’nasheh 
2CH.33.10	And the 
2CH.33.11	For what reason the 
2CH.33.12	And when he was in affliction, he besought the 
2CH.33.13	And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Yerushalayim 
2CH.33.14	Now after this he built a wall without the city of David 
2CH.33.15	And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the 
2CH.33.16	And he repaired the altar of the 
2CH.33.17	Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, 
2CH.33.18	Now the rest of the acts of M’nasheh 
2CH.33.19	His prayer also, and 
2CH.33.20	So M’nasheh 
2CH.33.21	‘Amon 
2CH.33.22	But he did 
2CH.33.23	And humbled not himself before the 
2CH.33.24	And his servants conspired against him, and killed him in his own house.
2CH.33.25	But the people of the land killed all them that had conspired against king ‘Amon 
2CH.34.1	Yoshiyahu 
2CH.34.2	And he did 
2CH.34.3	For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God-Elōhīm 
2CH.34.4	And they broke down the altars of Ba’alim 
2CH.34.5	And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Y’hudah 
2CH.34.6	And 
2CH.34.7	And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Yisra’el 
2CH.34.8	Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shafan 
2CH.34.9	And when they came to Hilkiyahu 
2CH.34.10	And they put 
2CH.34.11	Even to the artificers and builders gave they 
2CH.34.12	And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them 
2CH.34.13	Also 
2CH.34.14	And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the 
2CH.34.15	And Hilkiyahu 
2CH.34.16	And Shafan 
2CH.34.17	And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the 
2CH.34.18	Then Shafan 
2CH.34.19	And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.
2CH.34.20	And the king commanded Hilkiyahu 
2CH.34.21	Go, enquire of the 
2CH.34.22	And Hilkiyahu 
2CH.34.23	And she answered them, Thus says the 
2CH.34.24	Thus says the 
2CH.34.25	Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.
2CH.34.26	And as for the king of Y’hudah 
2CH.34.27	Because your
2CH.34.28	Behold, I will gather you
2CH.34.29	Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Y’hudah 
2CH.34.30	And the king went up into the house of the 
2CH.34.31	And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the 
2CH.34.32	And he caused all that were present in Yerushalayim 
2CH.34.33	And Yoshiyahu 
2CH.35.1	Moreover Yoshiyahu 
2CH.35.2	And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the 
2CH.35.3	And said unto the Levi’im 
2CH.35.4	And prepare 
2CH.35.5	And stand in the holy 
2CH.35.6	So kill the Passover, and sanctify 
2CH.35.7	And Yoshiyahu 
2CH.35.8	And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levi’im 
2CH.35.9	Konanyah 
2CH.35.10	So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levi’im 
2CH.35.11	And they killed the Passover, and the priests sprinkled 
2CH.35.12	And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the 
2CH.35.13	And they roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the 
2CH.35.14	And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aharon 
2CH.35.15	And the singers the sons of Asaf 
2CH.35.16	So all the service of the 
2CH.35.17	And the people of Yisra’el 
2CH.35.18	And there was no Passover like to that kept in Yisra’el 
2CH.35.19	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Yoshiyahu 
2CH.35.20	After all this, when Yoshiyahu 
2CH.35.21	But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with you
2CH.35.22	Nevertheless Yoshiyahu 
2CH.35.23	And the archers shot at king Yoshiyahu 
2CH.35.24	His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Yerushalayim 
2CH.35.25	And Yirmeyahu 
2CH.35.26	Now the rest of the acts of Yoshiyahu 
2CH.35.27	And his deeds, first and last, behold, they 
2CH.36.1	Then the people of the land took Y’ho’achaz 
2CH.36.2	Y’ho’achaz 
2CH.36.3	And the king of Mitzrayim 
2CH.36.4	And the king of Mitzrayim 
2CH.36.5	Y’hoyakim 
2CH.36.6	Against him came up N’vukhadnetzar 
2CH.36.7	N’vukhadnetzar 
2CH.36.8	Now the rest of the acts of Y’hoyakim 
2CH.36.9	Y’hoyakhin 
2CH.36.10	And when the year was expired, king N’vukhadnetzar 
2CH.36.11	Tzidkiyah 
2CH.36.12	And he did 
2CH.36.13	And he also rebelled against king N’vukhadnetzar 
2CH.36.14	Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the 
2CH.36.15	And the 
2CH.36.16	But they mocked the messengers of God-Elōhīm 
2CH.36.17	Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Kasdim 
2CH.36.18	And all the vessels of the house of God-Elōhīm 
2CH.36.19	And they burnt the house of God-Elōhīm 
2CH.36.20	And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Bavel 
2CH.36.21	To fulfil the word of the 
2CH.36.22	Now in the first year of Koresh 
2CH.36.23	Thus says Koresh 
MAT.1.1	These are the generations of Yeshua 
MAT.1.2	Avraham 
MAT.1.3	Y’hudah 
MAT.1.4	Ram 
MAT.1.5	Salmon 
MAT.1.6	Yishai 
MAT.1.7	Shlomo 
MAT.1.8	Asa 
MAT.1.9	‘Uziyahu 
MAT.1.10	Hizkiyahu 
MAT.1.11	Yoshiyahu 
MAT.1.12	Y’khanyahu 
MAT.1.13	Z’rubavel 
MAT.1.14	‘Azor 
MAT.1.15	El’ichud 
MAT.1.16	Ya’akov 
MAT.1.17	So all the generations from Avraham 
MAT.1.18	The birth of Yeshua 
MAT.1.19	Yosef 
MAT.1.20	While he thought on this matter in his heart, behold an angel appeared to him in a dream and said: “Yosef 
MAT.1.21	“She will bear a son and you will call his name Yeshua 
MAT.1.22	Then Yosef 
MAT.1.23	But he did not have intercourse with her until she brought forth her firstborn Son and he called his name Yeshua 
MAT.2.1	It came to pass when Yeshua 
MAT.2.2	saying: ‘Where is the King of the Yehudim 
MAT.2.3	Herod 
MAT.2.4	So he gathered all the chief priests and Torah-teachers 
MAT.2.5	They answered him: ‘In Beit-Lechem 
MAT.2.6	“You Beit-Lechem 
MAT.2.7	Then King Herod 
MAT.2.8	He sent them to Beit-Lechem 
MAT.2.9	They listened unto the king and departed and behold the star which they saw in the East was going before them until they came to the place. When they entered Beit-Lechem 
MAT.2.10	When they saw the star they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
MAT.2.11	They came into the house, found the Boy and his mother Miryam 
MAT.2.12	Then they were commanded in a dream by the angel who spoke to them not to return to Herod 
MAT.2.13	As they were going, behold an angel of Yehovah 
MAT.2.14	So he took the Boy and his mother by night and departed for Mitzrayim 
MAT.2.15	and was there until Herod 
MAT.2.16	Then Herod 
MAT.2.17	Then was fulfilled that which Yirmeyahu 
MAT.2.18	“A voice is heard in Ramah 
MAT.2.19	It came to pass when King Herod 
MAT.2.20	saying: “Arise, take the Boy and his mother and go to the land of Y’sra’el 
MAT.2.21	So he arose, took the Boy and his mother, and they returned to the land of Y’sra’el 
MAT.2.22	Then he heard that Archelaus 
MAT.2.23	He came and dwelt in a city called Natzeret in order to fulfill what the prophets said: “He shall be called ‘despised’”.
MAT.3.1	In those days came Yochanan 
MAT.3.2	He said: “Turn in repentance, for the Kingdom of heaven is near”.
MAT.3.3	To fulfill what was written by Yesha’yahu 
MAT.3.4	Behold Yochanan 
MAT.3.5	Then they came out to him from Yerushalayim 
MAT.3.6	and at that time were confessing their sins and were baptized by Yochanan 
MAT.3.7	He saw that many of the P’rushim 
MAT.3.8	“Produce the fruit of perfect repentance”.
MAT.3.9	“Do not say in your heart: ‘Avraham 
MAT.3.10	“Already the axe has reached the root of the tree; the one which does not produce good fruit will be cut down and burned in the fire”. The crowds asked him: ‘If so what shall we do’? Yochanan 
MAT.3.11	Yochanan 
MAT.3.12	“His winnowing fork is in his hand to fan 
MAT.3.13	Then came Yeshua 
MAT.3.14	But Yochanan 
MAT.3.15	Yeshua 
MAT.3.16	Immediately when he came up from the water, the heavens were opened to him and he saw The Ruach 
MAT.3.17	Then behold a voice from heaven was saying: “This is My beloved Son, whom I love very very much and in whom I am very well pleased”.
MAT.4.1	Then Yeshua 
MAT.4.2	He fasted forty days and forty nights and afterwards was hungry.
MAT.4.3	The tempter drew near and said to him: ‘If you are the Son of Elohim 
MAT.4.4	Yeshua 
MAT.4.5	Then Satan 
MAT.4.6	and said to him: ‘If you are the Son of Elohim 
MAT.4.7	Yeshua 
MAT.4.8	So Satan 
MAT.4.9	and said to him: ‘All these things I will give you if you bare your head to me’.
MAT.4.10	Then Yeshua 
MAT.4.11	Then Satan 
MAT.4.12	It came to pass in those days Yeshua 
MAT.4.13	He passed by Natzeret 
MAT.4.14	in order to fulfill that which Yesha’yahu 
MAT.4.15	“Land of Z’vulun 
MAT.4.16	“The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light; they that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined”.
MAT.4.17	From then on Yeshua 
MAT.4.18	Yeshua 
MAT.4.19	He said to them: “Come, follow me and I will make you fish for men”.
MAT.4.20	So they left their nets in that hour and followed him.
MAT.4.21	He turned from there and saw two other brothers; Ya’akov 
MAT.4.22	They made haste and left their nets and their father and followed after him.
MAT.4.23	Then Yeshua 
MAT.4.24	So a report about him went into all the land Syria 
MAT.4.25	Many followed him from Decapolis 
MAT.5.1	It came to pass after this; when he saw the crowds; that he went up on the mountain and sat down. Then his disciples came to him
MAT.5.2	and he opened his mouth and spoke to them saying:
MAT.5.3	“Blessed 
MAT.5.4	“Blessed 
MAT.5.5	“Blessed 
MAT.5.6	“Blessed 
MAT.5.7	“Blessed 
MAT.5.8	“Blessed 
MAT.5.9	“Blessed 
MAT.5.10	“Blessed 
MAT.5.11	“Blessed 
MAT.5.12	“Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is very great in heaven; for thus they persecuted the prophets who were before you”.
MAT.5.13	At that time Yeshua 
MAT.5.14	“You are light in the world. A city built upon a hill cannot be hidden”.
MAT.5.15	“They do not light a lamp to place it in a hidden place where it cannot shine; but they place it upon a lamp-stand so that it might shine for all in the house”.
MAT.5.16	“Thus let your light shine before every man to show them your good deeds which give praise and glory to your Father Who is in heaven”.
MAT.5.17	At that time Yeshua 
MAT.5.18	“Truly I say to you that until heaven and earth depart, one letter or one nikkudot (which means: ‘vowel point’) shall not be abolished from the Torah or the Prophets, because all will be fulfilled”.
MAT.5.19	“He who shall transgress one word of these commandments and shall teach others shall be called ‘a vain person’, in the Kingdom of heaven; but whoever upholds and teaches them shall be called ‘great’, in the Kingdom of heaven”.
MAT.5.20	At that time Yeshua 
MAT.5.21	“Have you not heard what was said to those of old: ‘You shall not murder and whoever murders is guilty of a judgment of death’”?
MAT.5.22	“But I say to you, he who angers his companion is guilty of judgment; he who calls his brother inferior shall be guilty of judgment before the congregation; he who calls him a fool is guilty of the fire of Gei-Hinnom 
MAT.5.23	“If you should offer your gift at the altar and remember that you have a quarrel with your companion and he is complaining about you because of this matter”,
MAT.5.24	“leave your gift there before the altar and go to appease him first and afterwards offer your gift”.
MAT.5.25	Then Yeshua 
MAT.5.26	“Truly I say to you, you will not come out from there until the last piece of money is given”.
MAT.5.27	Again he said to them: “You have heard what was said to those of long ago: You shall not commit adultery”.
MAT.5.28	“But I say to you that everyone who sees a woman and covets her has already committed adultery with her in his heart”.
MAT.5.29	“If you right eye seduces you, pluck it out and cast it from you”.
MAT.5.30	“Also, if your hand seduces you, cut it off. It is better for you to suffer 
MAT.5.31	Again Yeshua 
MAT.5.32	“And I say to you that everyone who leaves his wife is to give her a bill of divorce. But concerning adultery. he is the one who commits adultery and he who takes her commits adultery”.
MAT.5.33	“Again you have heard what was said to those of long ago: You shall not swear by My Name falsely, but you shall return to Yehovah 
MAT.5.34	“But I say to you not to swear uselessly in any matter, neither by Heaven because it is the throne of The Mighty One”,
MAT.5.35	“nor by Earth because it is the footstool of His feet, nor by Yerushalayim 
MAT.5.36	“nor by your head for you are not able to make one hair white or black”.
MAT.5.37	“But let your words be ‘yes yes’ or ‘no no’. Everything in addition to this is evil”.
MAT.5.38	“Again you have heard what is said in the Torah: An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth”.
MAT.5.39	“But I say to you, do not repay evil for evil; but he who smites your right cheek provide for him the left”.
MAT.5.40	“He who wishes to oppose you in judgment and to rob your shirt, leave to him your garment”.
MAT.5.41	“He who asks you to go with him a thousand steps, go with him two thousand”.
MAT.5.42	“To him who asks from you give and from him who wishes to borrow from you do not hold back”.
MAT.5.43	Again Yeshua 
MAT.5.44	“But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to the one who hates you and vexes you and pray for those who persecute you and oppress you”,
MAT.5.45	“in order that you might be sons of your Father Who is in heaven Who causes His sun to shine on the good and evil and causes it to rain on the just and the unjust”.
MAT.5.46	“If you love those who love you what is your reward? Do not the Goyim 
MAT.5.47	“And if you greet your friends only, what do you do more than others? Do not the Goyim 
MAT.5.48	“Be you perfect as your Father Who is in heaven is perfect”.
MAT.6.1	“Beware lest you do your charitable deeds before men that they might praise you; if you do, you will have no reward from your Father Who is in heaven”.
MAT.6.2	Again Yeshua 
MAT.6.3	“But when you do charitable deeds, let not your left hand know what your right hand is doing”,
MAT.6.4	“in order that your gift might be in secret and your Father Who sees hidden things will reward you”.
MAT.6.5	At that time Yeshua 
MAT.6.6	“But when you pray, go to your bedroom, close your doors upon you, and pray to your Father in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you”.
MAT.6.7	“So when you pray, do not multiply words as the heretics who think that by their multitude of words they will make themselves heard”
MAT.6.8	“Do not be like them. Your Father Who is in heaven knows your words before you ask from Him?”
MAT.6.9	“But thus you shall pray: Our Father, Who art 
MAT.6.10	“may Your Kingdom be Blessed 
MAT.6.11	“Give us our bread continually”.
MAT.6.12	“Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us,
MAT.6.13	“and do not allow us into the power of temptation but keep us from all evil. Amen”.
MAT.6.14	“If you forgive men their sins your Father Who is in heaven will forgive your sins”
MAT.6.15	“But if you do not forgive them He will not forgive you your sins”
MAT.6.16	Again he said to them: “When you fast do not be as the sad hypocrites who make themselves appear sad and who change their faces, to show their fasting before men; truly I say to you, they have already received their reward”.
MAT.6.17	“But when you fast, wash your heads”.
MAT.6.18	“that you might not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father Who is in secret, and your Father Who is in secret will reward you”.
MAT.6.19	Again he said to them: “Do not keep on heaping up treasures on earth so that decay and grub devour it or thieves dig through and steal them”
MAT.6.20	“Make for yourselves treasures in heaven where the worm and the grub do not devour them and where thieves do not dig through and steal”.
MAT.6.21	“In the place where your treasure is there will be your heart”.
MAT.6.22	“The lamp of your body is your eyes. If your eyes look straight ahead your body shall not be dark”.
MAT.6.23	“If your eyes grow dim your whole body will become dark; and if the light which is in you becomes dark, all your ways will be dark”.
MAT.6.24	At that time Yeshua 
MAT.6.25	“Therefore I say to you: “Do not be anxious for the food for your souls nor for the clothing for your body, because the soul is more precious than food and the body than clothing.”
MAT.6.26	“Behold the birds of the sky which sow not nor reap nor gather into barns, but your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not more precious than they?”
MAT.6.27	“Who among you, of those who are anxious, is able to add to his height one cubit?”
MAT.6.28	“If this is the case, why are you anxious for clothes? Behold the lilies of Sharon in growing they neither spin nor weave”.
MAT.6.29	“But I say to you that King Solomon, in all his glory, was not clothed like these”.
MAT.6.30	“If The Mighty One clothes the straw which is left in the standing grain, which is fresh today and tomorrow is dried up and is placed into the oven, so much the more will He clothe you who are little of faith”
MAT.6.31	“If the Mighty One so thinks of you, do not be anxious saying what shall we eat and what shall we drink?”
MAT.6.32	“because all these things the bodies seek. But your Father Who is in heaven knows that you need all these things”.
MAT.6.33	“Seek first the Kingdom of Elohim 
MAT.6.34	“Do not be anxious for tomorrow because tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for itself is today with its trouble”.
MAT.7.1	“Judge not lest you be judged”.
MAT.7.2	“With what judgment you judge and with what measure you use, it will be measured to you”.
MAT.7.3	“Why do you see the straw in the eyes of the other person but not see the beam in your own eyes”
MAT.7.4	“How is it that you say to the other person: ‘Wait for me awhile and I will cast the straw out of your eyes’, and behold the beam is in your own eyes?”
MAT.7.5	“Hypocrite, first cast the beam out of your eyes and afterwards you will cast the straw out of the eyes of your fellowman”
MAT.7.6	Again he said to them: “Do not give holy flesh to dogs nor place your pearls before swine lest they chew them before you and turn to tear you to pieces”.
MAT.7.7	“Ask from The Mighty One and it will be given to you, seek and you will find, knock and it will be opened to you”.
MAT.7.8	“Everyone who asks will receive, by the one who seeks it will be found, and to the one who calls it will be opened”
MAT.7.9	“Who is there among you whose son asks him for a piece of bread and he gives him a stone?”
MAT.7.10	“Or if he should ask for a fish, he gives him a snake?”
MAT.7.11	“But if you being evil come to place give good gifts to one another, so much the more your Father Who is in heaven will give His Good Ruach 
MAT.7.12	“Everything you wish that men should do to you, do to them; this is the Torah and the words of the prophets”.
MAT.7.13	At that time Yeshua 
MAT.7.14	“How narrow is the gate and marked by grief the Way that leads straight to life and few are those who find it”
MAT.7.15	Again he said to them: “Beware of false prophets who come to you in wool clothing like sheep, but inside are tearing wolves”
MAT.7.16	“By their deeds you will know them. Does a man gather grapes from thorns or figs from briars?”
MAT.7.17	“Every good tree makes good fruit and every bad tree makes bad fruit”
MAT.7.18	“The good tree cannot make bad fruit nor can the bad tree make good fruit”
MAT.7.19	“Every tree which does not make good fruit is cut down and burned in the fire”
MAT.7.20	“Therefore it is according to fruits, that is, by their deeds, you will know them”
MAT.7.21	“Because not everyone who says unto me, Adonai 
MAT.7.22	“Many will say to me in that day, ‘Adonai 
MAT.7.23	“Then I will say to them: I never knew you. Depart from me all you workers of iniquity”
MAT.7.24	Again he said to them: “Everyone who hears these my words and does them is like a wise man who built his house on a rock”.
MAT.7.25	“The rain came down against it and the winds beat it and it did not fall because its foundation was a rock”
MAT.7.26	“Everyone who hears these my words and does not do them is like a foolish man who built his house upon the sand.”
MAT.7.27	“The rains came down, the floods came and fell against it and it fell with a great fall”.
MAT.7.28	While Yeshua 
MAT.7.29	because he was preaching to them with great power, not as the rest of the Torah-teachers 
MAT.8.1	It came to pass when Yeshua 
MAT.8.2	Then behold a leper came and did homage to him saying: ‘Adon 
MAT.8.3	Yeshua 
MAT.8.4	Then Yeshua 
MAT.8.5	It came to pass when he entered K’far-Nachum 
MAT.8.6	saying: ‘Adon 
MAT.8.7	Yeshua 
MAT.8.8	The captain of hundreds answered and said to him: ‘Adon 
MAT.8.9	‘I am a sinful man and I have authority under the P’rushim 
MAT.8.10	Yeshua 
MAT.8.11	“I say to you that many will come from the East and from the West and will rest with Avraham 
MAT.8.12	“but the sons of the Kingdom will be cast into the darkness of Gei-Hinnom 
MAT.8.13	Then Yeshua 
MAT.8.14	At that time, Yeshua 
MAT.8.15	He touched her hand, and the fever left her. Then she arose and ministered to him.
MAT.8.16	At the time of evening they brought to him those seized by demons and he healed them by his word alone and he healed every sickness,
MAT.8.17	to fulfill what was said by Yesha’yahu 
MAT.8.18	It came to pass after this Yeshua 
MAT.8.19	Then a scribe came to him and said to him: ‘Teacher I will follow you wherever you go’
MAT.8.20	Yeshua 
MAT.8.21	One of his disciples said to him: ‘Allow me to go and bury my father’
MAT.8.22	Yeshua 
MAT.8.23	It came to pass when Yeshua 
MAT.8.24	A great storm came on the sea, and the waves were coming on excessively, and the boat was thought to be breaking up.
MAT.8.25	His disciples came to him and begged him saying: ‘O our Adon 
MAT.8.26	He said to them: “Why do you look at one another, O you of little faith?”. He arose and commanded the sea and the winds that they should be quiet and immediately they became quiet.
MAT.8.27	When the men who were there saw, they marveled and said: ‘Who is this that the winds and the sea do his will’?
MAT.8.28	It came to pass when he crossed over the sea and passed by the region beyond the sea into the realm of Gaderi 
MAT.8.29	They cried out to him saying: ‘What is between you and us, Yeshua 
MAT.8.30	There, near them, were herds of many swine, feeding.
MAT.8.31	So the demons entreated him: ‘Since we have to go out from here, grant us authority to go into these swine.
MAT.8.32	He said to them: “Go”. The demons went out from the men and entered the swine, and all the herd went in sudden haste, slipped off into the sea and died in the water.
MAT.8.33	Those who were feeding 
MAT.8.34	They went out to meet Yeshua 
MAT.9.1	Then Yeshua 
MAT.9.2	They brought to him one who was sick with contractions, lying upon his bed. Yeshua 
MAT.9.3	Some of the Torah-teachers 
MAT.9.4	Yeshua 
MAT.9.5	“Which is easier to say: ‘Your sins are forgiven, or, rise walk’?
MAT.9.6	“But to inform you that the Son of Man is able to forgive sins on earth”; then he said to the sick man. “Arise and take your bed and walk”.
MAT.9.7	He arose and went to his house.
MAT.9.8	The crowds saw, feared exceedingly, and praised The Mighty One Who had given power to men to do such things.
MAT.9.9	It came to pass when Yeshua 
MAT.9.10	He brought him to his house to eat. It came to pass while he was eating, that behold many tax collectors and sinners were at the table and behold they were dining with Yeshua 
MAT.9.11	The P’rushim 
MAT.9.12	Yeshua 
MAT.9.13	“Go and learn that which is written: ‘I desire kindness and not sacrifice’; I have not come to call to restore the righteous but the ungodly”
MAT.9.14	Then the disciples of Yochanan 
MAT.9.15	Yeshua 
MAT.9.16	“No man wastes a piece of new garment on an old garment because the force of the piece stretches the worn out garment and it tears more”
MAT.9.17	“Nor do they put new wine into old vessels lest the vessels break, and the wine spills out and the vessels perish. But, new wine is for new vessels and both of them are preserved”.
MAT.9.18	It came to pass when he had spoken to them, a captain approached and bowed down to him saying: ‘Adon 
MAT.9.19	Yeshua 
MAT.9.20	Behold a woman with a flow of blood for twelve years came behind him and touched the fringe of his garment.
MAT.9.21	She was saying in her heart: ‘If only I touch his garment. I will immediately be healed’.
MAT.9.22	He turned and said to her: “Courage my daughter. By Yehovah 
MAT.9.23	It came to pass when he entered the house of the captain, he saw many people weeping.
MAT.9.24	He said to them: “Go outside all of you and stop weeping because the girl is asleep and not dead”. But in their eyes he was as one who jests. They were saying: ‘Have we not seen that she is dead’.
MAT.9.25	When he had put them outside, Yeshua 
MAT.9.26	This report went out in all that land.
MAT.9.27	Yeshua 
MAT.9.28	He came to the house, and the blind men drew near to him. He asked them: “Do you believe that I able to do this? They said to him: ‘Yes Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth]’. He said:
MAT.9.29	“Your faith will heal you”
MAT.9.30	The eyes of the two men were immediately opened and they saw. He commanded them saying: “Be careful lest the matter be made known”
MAT.9.31	As for them they went out and made it known in all that land.
MAT.9.32	Yeshua 
MAT.9.33	He cast out the demon so that the dumb man spoke. The crowds were amazed and said: ‘We have not seen it like this in Y’sra’el 
MAT.9.34	The P’rushim 
MAT.9.35	He went around all the cities and towns teaching in the synagogues and preaching the good news and healing every illness and every sickness.
MAT.9.36	Yeshua 
MAT.9.37	Then he said to his disciples: “The standing grain is much but the reapers are few”.
MAT.9.38	“Entreat, now, ADON 
MAT.10.1	Then Yeshua 
MAT.10.2	These are the names of the twelve apostles: Shim’on 
MAT.10.3	Philip 
MAT.10.4	Shim’on 
MAT.10.5	These twelve Yeshua 
MAT.10.6	“Go to the sheep who have strayed from the house of Y’sra’el 
MAT.10.7	“Preach to them that the Kingdom of heaven will be fulfilled”.
MAT.10.8	“Heal the sick, restore life to the dead, cleanse the lepers and cast out demons from men. Do not take wages. Freely you have received, freely you shall give”.
MAT.10.9	“Do not heap up silver and gold; nor have wealth in your purse”,
MAT.10.10	“nor change of clothes, nor shoes, nor a staff in your hand. The workman is worthy to receive enough for his food”.
MAT.10.11	“In every city and in every town that you enter ask who is the good man among them and there remain until you go out”.
MAT.10.12	“When you enter into the house, give to them a shalom saying: Shalom to this house; shalom to all who dwell in it”.
MAT.10.13	“If that house should be worthy, your shalom will come upon it, but if it is not worthy, your shalom will return to you”.
MAT.10.14	“If one does not receive you or listen to you, you shall go out from that house and shake off the dust from your feet”.
MAT.10.15	“Truly I say unto you, it will be better for Sodom 
MAT.10.16	“Behold I send you like sheep in the midst of wolves. Be as crafty as serpents and humble as doves”.
MAT.10.17	“Beware of men. They will not deliver you up in their congregations and houses of assembly”,
MAT.10.18	“but to governors and kings. You will be able bear witness on my behalf to them and to the Goyim 
MAT.10.19	“When they seize you, do not consider what you will say, because in the hour that you are in need an answer will come to you”.
MAT.10.20	“It will not be you who speak, but Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit 
MAT.10.21	“Brother will deliver up brother to death and a father his son; the sons will rise up against their fathers and lead them unto death”.
MAT.10.22	“You will become a ridicule 
MAT.10.23	Again Yeshua 
MAT.10.24	“No disciple is greater than his Rabbi, nor is the slave greater than his Adon 
MAT.10.25	“It is sufficient for the disciple to be like his Rabbi and for the slave to be like his Adon 
MAT.10.26	“Do not fear them, because there is nothing which will not be seen, nor hidden which will not be made known”.
MAT.10.27	“That which I say to you in the darkness, say it in the light; that which you hear by the ear, tell it in the council place”.
MAT.10.28	“Do not fear those who kill bodies, who have no power to kill souls; but fear The One who has power to destroy the soul and body in Gei-Hinnom 
MAT.10.29	“Are not two sparrows sold for a small coin and not one of them will fall to the earth without the will of your Father Who is in heaven?”
MAT.10.30	“Are not all the hairs of your head numbered?”
MAT.10.31	“Do not fear, because you are more precious than the sparrows”.
MAT.10.32	“He who confesses me before men I will confess before my Father Who is in heaven”.
MAT.10.33	“He who denies me before men, I will deny before my father Who is in heaven”.
MAT.10.34	In that hour Yeshua 
MAT.10.35	“I have come to separate mankind, the son from his father and the daughter from her mother”.
MAT.10.36	“The enemy is to be loved ones”.
MAT.10.37	“He who loves his father and his mother more than me, I am not suitable for him”.
MAT.10.39	“He who loves his life will lose it, he who loses it for my sake will find it”.
MAT.10.40	“He who receives you, receives me and he who receives me, receives the One Who sent me”.
MAT.10.41	“He who receives a prophet in the name of ‘a prophet’, will receive the reward of the prophet; he who receives a righteous one in the name of ‘a righteous one’, will receive the reward of the righteous one”.
MAT.10.42	“He who gives a vessel of cold water to one of my little disciples in the name of ‘my disciple’, truly I say to you that he will not lose his reward”.
MAT.11.1	It came to pass; when Yeshua 
MAT.11.2	Yochanan 
MAT.11.3	saying to him: ‘Are you the One who is to come or should we expect another?’
MAT.11.4	Yeshua 
MAT.11.5	“the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are revived, and the poor are acquitted”.
MAT.11.6	“Blessed 
MAT.11.7	It came to pass as they were going that Yeshua 
MAT.11.8	“Or what did you go out to see? Do you think that Yochanan 
MAT.11.9	“If so, what did you go out to see, a prophet? Truly I say to you that this one is greater than a prophet”.
MAT.11.10	“This is he about whom it is written: ‘Behold I am sending my messenger and he will make the Way clear before you’”
MAT.11.11	Again Yeshua 
MAT.11.12	“From his days until now ‘The Kingdom of heaven’ has been preached and senseless persons have been tearing it to pieces”.
MAT.11.13	“For all the prophets and the law spoke concerning Yochanan 
MAT.11.14	“If you wish to receive it, he is Eliyahu 
MAT.11.15	“He who has ears to hear, let him hear”.
MAT.11.16	Again Yeshua 
MAT.11.17	“saying: ‘We sang to you and you did not dance; we wailed for you and you did not weep’”.
MAT.11.18	“Because Yochanan 
MAT.11.19	“But the Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say concerning him: ‘He is a glutton, a drunkard, and a friend to tax collectors and sinners. So fools judge the wise”.
MAT.11.20	Then Yeshua 
MAT.11.21	“Woe to you Korazin 
MAT.11.22	“Truly I say to you, it shall be easier for Tzor 
MAT.11.23	“You K’far-Nachum 
MAT.11.24	“Truly I say to you that it shall be easier for the land of Sodom 
MAT.11.25	At that time Yeshua 
MAT.11.26	“Truly this is because it is good in Your eyes, my Father”.
MAT.11.27	“All has been given to me from my Father. There is none who knows the Son, but the Father alone, and the Father no one knows, but the Son and to whomever the Son wishes to reveal Him”
MAT.11.28	“Come unto me all you who are weary and who are enduring labour, and I will help you to bear your yoke”
MAT.11.29	“Take my yoke as your yoke and learn of me that I am meek and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls,
MAT.11.30	“Because my yoke is easy and my burden is light”
MAT.12.1	At that time Yeshua 
MAT.12.2	The P’rushim 
MAT.12.3	Yeshua 
MAT.12.4	“in the house of Elohim 
MAT.12.5	“Also in the Torah have you not read that the priests in the temple sometimes Profane 
MAT.12.6	“Truly I say to you that This Temple is greater”.
MAT.12.7	“If you had known what this means: ‘I desire kindness and not sacrifice’ you would not have convicted the innocent”
MAT.12.8	“For the Son of Man is Adon 
MAT.12.9	It came to pass at the end of those days that Yeshua 
MAT.12.10	A man was there with a withered hand: so they asked him saying: ‘Is it permissible to heal him on the Shabbat 
MAT.12.11	He said to them: “Who among you has a sheep that falls into a pit on the Shabbat 
MAT.12.12	“So much the more precious is a man than that. Therefore it is permissible for man to be made well on the Shabbat 
MAT.12.13	Then he said to the man: “Stretch out your hand”. He stretched it out and it was restored like the other.
MAT.12.14	Then the P’rushim 
MAT.12.15	It came to pass after this that Yeshua 
MAT.12.16	He commanded them saying not to reveal him
MAT.12.17	in order to fulfill what was spoken by Yesha’yahu 
MAT.12.18	“Behold My slave whom I uphold, My Chosen One in whom my soul is delighted: I have put My Ruach [Spirit 
MAT.12.19	“He will not cry out nor lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in the street”.
MAT.12.20	“A crushed reed he will not break and a dimly burning wick he will not quench; he will establish justice according to the truth; he will not fail or be discouraged until he establishes justice in the earth”
MAT.12.21	“and the Goyim 
MAT.12.22	Then there was brought to him a blind and dumb man who was demon possessed; he healed him. The crowds saw
MAT.12.23	and were amazed and said: ‘Is this not the Son of David 
MAT.12.24	The P’rushim 
MAT.12.25	Yeshua 
MAT.12.26	“If Satan 
MAT.12.27	“If I cast out demons by Ba’al-zevuv 
MAT.12.28	“But if I cast out demons by The Ruach [Spirit 
MAT.12.29	“How shall a man be able to enter the house of the strong man to take his goods unless he binds him first? Then he shall plunder his house”.
MAT.12.30	“Whoever is not with me is against me. Whoever does not join himself to me denies me”
MAT.12.31	“Therefore I say to you that every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven the sons of men, but blasphemy of The Ruach [Spirit 
MAT.12.32	“Everyone who says a word against The Son of Man, it will be forgiven him. But everyone who says a word against Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit 
MAT.12.33	“Determine the tree good because of good fruit, or the tree bad because of bad fruit; because the tis; from the fruit the tree will be known”
MAT.12.34	“Family of vipers, how can you speak good things when you are evil?. Surely the mouth opens, the heart speaks”
MAT.12.35	“A good man from the treasure of a good heart brings forth good; an evil man from the treasure of an evil heart brings forth evil”
MAT.12.36	“I say to you that for all the words which a man shall speak he will be obliged to give an account on the day of judgment”.
MAT.12.37	“According to your words you will be judged and according to your deeds you will be convicted”.
MAT.12.38	At that time, some of the P’rushim 
MAT.12.39	He said to them: “An evil and ungodly generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Yonah 
MAT.12.40	“For as he was in the bowels 
MAT.12.41	“The men of Ninevah will rise up in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it, because they turned in repentance at the words of Yonah 
MAT.12.42	“The queen of Sheba, will rise up in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold! I am greater than Solomon”
MAT.12.43	“When the unclean Spirit 
MAT.12.44	“Then he says: ‘I will return to my house from which I came out, and he goes and finds it empty, safe and ready”
MAT.12.45	“Then he takes seven spirits more evil than himself, and they go with him and they dwell there, and the latter state of the man is worse than his first. Thus it will be with this evil generation”.
MAT.12.46	While he was speaking to all the crowds, behold his mother and his brothers were standing outside seeking him to speak with him.
MAT.12.47	A man said to him: ‘Look! your mother and your brothers are seeking to see you’
MAT.12.48	He answered the one who spoke to him: “Who are my brothers and who is my mother?”
MAT.12.49	He stretched out his hands to his disciples and said: “These are my mother and brothers”
MAT.12.50	“Everyone who does the will of my Father Who is in heaven, is my brother, my sister, and my mother.”
MAT.13.1	On that day Yeshua 
MAT.13.2	Crowds joined themselves to him until he needed to enter a boat; the whole crowd was standing on the shore.
MAT.13.3	He spoke to them many things in parables and said to them: “A man went forth from his house in the morning to sow his seed.”
MAT.13.4	“In his sowing some of it fell on the road, and the birds ate it.”
MAT.13.5	“Some of it fell among rocks where there was no density of soil, and when it sprang up it withered because there was not much soil there.”
MAT.13.6	“When the sun above it became warm, it was burned and dried up because it had no root.”
MAT.13.7	“Some of it fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew and darkened it.”
MAT.13.8	“Some of it fell on good ground and made fruit and produced, the first a hundredfold, the second sixty and the third thirty.”
MAT.13.9	“Whoever has ears to hear let him hear”
MAT.13.10	Then his disciples drew near to him and his disciples said to him: ‘Why do you speak in parables?’
MAT.13.11	He said: “To you it has been given to know ‘the Kingdom of heaven’ but not to them.”
MAT.13.12	“Whoever has, more will be given to him but whoever has nothing, that which he thinks he has will be taken from him”
MAT.13.13	“For this reason I speak in parables because they see but do not see, hear but do not hear,”
MAT.13.14	“in order to fulfill what was said through Yesha’yahu 
MAT.13.15	“Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they, seeing with their eyes, and hearing with their ears, and understanding with their heart, return, and be healed.”
MAT.13.16	“Blessed 
MAT.13.17	“Truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.”
MAT.13.18	“But hear you the parable of the sower.”
MAT.13.19	“The Sower is The Son of Man, and the seed which fell on the road is everyone who hears ‘The Kingdom of heaven’ and does not understand it. Satan 
MAT.13.20	“That which fell among the rocks is the one who hears the word of Elohim 
MAT.13.21	“But he is without root and is confused and when a little trouble and distress come to him because of the word, Satan 
MAT.13.22	“That which fell among the thorns, this is the one who hears the word and in his desire to gather wealth, Satan 
MAT.13.23	“That which fell into the good earth is the one who hears the word and understands it and makes fruit, that is, from good works. He brings forth from the first a hundred, from the second sixty, and from the third thirty. As for the hundred, this is the one purified of heart and sanctified of body. As for the sixty, this is the one separated from women. As for the thirty, this is the one sanctified in matrimony, in body and in heart.”
MAT.13.24	He set before them another parable. “The Kingdom of heaven is like a man who sows good seed in his field.”
MAT.13.25	“It came to pass when the men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed tares over the wheat, and he went away.”
MAT.13.26	“It came to pass that when the herb grew up to make fruit, then he saw the tares”.
MAT.13.27	“The servants of the landowner drew near to him and said to him; ‘Sir, did you not sow good seed, then where did the tares come from?’”
MAT.13.28	“He said to them, ‘My enemy did this! His servants said to him: ‘We will uproot the tares’”
MAT.13.29	“He said to them: ‘No, lest you uproot the wheat’”
MAT.13.30	“But let them remain together and grow up until the harvest and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers: ‘Gather the tares first and bind them into individual bundles for burning and the wheat put into the granary’”
MAT.13.31	He set before them another parable. “The Kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard which a man takes and sows in the field.”
MAT.13.32	“It is smaller than all garden herbs, but when it grows up it is greater than all herbs and is made into a great tree until the birds of heaven withdraw into its branches.”
MAT.13.33	He spoke to them another parable. “The Kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman puts into three measures of flour and it leavens all of it”.
MAT.13.34	All of these parables Yeshua 
MAT.13.35	to fulfill what was said according to the prophet: “I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter riddles from ancient times”
MAT.13.36	Then Yeshua 
MAT.13.37	He answered and said to them: “The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,
MAT.13.38	“and the field is this world, the good seed are the righteous. The tares are the ungodly,”
MAT.13.39	“and the enemy who sowed them is Satan 
MAT.13.40	“As the reapers gather the tares to burn in the fire, so will it be at the end of the days.”
MAT.13.41	“The Son of Man will send His angels to uproot from his Kingdom all stumbling blocks, and all who do iniquity,”
MAT.13.42	“and they will cast them into the pyre of fire; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”
MAT.13.43	“Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear”.
MAT.13.44	Again Yeshua 
MAT.13.45	“Again the Kingdom of heaven is like a certain merchant seeking precious stones.”
MAT.13.46	“When he finds a good one, he sells all which he has and buys it”
MAT.13.47	“The Kingdom of heaven is like a net in the midst of the sea in which are gathered all kinds of fish.”
MAT.13.48	“When it is full, they draw it out on the shore, and the fishermen go forth and choose the good for their vessels and the bad they cast away.”
MAT.13.49	“Thus it will be at the end of days; the angels will go forth and separate the ungodly from the midst of the righteous.”
MAT.13.50	“Then they shall cast them into the pyre of fire; in that place shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth”
MAT.13.51	He said to them: “Have you understood this?” They said: ‘Yes’.
MAT.13.52	And Yeshua 
MAT.13.53	It came to pass after this, when Yeshua 
MAT.13.54	He came into his own country and was teaching the people in the synagogues. The P’rushim 
MAT.13.55	‘Is this not the son of the smith and Miryam 
MAT.13.56	‘and his sisters? Do you not know all these who are with us?. From where did all these things come to this one?’
MAT.13.57	So they were confused about him. Yeshua 
MAT.13.58	Then he did not wish to do there any sign because of their unbelief.
MAT.14.1	At that time Herod 
MAT.14.2	He said to his servants: ‘Behold I believe that Yochanan 
MAT.14.3	This happened because Herod 
MAT.14.4	Yochanan 
MAT.14.5	Then behold Herod 
MAT.14.6	On the feast of Herod 
MAT.14.7	He swore to give her whatever she asked from him.
MAT.14.8	The girl being instructed by her mother, asked for the head of Yochanan 
MAT.14.9	The king was very sad because of the oath which he had made before those invited. But he commanded to do so
MAT.14.10	and sent to kill Yochanan 
MAT.14.11	They brought the head of Yochanan 
MAT.14.12	Then the disciples of Yochanan 
MAT.14.13	When Yeshua 
MAT.14.14	When they came out he saw behind him a numerous people; so he extended kindness to them and healed all their diseases.
MAT.14.15	At evening time his disciples came to him and said to him: ‘This place is limited and the time is advancing. Let the crowds go into the towns that they might buy food for themselves’.
MAT.14.16	Yeshua 
MAT.14.17	They answered: ‘We have nothing here except five loaves and two fish’.
MAT.14.18	He said to them: “Bring them to me”.
MAT.14.19	Then he commanded that the people should sit on the grass. When they sat he took the five loaves and two fish and as he looked into heaven he Blessed 
MAT.14.20	All of them ate and were satisfied. They also ate the fish according to what they desired. After they had finished, they took the fragments, which remained, and filled twelve baskets with them.
MAT.14.21	The number of those eating was five thousand men apart from women and children.
MAT.14.22	After this, he commanded his disciples to assemble in a boat that they might go before him to the city to which the crowds were going.
MAT.14.23	After he left the crowds he went up on a mountain and prayed alone. At the time of evening he was standing alone.
MAT.14.24	The boat was in the midst of the sea and the waves of the sea were driving it because the wind was contrary.
MAT.14.25	At the fourth watch of the night Yeshua 
MAT.14.26	When his disciples saw him walking on the sea they were alarmed, thinking he was a demon, and from the greatness of their fear they were crying out.
MAT.14.27	Then Yeshua 
MAT.14.28	Kefa 
MAT.14.29	Yeshua 
MAT.14.30	But when he saw the strength of the wind he feared exceedingly and as he began to sink cried out and said: ‘My Adon 
MAT.14.31	Immediately Yeshua 
MAT.14.32	When they went up into the boat, the wind became quiet,
MAT.14.33	and those in the boat did homage to him and said: ‘Truly, you are the Son of The Mighty One’.
MAT.14.34	They crossed over and they came to the land of Ginosar 
MAT.14.35	When the people of the place recognized him they sent into all that kingdom and brought to him all who were sick with various kinds of diseases.
MAT.14.36	They implored him that he might be pleased to allow them to touch the hem of his garment, and each one who touched it was healed.
MAT.15.1	Then the Torah-teachers 
MAT.15.2	‘Why do your disciples transgress the ordinances of antiquity by not washing their hands before eating?’
MAT.15.3	Yeshua 
MAT.15.4	For The Mighty One said: “Honour your father and your mother and he who curses his father and mother will surely be put to death”
MAT.15.5	“But you say that ‘whoever says to his father and his mother; in regard to any donation he might give; ‘Whatever I have that would help you has been given to Elohim 
MAT.15.6	“So he does not honour his father and his mother, and you despise the words of The Mighty One because of your ordinances”.
MAT.15.7	“Woe, hypocrites, behold Yesha’yahu 
MAT.15.8	“Thus Yehovah 
MAT.15.9	“And their reverence towards Me, which is taught, is the commandments of men”.
MAT.15.10	Yeshua 
MAT.15.11	“That which enters through the mouth does not soil the man, but that which goes out of the mouth soils the man”
MAT.15.12	Then his disciples came to him and said to him: ‘Know that the P’rushim 
MAT.15.13	Yeshua 
MAT.15.14	“Leave them alone because the blind are leading the blind, and if a blind man leads another who is blind, they will both fall into a pit”.
MAT.15.15	Kefa 
MAT.15.16	Yeshua 
MAT.15.17	“Do you not understand that everything that enters through the mouth goes into the belly and all of it goes on to the natural place?”
MAT.15.18	“But that which goes out through the mouth is moved by the heart; this is what soils the man.”
MAT.15.19	“Because the defiled heart brings forth deceitfulness, murder, adulteries, robberies, the witness of liars and curses”.
MAT.15.20	“All these things are what soil the man. Indeed eating without washing the hands does not soil the man”.
MAT.15.21	After Yeshua 
MAT.15.22	Then there came to him a certain Kenani 
MAT.15.23	Yeshua 
MAT.15.24	Yeshua 
MAT.15.25	Then the woman did homage to him and said: ‘My Adon 
MAT.15.26	Yeshua 
MAT.15.27	The woman answered: ‘Often the dogs eat the pieces of bread that fall from the table of their master’.
MAT.15.28	Yeshua 
MAT.15.29	When Yeshua 
MAT.15.30	he saw many people among whom were many lame, leprous, those who limped, and many others; they fell at his feet and he healed them.
MAT.15.31	The people were amazed at how the dumb were speaking and the lame were walking and the blind were seeing; all of them were praising The Most High.
MAT.15.32	Then Yeshua 
MAT.15.33	His disciples answered him: ‘Where will we be able to find bread in this wilderness to satisfy the people?’
MAT.15.34	Yeshua 
MAT.15.35	So Yeshua 
MAT.15.36	He took the seven loaves and the fish and broke them and gave them to his disciples and they gave to the people.
MAT.15.37	All of them ate and were satisfied and from that which was remaining they filled seven baskets.
MAT.15.38	Those who were eating were by number, four thousand men besides women and children.
MAT.15.39	After this Yeshua 
MAT.16.1	Tz’dukim 
MAT.16.2	Yeshua 
MAT.16.3	“Then in the morning you say: ‘Today it will rain because the sky is dark’. If so, you know the law regarding the appearance of the sky, but you do not know the law regarding the times”.
MAT.16.4	“The offspring of evil-doers ask for a sign, but no sign will be given them except the sign of Yonah 
MAT.16.5	When Yeshua 
MAT.16.6	And Yeshua 
MAT.16.7	They began to discuss this among themselves, saying, “He said that because we did not bring any bread.”
MAT.16.8	Yeshua 
MAT.16.9	“Do you not remember the five loaves and the five thousand men”,
MAT.16.10	“Or the seven loaves and the four thousand men, how many baskets were left over?”
MAT.16.11	“Therefore you should understand that I am not speaking of natural loaves”
MAT.16.12	“but I am saying to you that you should beware of the teachings of the P’rushim 
MAT.16.13	Yeshua 
MAT.16.14	They said unto him: “Some say ‘he is Yochanan 
MAT.16.15	Yeshua 
MAT.16.16	Shim’on 
MAT.16.17	Yeshua 
MAT.16.18	“I say to you: ‘You are Even 
MAT.16.19	“because I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”
MAT.16.20	Then he commanded his disciples not to say that he is Ha-Moshiach 
MAT.16.21	From then on Yeshua 
MAT.16.22	Kefa 
MAT.16.23	Yeshua 
MAT.16.24	Then Yeshua 
MAT.16.25	“Everyone who wishes to save his soul will lose it for my sake, and he who loses his life in this world for my sake will save his soul for the life of the world to come”.
MAT.16.26	“What profit is there for a man if he should gain the whole world and lose his soul forever; what good exchange does a man make if, for present things that are spoiled, he should give his soul to the judgment of Gei-Hinnom 
MAT.16.27	“Because the Son of The Mighty One will come in the glory of his Father Who is in heaven with his angels to reward each man according to his work”.
MAT.16.28	“Truly I say to you there are some of those standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of The Mighty One coming in his Kingdom.”
MAT.17.1	After six days Yeshua 
MAT.17.2	While he was praying he was changed before them and the skin of his face shone like the sun and his garments became white like snow.
MAT.17.3	Then Moshe 
MAT.17.4	When they went away, then Kefa 
MAT.17.5	While he was still speaking, behold a cloud covered them and they were greatly alarmed. While they were under the cloud they heard from the midst of the cloud a voice speaking and saying: “Behold, this is My Son My beloved, My delight is in him, you shall obey him”
MAT.17.6	The disciples heard, fell on their faces to the ground, and feared exceedingly.
MAT.17.7	When the Voice ceased, Yeshua 
MAT.17.8	They lifted up their eyes and saw no one except Yeshua 
MAT.17.9	Yeshua 
MAT.17.10	His disciples asked him saying: “Why do the Torah-teachers 
MAT.17.11	He answered them and said: “Indeed Eliyahu 
MAT.17.12	“I say to you, he has already come, they did not know him, and they did to him according to their desire. So they will do to the Son of Man”.
MAT.17.13	Then the disciples understood that regarding Yochanan 
MAT.17.14	It came to pass when he approached the crowds, a man came to him, bowing on his knees.
MAT.17.15	He said: ‘Have mercy on me my Adon 
MAT.17.16	I brought him to your disciples, but they were unable to heal him.
MAT.17.17	Yeshua 
MAT.17.18	And Yeshua 
MAT.17.19	The disciples drew near to Yeshua 
MAT.17.20	He said to them: “Because of the limitation of your faith. Truly I say to you, if there be any faith in you, as a grain of mustard, if you believe, you will say to this mountain depart and it will depart; nothing will be withheld from you.”
MAT.17.21	“But this kind of demon does not come out except by prayer and fasting.
MAT.17.22	They were in Galil 
MAT.17.23	“They will kill him and on the third day he will arise”.
MAT.17.24	The came to K’far-Nachum 
MAT.17.25	Thus they spoke. He went into the house and Yeshua 
MAT.17.26	He answered him: “From foreigners”. Yeshua 
MAT.17.27	He said to Kefa 
MAT.18.1	At that time the disciples drew near to Yeshua 
MAT.18.2	He called a small child and placed him in their midst.
MAT.18.3	He said: “I say to you, if you do not turn to become like this child, you will not enter the Kingdom of heaven”
MAT.18.5	“He who receives a child, like this, in my name, receives me”
MAT.18.6	“He who causes one of the little children who believe in me to stumble, it would be good for him to tie a millstone around his neck and be cast into the depths of the sea”.
MAT.18.7	“Woe to the inhabitants of the world because of confusion, because confusion must come”. He also said: “Woe to the man through whom the confusion comes”
MAT.18.8	“If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble cut it off and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life with one hand or lame than having two hands and two feet for you to be given to everlasting fire”
MAT.18.9	“If your eye should cause you to stumble, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and be given to Gei-Hinnom 
MAT.18.10	“Take heed lest you judge one of the little children. I say to you, their angels always see the sons of my Father Who is in heaven”,
MAT.18.11	“and the Son of Man is not saving the enemy”
MAT.18.12	“What is your opinion: If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them strays, will he not leave the ninety-nine in the mountains and go seek the one which has strayed?”
MAT.18.13	“If he should find it, truly I say to you he will rejoice over it more than the ninety-nine which did not go astray.”
MAT.18.14	“Thus, my Father Who is in heaven does not wish that any of these little children should e lost.”
MAT.18.15	At that time Yeshua 
MAT.18.16	“If he does not listen to you, reprove him before another; if by every oath he does not listen to you, add still one or two in order that your words might be before two or three witnesses, because by two or three witnesses a word will be established”.
MAT.18.17	“If by every oath he does not listen, tell it in the assembly; and if he does not listen to the assembly consider him as ostracized, an enemy and cruel”.
MAT.18.18	“Truly I say to you that every oath which you shall bind on earth will be bound in heaven and every oath which you shall loose on earth will be loosed in heaven”.
MAT.18.19	“Also, I say to you, if two of you wish to make peace on earth, everything which you ask will be yours from my Father Who is in heaven”.
MAT.18.20	“In every place where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in their midst”.
MAT.18.21	Then Kefa 
MAT.18.22	Yeshua 
MAT.18.23	At that time Yeshua 
MAT.18.24	“As he began to reckon one came who owed about ten thousand pieces of gold”.
MAT.18.25	“But he had nothing to give and his master commanded to sell him and his children and all which was his to repay the value”.
MAT.18.26	“The slave fell before his master and implored him to have pity on him and to be patient with him because he would repay everything”.
MAT.18.27	“Then his master had pity on him and forgave him everything”.
MAT.18.28	“But that slave went out and found one of his comrades who owed him a hundred pieces of money and he grasped him and struck him saying: Pay back what you owe”.
MAT.18.29	“So his comrade fell to the ground and began to plead with him, saying, ‘Trust me and be patient with me and I will repay everything’”.
MAT.18.30	“But he was not willing to listen to him; so he brought him to the prison until he repaid him everything”.
MAT.18.31	“The servants of the king saw that which he did and they were very angry and told their master”.
MAT.18.32	“Then his master called him and said to him: ‘Cursed slave, did I not forgive you all your debt when you placated me’”?
MAT.18.33	“‘So why did you not forgive your slave when he supplicated you, as I forgave you?’”
MAT.18.34	“His master was angry with him and commanded to afflict him until he should repay him all the debt”.
MAT.18.35	“Thus will my Father Who is in heaven do to you if you do not forgive each man his brother with a perfect heart”
MAT.19.1	It came to pass when Yeshua 
MAT.19.2	There followed him large crowds and he healed all of them.
MAT.19.3	Then the P’rushim 
MAT.19.4	He answered them: “Have you not read that He who made them of old, male and female He created them”.
MAT.19.5	He said: “Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and cleave 
MAT.19.6	“If so, they are not two but one flesh, and whatever The Creator has joined together man is unable to separate”
MAT.19.7	They said to him: ‘If so, why did Moshe 
MAT.19.8	He said to them: “Moshe 
MAT.19.9	“I say to you that everyone who leaves his wife and takes another, commits adultery; and he who takes her who has been divorced commits adultery”.
MAT.19.10	Then his disciples said to him: ‘If the matter of a man with his wife is so, it is not good to take her’.
MAT.19.11	He said to them: “This matter is not for everyone but for those to whom it has been given”.
MAT.19.12	“Because there are eunuchs from their birth; these are those who have not sinned. There are eunuchs made by man and there are self-made eunuchs who subdue their desire for the sake of the Kingdom of heaven; these are those who enter into great prominence. Whoever is able to understand let him understand”.
MAT.19.13	Then they brought children to him that he might lay his hand on them and pray for them, but his disciples were driving them away.
MAT.19.14	Yeshua 
MAT.19.15	So he laid his hand on them and went on from there.
MAT.19.16	A young man came to him doing homage to him and said to him: ‘Rabbi what good thing shall I do to acquire the life of the world to come?’
MAT.19.17	He answered him: “Why do you ask me about good? No man is good; because The Mighty One alone is good. But if you wish to enter life keep the commandments”.
MAT.19.18	He said to him: ‘What are they?’ Yeshua 
MAT.19.19	“Honour your father and your mother and love your neighbour as yourself”
MAT.19.20	The young man said to him: ‘All these I have kept, so what, yet, do I lack?’
MAT.19.21	Yeshua 
MAT.19.22	It came to pass when the young man heard he went away angry because he did not have much property.
MAT.19.23	Yeshua 
MAT.19.24	“Again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to enter the eye of a needle than a rich man the Kingdom of heaven”
MAT.19.25	The disciples heard and were exceedingly amazed and said to Yeshua 
MAT.19.26	He turned to them and said: “With man the matter is difficult, but with The Most High everything is easy”.
MAT.19.27	Kefa 
MAT.19.28	Yeshua 
MAT.19.29	“Everyone who leaves his house, and his brothers, also his sisters, his father, his mother, his wife and his children for my name will receive a hundred like them and will inherit the Kingdom of heaven”
MAT.19.30	“Many who are first will be last and many who are last will be first”
MAT.20.1	After this Yeshua 
MAT.20.2	“He hired them for one dinar a day and sent them into his vineyard”.
MAT.20.3	“He went out at the third hour of the day and saw others standing idle in the market place”.
MAT.20.4	“He said to them: ‘Go, also you, into my vineyard and that which is suitable I will give to you’.
MAT.20.5	“So they went. Then he came out again at noon and also at the ninth hour and did the same”.
MAT.20.6	“At the eleventh hour he went out also and found others standing and he said to them: ‘Why do you stand idle all day?’
MAT.20.7	“They answered him: ‘No man has hired us’. So he said to them: ‘Go, also, you into my vineyard’.
MAT.20.8	“It came to pass at evening, the master of the vineyard said to the officer over the laborers: ‘Call them that I might give to them their wages’. He began with the last and finished with the first”.
MAT.20.9	“The last received one dinar”.
MAT.20.10	“So the first thought they would receive more, but he gave only a dinar to each of them”.
MAT.20.11	“Then the first murmured against the master of the vineyard
MAT.20.12	“saying: ‘These last worked one hour and you have made them like us who have worked all day and in the heat’.
MAT.20.13	“He answered one of them and said to him: ‘My friend, I have done you no injustice. Did I not hire you for one dinar?’
MAT.20.14	‘Take it and go. If I wish to give this last like you’
MAT.20.15	‘may I not do according to my desire? Is there evil in your eyes when I am good?’
MAT.20.16	“So the last shall be first and the first last. Many are called but few are chosen”.
MAT.20.17	Yeshua 
MAT.20.18	“Behold we are going up to Yerushalayim 
MAT.20.19	“Also they will deliver him to the Goyim 
MAT.20.20	Then came the wife of Zavdai 
MAT.20.21	He said to her: “What do you wish?” She said: ‘That you command these my two sons to sit the one on your right and the other on your left in your Kingdom’.
MAT.20.22	Yeshua 
MAT.20.23	Then he said to them: “Drink my cup, but that you should sit on my left or my right is not for me to grant to you but to the one who is prepared before by my Father”
MAT.20.24	The ten heard and it was a matter of anger, in their eyes, in regard to the two brothers.
MAT.20.25	Yeshua 
MAT.20.26	“It will not be so among you, because he who wishes to be great among you will serve you”.
MAT.20.27	“He who among you who wishes to be first will be your slave”,
MAT.20.28	“just as the Son of Man did not come that they might serve him, but that he might serve and give himself as a ransom for many”.
MAT.20.29	They entered into Jericho and a crowd followed him.
MAT.20.30	Behold two blind men came out beside the road. They heard the noise of the multitude and asked what this might be. It was said to them: ‘The Prophet Yeshua 
MAT.20.31	But the crowd rebuked them saying: “Be silent”; they nevertheless were crying out saying: ‘Adon 
MAT.20.32	So Yeshua 
MAT.20.33	They said: ‘Adon 
MAT.20.34	Yeshua 
MAT.21.1	They drew near to Yerushalayim 
MAT.21.2	He said unto them: “Go into the fortress which is opposite you and immediately you will find a she-ass and her colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me”.
MAT.21.3	“If a man should say anything to you, tell him the Master has need of them and immediately he will let them go.”
MAT.21.4	All this was to fulfill the word of the prophet saying:
MAT.21.5	“Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion, shout, O daughter of Yerushalayim 
MAT.21.6	They went and did as Yeshua 
MAT.21.7	They brought the she-ass and the colt, and when the others had placed their garments and clothes upon them, Yeshua 
MAT.21.8	Many of the crowd spread out their garments in the road, and others cut branches from trees and cast them before him and behind him,
MAT.21.9	calling out saying: “Please! Deliver us! 
MAT.21.10	It came to pass afterwards, when Yeshua 
MAT.21.11	The people said to one another: ‘Yeshua 
MAT.21.12	Yeshua 
MAT.21.13	He said unto them: “It is written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations, but you have made it a cave of thieves’”.
MAT.21.14	Then the blind and lame came to him in the temple and he healed them.
MAT.21.15	The chief priests and the Torah-teachers 
MAT.21.16	and said to Him: ‘Have you not heard what these are saying?’ He answered them and said: “I heard them. Have you not read: ‘From the mouth of children and babes You have established strength’?”
MAT.21.17	He left and went out to Beit-Anyah 
MAT.21.18	It came to pass in the morning that he returned to the city hungry.
MAT.21.19	He saw a fig tree near the road and drew near to it but found nothing on it except leaves. He said to it: “May fruit never come forth from you”. Immediately the fig tree dried up.
MAT.21.20	The disciples saw, were amazed, and said: ‘How is it the fig tree dried up immediately?’
MAT.21.21	Yeshua 
MAT.21.22	“Everything which you shall ask in prayer while believing, you will receive”.
MAT.21.23	He went into the temple to teach and there came unto him the Torah-teachers 
MAT.21.24	Yeshua 
MAT.21.25	“The baptism of Yochanan 
MAT.21.26	‘If we say from men, we fear the crowd because all of them believe Yochanan 
MAT.21.27	So they said: ‘We do not know’. He said: “Also, I will not tell you by what power I work”
MAT.21.28	“What is your opinion? A certain man had two sons; he approached one and said to him: ‘Go my son today to work in my vineyard’.
MAT.21.29	“He said to him: ‘I do not wish to’. But afterward he repented and went”.
MAT.21.30	“He said to the other likewise and he answered him: ‘Here I am, Sir’, but he did not go”.
MAT.21.31	“Which of the two did the will of the father?” They said to him: ‘The first’. Yeshua 
MAT.21.32	“because Yochanan 
MAT.21.33	At that time Yeshua 
MAT.21.34	“It came to pass at the time of the gathering of the produce, he sent his servants to those who were working to receive his produce”.
MAT.21.35	“But the workers took his servants, struck the first, killed the second, and the third they stoned with stones”.
MAT.21.36	“Again he sent many more servants than the first and they did to them likewise”.
MAT.21.37	“Finally, he sent them his son saying: ‘They will honour my son’”.
MAT.21.38	“The workers saw his son and said to one another: ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and we will inherit his estate’.
MAT.21.39	“So they took him, cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him”.
MAT.21.40	“Now, when the Adon 
MAT.21.41	They answered him saying: “As for the wicked he will destroy them in misery and his vineyard he will give to other workers who will immediately give to him the portion of his produce.”
MAT.21.42	Yeshua 
MAT.21.43	“Therefore I say to you the Kingdom of heaven will be torn from you and given to a nation producing fruit”.
MAT.21.44	“He who falls upon this stone will be cast down; he who falls upon it will be broken apart.”
MAT.21.45	The chief priests and the P’rushim 
MAT.21.46	They sought to kill him but they feared the crowds to whom he was a Prophet.
MAT.22.1	Yeshua 
MAT.22.2	“The Kingdom of heaven is like a king who made a wedding ceremony”
MAT.22.3	“He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the wedding ceremony, but they did not wish to come”.
MAT.22.4	“He again sent other servants saying: ‘Tell those who are invited, behold I have prepared a feast, I have killed oxen and fowl, and all is ready. Come to the wedding ceremony’”.
MAT.22.5	“But they scorned and went away, some into the city and some to their businesses”.
MAT.22.6	“Others took his servants, abused them, and killed them”.
MAT.22.7	“The king heard this, was angry, sent out his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burnt their house with fire”.
MAT.22.8	“Then he said to his servants: ‘The marriage ceremony is ready, but those who were invited were unworthy’”.
MAT.22.9	“Now, go out unto the roads and all whom you find invite to the marriage ceremony”.
MAT.22.10	“His servants went out unto the ways and assembled all those who were found, good and bad; so the marriage ceremony was filled with those who were eating”.
MAT.22.11	“The king entered to see those who were eating and saw there a man who was not clothed in wedding garments”.
MAT.22.12	“He said to him: ‘My friend how did you come in here without wedding garments?’ He was silent”.
MAT.22.13	“Then the king said to his servants: ‘Bind his hands and feet and cast him to the lower most and lowest hell; in that place will be weeping and gnashing of teeth’”.
MAT.22.14	“Many are called but few are chosen.”
MAT.22.15	Then the P’rushim 
MAT.22.16	They sent him some of their disciples, with violent men from Herod 
MAT.22.17	‘Tell us your opinion: Is it right to give tribute to Caesar 
MAT.22.18	Yeshua 
MAT.22.19	“Show me a tax coin”. They brought a plain one to him.
MAT.22.20	He said to them: “Whose likeness is this and inscription?”
MAT.22.21	They said: ‘Caesar 
MAT.22.22	They heard and were amazed. They left him and went away.
MAT.22.23	On that day, the Tz’dukim 
MAT.22.24	saying: ‘Rabbi, Moshe 
MAT.22.25	‘Behold there were seven brothers among us. The first one took a wife, died without seed and his brother married his wife’.
MAT.22.26	‘Likewise the second and third unto the seventh’.
MAT.22.27	‘After them the woman died’.
MAT.22.28	‘Since she had already belonged to all of them, to which of the seven will she be a wife, in the resurrection?’
MAT.22.29	Yeshua 
MAT.22.30	“In the day of resurrection, men will not take women nor women men, but they will be like the angels of Elohim 
MAT.22.31	“Have you not read concerning the resurrection of the dead that Yehovah 
MAT.22.32	“I, Yehovah 
MAT.22.33	The crowds heard and were amazed at his wisdom.
MAT.22.34	When the P’rushim 
MAT.22.35	Then a scribe asked him, tempting him:
MAT.22.36	‘Rabbi, tell us which is the greatest commandment in the Torah?’
MAT.22.37	He said to him: “Thou shalt love Yehovah 
MAT.22.38	“This is the first and great commandment.”
MAT.22.39	“The second is like it: “Thou shalt love your neighbour as yourself”
MAT.22.40	“Upon these two commandments the whole law hangs and the prophets”
MAT.22.41	The P’rushim 
MAT.22.42	saying: “What is your opinion concerning Ha-Moshiach 
MAT.22.43	He said to them: “How is it that David 
MAT.22.44	“as it is written: “Yehovah 
MAT.22.45	“If David 
MAT.22.46	They were not able to answer him a word and from then on they feared to ask him anything.
MAT.23.1	Then Yeshua 
MAT.23.2	saying: “Upon the seat of Moshe 
MAT.23.3	“Now all which he says to you keep and do; but according to their ordinances and deeds do not do, because they say and do not”.
MAT.23.4	“They demand and set forth great burdens which the shoulders of men are not able to bear; but they themselves, even with their finger, are unwilling to move”.
MAT.23.5	“All their actions they do for the sake of appearances; they wear expensive garments and large tassels”,
MAT.23.6	“They love to recline first in the banquet halls, to be seated first at the synagogues”,
MAT.23.7	“to prostrate themselves in the streets, and to be called Rabbi”.
MAT.23.8	“But as for you, do not desire to be called Teacher because One is your Teacher, and all of you are brothers”.
MAT.23.9	“Call no man upon the earth ‘father’ because One is your Father Who is in heaven”.
MAT.23.10	“Do not be called Rabbi, because one is your Rabbi, Ha-Moshiach 
MAT.23.11	“The greatest among you will serve you”.
MAT.23.12	“He who exalts himself will be humbled; he who humbles himself will be exalted”.
MAT.23.13	“Woe to you P’rushim 
MAT.23.14	“Woe to you P’rushim 
MAT.23.15	“You encompass sea and land to bind the heart of one man to your faith and when he is bound he is doubly worse than before”.
MAT.23.16	“Woe to you council of the blind, who say that he who swears by the temple is not obligated, but he who vows by anything which is consecrated to the structure of the temple is not obligated to pay”,
MAT.23.17	“-mad and blind men, which is greater, the temple or that which is consecrated to the temple?-”
MAT.23.18	“and whoever swears by the altar is not obligated but he who swears that he will make an offering is obligated to give it”.
MAT.23.19	“Woe blind men, which is more, the gift or the altar, the temple or the gift?”
MAT.23.20	“He who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything which is in it”.
MAT.23.21	“He who swears by the temple swears by the temple and He Who dwells within it”.
MAT.23.22	“He who swears by the throne of Elohim 
MAT.23.23	“Woe to them, Torah-teachers 
MAT.23.24	“Offspring of blind leaders, who are strict in the matter of the gnat and swallow the camel”.
MAT.23.25	“Woe to you P’rushim 
MAT.23.26	“Hypocrites, cleanse first that which is inside in order that that which is outside might be pure”.
MAT.23.27	“Woe to you Torah-teachers 
MAT.23.28	“Thus you appear on the outside to be righteous to men, but within you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness”.
MAT.23.29	“Woe to you hypocrites, P’rushim 
MAT.23.30	“You say: ‘If we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have permitted putting the prophets to death’.
MAT.23.31	“In this you bear witness against yourselves that you are sons of those who killed the prophets”.
MAT.23.32	“You behave according to the deeds of your fathers”.
MAT.23.33	“Serpents, seed of vipers, how will you escape the judgment of Gei-Hinnom 
MAT.23.34	At that time Yeshua 
MAT.23.35	“In order to place upon you the blood of every righteous one which has been poured out upon the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous unto the blood of Z’kharyah Ben-Berekhyah 
MAT.23.36	“Truly I say to you that all these things will come upon this generation”,
MAT.23.37	“and upon Yerushalayim 
MAT.23.38	“Therefore you will leave your houses desolate”.
MAT.23.39	“Truly, I say to you, you will not see me from now on, until you will say: ‘Blessed 
MAT.24.1	It came to pass when Yeshua 
MAT.24.2	He said: “You see all these; truly I say to you that all will be destroyed and there will not be left there one stone upon another”.
MAT.24.3	As he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Kefa 
MAT.24.4	Yeshua 
MAT.24.5	“because many will come in my name saying: ‘I am the messiah, and they will lead many astray”.
MAT.24.6	“As for you, when you hear of wars and companies of hosts, beware lest you become foolish, because all this will occur, but the end will not be yet”.
MAT.24.7	“Nation will rise up against nation and kingdom against kingdom; there will be great tumults, grievous famine, and earthquake in places”.
MAT.24.8	“All of these are the beginning of sufferings”.
MAT.24.9	“Then they will bind you over for tribulation and will kill you, and you will be a reproach 
MAT.24.10	“Then many will be confused, deal treacherously with each other, and be enraged among themselves”.
MAT.24.11	“False prophets will arise and lead many astray”.
MAT.24.12	“When ungodliness multiplies, the love of many will grow weak”.
MAT.24.13	“Whoever waits until the end will be saved”.
MAT.24.14	“And this good news of the Kingdom of heaven will be preached in all the earth for a witness concerning me to all the nations and then the end will come”.
MAT.24.15	“He is the Anti-Moshiach 
MAT.24.16	“Then those who are in Y’huda 
MAT.24.17	“He who is upon the house, let him not come down to take anything out of his house”.
MAT.24.18	“He who is out in the field, let him not turn back to take his garment”.
MAT.24.19	“Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse children in those days”.
MAT.24.20	“Pray to The Mighty One that your flight will not be on the Shabbat 
MAT.24.21	“Because there will be great distress which has not been from the creation of the world until now and as will not be”.
MAT.24.22	“Except those days were few, no flesh would be saved; but for the sake of the chosen those days will be few”.
MAT.24.23	“At that time, if one should say to you: ‘Look! the messiah is here’ or ‘there’ do not believe it”.
MAT.24.24	“Because false messiahs and false prophets will arise and they will give signs and great wonders so that, if possible, they will come to lead the chosen astray”.
MAT.24.25	“Behold! I tell you before it happens”.
MAT.24.26	“Then if they should say to you: ‘Look! he is in the wilderness, do not go out, and; ‘Look! he is in the inner chamber’ do not believe it”.
MAT.24.27	Again Yeshua 
MAT.24.28	“Wherever the body is, there will be gathered the vultures”.
MAT.24.29	“At that time, after the tribulation of those days, the sun will grow dark, the moon will not give forth its light, the stars will fall from heaven, and the host of heaven will be shaken”.
MAT.24.30	“Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven and all the families of the earth will weep and will see the Son of Man on the clouds of heaven with a great host and with dreadful appearance”.
MAT.24.31	“He will send his angels with a trumpet and with a great shout to gather his chosen from the four winds of heaven, from one end of heaven unto the other”.
MAT.24.32	“From the fig tree learn the parable; when you see its branches and leaves sprouting know that summer is near”.
MAT.24.33	“So also when you see all these things you will know that He is near to the gates”,
MAT.24.34	“Truly I say to you: this generation will not pass away until all these things shall be done”.
MAT.24.35	“Heaven and earth will pass away”.
MAT.24.36	“But of that day or that time, there is no one who knows, not even the angels of heaven, but the Father only”.
MAT.24.37	Again Yeshua 
MAT.24.38	“Just as before the flood, they were eating, drinking, being fruitful and multiplying until the day when Noah entered the ark”.
MAT.24.39	“They did not know until the flood came upon them and destroyed them; so will be the coming of the Son of Man”.
MAT.24.40	“Then if there shall be two ploughing in a field, one righteous and the other ungodly, the one will be taken and the other left”.
MAT.24.41	“Two women will be grinding at a mill; one will be taken and the other left. This is because the angels at the end of the world will remove the stumbling blocks from the world and will separate the righteous from the ungodly”.
MAT.24.42	Then Yeshua 
MAT.24.43	“This you know, if one knew at what hour the thief was coming, he would watch and not allow him to dig into his house”.
MAT.24.44	“So you should be prepared, because you do not know at what hour the Son of Man is going to come”.
MAT.24.45	“What do you think of the faithful and wise slave whose Adon 
MAT.24.46	“Blessed 
MAT.24.47	“Truly I say to you that He will place him over His children”.
MAT.24.48	“But if that slave should be evil and say in his heart: ‘My Adōn 
MAT.24.49	“and should begin to beat the slave of his Adon 
MAT.24.50	“his Adon 
MAT.24.51	“He will divide him and place his portion with the hypocrites; in that place will be weeping and gnashing of teeth”.
MAT.25.1	Again Yeshua 
MAT.25.2	“Five of them were lazy fools and five of them were alert and wise”.
MAT.25.3	“The five foolish brought their lamps, but they brought no oil with them”.
MAT.25.4	“The wise brought oil in their vessels with their lamps”.
MAT.25.5	“The bridegroom was late and behold all of them lingered and slept”.
MAT.25.6	“It came to pass at midnight that behold a voice was heard: ‘Behold the bridegroom is coming; come to meet him’”.
MAT.25.7	“Then all those virgins came and trimmed their lamps”.
MAT.25.8	“The foolish virgins said to the wise: ‘Give us some of your oil because our lamps have gone out’”.
MAT.25.9	“The wise answered saying: ‘Go now to those who sell and buy for yourselves because there is not enough oil for us and you. We fear that it will be lacking for you’”.
MAT.25.10	“It came to pass when they went to buy, the Bridegroom came; those who were ready went with him into the marriage ceremony and the gate was closed”.
MAT.25.11	“Afterwards, the foolish came and called at the gate saying: ‘Our Adon 
MAT.25.12	“He answered them: ‘Truly I say to you, I do not know who you are’”.
MAT.25.13	“Be careful, therefore, because you do not know the day nor the hour when the Bridegroom will come”.
MAT.25.14	Again Yeshua 
MAT.25.15	“To one he gave five coins of gold, to the second he gave two coins of gold and to the third one, to each he gave according to what was suitable for him. Then he went on his journey”.
MAT.25.16	“The one who received five coins of gold went and gained five others”.
MAT.25.17	“Likewise the one who received two, went and gained two others”.
MAT.25.18	“But he who received the one went, dug in the earth, and hid the money of his Adon 
MAT.25.19	“After many days the Adon 
MAT.25.20	“The one who received five coins of gold came near and said to him: My Adon 
MAT.25.21	“His Adon 
MAT.25.22	“Also the one who received two coins of gold drew near and said: ‘My Adon 
MAT.25.23	“His Adon 
MAT.25.24	“Then he who had received the one drew near and said: ‘My Adon 
MAT.25.25	‘So in fear of you I went and hid your coin of gold and behold you have what is yours’”.
MAT.25.26	“His Adon 
MAT.25.27	‘therefore, you should have given my wealth to my money-changers so that at my coming I would have received what is mine with profit’”.
MAT.25.28	“Therefore, take from him the coin of gold and give it to the one who gained five coins of gold”.
MAT.25.29	“To the one who has it will be given, but to the one who does not have that which was intended for him will be taken from him”.
MAT.25.30	“As for the lazy slave, cast him into the darkness of the lowest places, in that place shall be for him weeping and gnashing of teeth”.
MAT.25.31	Again Yeshua 
MAT.25.32	“All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate them as the shepherd separates the sheep and the goats”.
MAT.25.33	“He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left”.
MAT.25.34	“Then he will say to those on his right: ‘Enter Blessed 
MAT.25.35	“Because I was hungry and you gave me to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me to drink, I was a wayfarer and you took me in”,
MAT.25.36	“naked and you clothed me, sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me”.
MAT.25.37	“Then the righteous will answer: ‘O our Adon 
MAT.25.38	‘a wayfarer and took you in, naked and clothed you’,
MAT.25.39	‘sick and visited you, in prison and came to you?’
MAT.25.40	“The King will answer and say to them: ‘Truly I say to you that every time you did it to one of the needy of these my brethren, even the little ones like these, you did it to me’”.
MAT.25.41	“Also he will say to those on his left: ‘Depart from me you cursed, and go into the everlasting fire, to the place prepared for you, with Satan 
MAT.25.42	“because I was hungry and you did not give me to eat, I was thirsty and you did not give me to drink”,
MAT.25.43	“I was a wayfarer and you did not take me in, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me”.
MAT.25.44	“Then they also will answer and say to him: ‘When did we see you O our Adon 
MAT.25.45	“He will answer them and say: ‘I say to you whenever you did not do this to one of these needy; even the little ones like these; you did not do it to me’”.
MAT.25.46	“Then these will go into everlasting abhorrence but the righteous into everlasting life”.
MAT.26.1	It came to pass when Yeshua 
MAT.26.2	“Do you not know that after two days will be the Pesakh 
MAT.26.3	Then the rulers of the priests and the great ones of the people were gathered together in the court of the chief priest whose name was Kayafa 
MAT.26.4	They took counsel together to seize Yeshua 
MAT.26.5	But they said it should not be at the feast lest there be a tumult among the people.
MAT.26.6	It came to pass when Yeshua 
MAT.26.7	a woman drew near to him with a flask of costly ointment; she poured it upon his head while he was reclining at table.
MAT.26.8	But they said that this waste was very displeasing to them.
MAT.26.9	‘It would have been possible to have sold it for a great price and to have given it to the poor’.
MAT.26.10	Yeshua 
MAT.26.11	“Because the poor will be with you always, but I will not be with you always”.
MAT.26.12	“Her placing this on my body refers to my burial”.
MAT.26.13	“Truly I say to you, everywhere this good news is proclaimed in all the world, that which she has done will be told in reference to my memory”.
MAT.26.14	Then one of the Twelve, whose name was Y’hudah 
MAT.26.15	He said: ‘What will you give me that I should deliver Yeshua 
MAT.26.16	From then on he sought a context for delivering him over.
MAT.26.17	On the first day of the festival of unleavened bread the disciples came to Yeshua 
MAT.26.18	He said to them: “Go into the city to a certain man who will be a volunteer for the task and say to him: ‘Thus says the Teacher 
MAT.26.19	The disciples did as Yeshua 
MAT.26.20	It came to pass at the time of evening, he was sitting at table with his twelve disciples.
MAT.26.21	As they were eating he said to them: “I say to you that one of you will inform against me”.
MAT.26.22	They were very sad and spoke each one to him saying: ‘Adon 
MAT.26.23	He answered them: “He who dips his hand with me in the dish, will sell me”. All of them were eating from one dish. Therefore, they did not recognize him; because if they had recognized him they would have destroyed him.
MAT.26.24	Yeshua 
MAT.26.25	Y’hudah 
MAT.26.26	They were eating and Yeshua 
MAT.26.27	He took the cup, gave praise to his Father, gave it to them, and said: “Drink from this, all of you”.
MAT.26.28	“This is my blood of the new covenant which will be poured out for many for the atonement of sins”
MAT.26.29	“I say to you, I will not drink from this time forth 
MAT.26.30	And they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.
MAT.26.31	Then Yeshua 
MAT.26.32	“After my resurrection from death, I will be revealed to you in Galil 
MAT.26.33	Kefa 
MAT.26.34	Yeshua 
MAT.26.35	Kefa 
MAT.26.36	Then Yeshua 
MAT.26.37	He took Kefa 
MAT.26.38	Then he said to them: “My soul is grieved unto death; support me and watch with me”.
MAT.26.39	He slowly went forward a little, fell on his face, prayed and said: “My Father, if it is possible, take this cup from me. Indeed let it not be as I will, but according to Your will”.
MAT.26.40	He came to his disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Kefa 
MAT.26.41	“Watch and pray lest you enter into temptation, because truly the Spirit 
MAT.26.42	He went again to pray saying: “My Father if You are not able to remove this cup except I should drink it, let it be done according to Your will”.
MAT.26.43	Afterwards he returned and found them sleeping because their eyes were heavy.
MAT.26.44	He left them and went to pray a third time according to the first words.
MAT.26.45	Then Yeshua 
MAT.26.46	“Arise, let us go, for look! he who will betray me is near”.
MAT.26.47	While he was speaking, behold Y’hudah 
MAT.26.48	He who betrayed him had given them a sign: ‘The man whom I kiss is the one whom you are to arrest’.
MAT.26.49	Immediately he drew near to Yeshua 
MAT.26.50	Yeshua 
MAT.26.51	Behold, one who was with Yeshua 
MAT.26.52	Yeshua 
MAT.26.53	“Do you not understand that I can appeal to my Father and indeed there would be for me at once more than twelve legions of angels”.
MAT.26.54	“But how will the Scripture be fulfilled? Because thus it is intended to be done”.
MAT.26.55	Afterwards Yeshua 
MAT.26.56	“Surely all this was done because the writings of the Prophets were being fulfilled”. Then all his disciples left him and fled.
MAT.26.57	They led Yeshua 
MAT.26.58	Kefa 
MAT.26.59	The chief priests and the P’rushim 
MAT.26.60	But they did not find even one, though they provided many false witnesses against Yeshua 
MAT.26.61	They said: ‘This one said I have the power to destroy the temple of The Most High and after three days to repair it’.
MAT.26.62	The high priest arose and said to him: ‘Do you not answer anything against the testimony that these are bearing against you?’
MAT.26.63	But Yeshua 
MAT.26.64	Yeshua 
MAT.26.65	Then the high priest tore his garments and said: ‘This one has cursed Elohim 
MAT.26.66	‘What do you think can be done?’ They answered: ‘He is guilty of death’.
MAT.26.67	Then they spat on his face and struck him on the back, and others slapped him in the face
MAT.26.68	saying: ‘Tell us Moshiach 
MAT.26.69	Kefa 
MAT.26.70	Kefa 
MAT.26.71	When he passed through the gate another maid saw him and said to those who were standing there: ‘This man also was with Yeshua 
MAT.26.72	Again he denied Yeshua 
MAT.26.73	After a little while, those who were standing in the courtyard drew near to Kefa 
MAT.26.74	Then he began to deny and to swear that at no time had he known him. Immediately the cock crowed.
MAT.26.75	Kefa 
MAT.27.1	It came to pass in the morning all the chief priests and elders took counsel against Yeshua 
MAT.27.2	They led him bound to the house of Pontius Pilate 
MAT.27.3	When Y’hudah 
MAT.27.4	He said: ‘I have sinned because I have shed innocent blood’. But they said to him: ‘What is that to us? You see to it’.
MAT.27.5	He threw the coins into the temple, went and took a rope and hanged himself.
MAT.27.6	When the chief priests received the coins they said: ‘It is not possible for us to place these coins in the temple because they are the fruit of blood since they were given for the blood of Yeshua 
MAT.27.7	So they took counsel and gave them for a field of a certain potter of clay, that they might bury strangers there.
MAT.27.8	Therefore that field is called the tent of blood unto this day.
MAT.27.9	Then was fulfilled the word of Zechariah the prophet: “And I said to them: ‘If it is good in your eyes, make out my wages, but if not, refrain 
MAT.27.10	And they gave them for the potter’s field as Yehovah 
MAT.27.11	Yeshua 
MAT.27.12	When Yeshua 
MAT.27.13	Pilate 
MAT.27.14	But Yeshua 
MAT.27.15	On the day of the honored feast of Pesakh 
MAT.27.16	Pilate 
MAT.27.17	When they were gathered together Pilate 
MAT.27.18	This was because Pilate 
MAT.27.19	While he was sitting on the throne, his wife sent to him a messenger, saying: ‘I implore you that in no matter should you speak a word against this righteous man because in this night I have suffered many things in a vision because of Him.’
MAT.27.20	The chief priests and the elders of the law assembled the people that they might ask for Bar-Abba 
MAT.27.21	Pilate 
MAT.27.22	Pilate 
MAT.27.23	Pilate 
MAT.27.24	Pilate 
MAT.27.25	All the people answered and said: ‘His blood will be upon us and upon our seed’
MAT.27.26	Then he released Bar-Abba 
MAT.27.27	Then the horsemen of the court took Yeshua 
MAT.27.28	They clothed Yeshua 
MAT.27.29	The made a crown of thorns, and placed it on His head, and set a reed in his right hand and were bowing down mocking him: ‘Shalom be upon you King of the Yehudim 
MAT.27.30	They spat in His face, and took the reed and struck his head.
MAT.27.31	When they had deceived Him much, they stripped the robe from him, dressed him in his own clothes, and gave orders to crucify Him.
MAT.27.32	As they were going out from the city, they met a man whose name was Shim’on 
MAT.27.33	They came to a place called Gulgolta,
MAT.27.34	and gave Him wine mixed with gall 
MAT.27.35	When they placed him on the beam they divided his garments by lot.
MAT.27.37	Afterward they set above His head a writing which said: “THIS IS YESHUA 
MAT.27.38	Then two robbers were crucified with Him, one on his right and one on his left.
MAT.27.39	Those who were passing by deceived him and shook their heads
MAT.27.40	saying, ‘See, how you would lay waste the temple of The Mighty One and yet rebuild it in three days, save yourself. If you are the Son of The Mighty One, come down from the beam.’
MAT.27.41	The chief priests and the elders of the people deceived him saying:
MAT.27.42	‘He saved others; he cannot save Himself. If he is the King of Y’sra’el 
MAT.27.43	‘Since he trusted in The Mighty One; let Him save him now if He wishes, because he said, he is the Son of The Mighty One’.
MAT.27.44	The robbers who had been crucified with Him said to him these very same words.
MAT.27.45	At the sixth hour, darkness came in all the world and it remained until the ninth hour.
MAT.27.46	Yeshua 
MAT.27.47	One of those standing there said: ‘This one is calling for Eliyahu 
MAT.27.48	Immediately he took spongy-bread, filled it with vinegar and gave it to him to drink.
MAT.27.49	Others were saying ‘We will see if Eliyahu 
MAT.27.50	Yeshua 
MAT.27.51	Immediately the curtain of the temple was torn into two pieces from the top downward; the earth shook and the rocks were broken.
MAT.27.52	The graves were opened and many of those asleep in the dust arose.
MAT.27.53	They came out of their graves and after the resurrection they entered the holy city and were revealed to many.
MAT.27.54	The captain of the hundred and those who were with him watching Yeshua 
MAT.27.55	Many women from among those who served Yeshua 
MAT.27.56	Among them were Miryam 
MAT.27.57	At evening time, a rich man from Ramatayim 
MAT.27.58	He came to Pilate 
MAT.27.59	Yosef 
MAT.27.60	He placed him in his own tomb, which had been freshly cut from stone and placed a large stone over the entrance of the tomb.
MAT.27.61	And Miryam 
MAT.27.62	On the morning of the Pesakh 
MAT.27.63	They said to him: ‘Sir, we remember that this liar said while still alive that at the end of three days he would come to life and arise’.
MAT.27.64	‘Therefore, command his tomb to be guarded until the third day, since perhaps one of his disciples might come and steal him. Afterwards they might say to the people that he arose from death. If they should do this the last perversion will be greater than the first.’
MAT.27.65	Pilate 
MAT.27.66	So they completed the structure of the tomb, sealed it and placed a guard there.
MAT.28.1	On the first day of the week, early in the morning, Miryam 
MAT.28.2	Then the earth shook because an angel of Yehovah 
MAT.28.3	His appearance was like the sun, and his garments like snow.
MAT.28.4	From the fear of him the guards were dismayed and stood like dead men.
MAT.28.5	The angel answered and said to the women: “Do not be afraid; for I know that you seek Yeshua 
MAT.28.6	“He is not here, for He is already alive, as He said. Come, therefore, and see the place where the Adon 
MAT.28.7	“Then go immediately and tell His disciples that the Adon 
MAT.28.8	The women went out of the tomb with fear because they had seen the angel, but with great joy because the Adon 
MAT.28.9	As they were going, Yeshua 
MAT.28.10	Then Yeshua 
MAT.28.11	While they were going, some of the guards entered the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened.
MAT.28.12	They came together for counsel with the elders of the people. Then they gave much money to the horsemen,
MAT.28.13	and said to them: ‘Say that his disciples came by night and stole Him while you were sleeping’.
MAT.28.14	‘If this should come to the ears of Pilate 
MAT.28.15	They took the money and said thus as they had been instructed. This is the word in secret among the Yehudim 
MAT.28.16	After this when his twelve disciples came to Galil 
MAT.28.17	When they saw Him, they did homage to him; but there were some of them who doubted him.
MAT.28.18	Yeshua 
MAT.28.19	“Go and make disciples, of all the nations, to believe in my name”
MAT.28.20	“and teach them to observe all the words which I have commanded you, forever”.
MRK.1.1	The beginning of the Gospel 
MRK.1.2	As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before your
MRK.1.3	The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you
MRK.1.4	Yochanan 
MRK.1.5	And there went out unto him all the land of Y’hudah 
MRK.1.6	And Yochanan 
MRK.1.7	And preached, saying, There comes one mightier than I after me, the sandal lace of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.
MRK.1.8	I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit 
MRK.1.9	And it came to pass in those days, that Yeshua 
MRK.1.10	And immediately coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit 
MRK.1.11	And there came a voice from heaven, 
MRK.1.12	And immediately the Spirit 
MRK.1.13	And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tried or tested of Satan 
MRK.1.14	Now after that Yochanan 
MRK.1.15	And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God-Theos is at hand: repent you
MRK.1.16	Now as he walked by the sea of Galil 
MRK.1.17	And Yeshua 
MRK.1.18	And immediately they forsook their nets, and followed him.
MRK.1.19	And when he had gone a little further there, he saw Ya’akov 
MRK.1.20	And immediately he called them: and they left their father Zavdai 
MRK.1.21	And they went into K’far-Nachum 
MRK.1.22	And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the Torah-teachers 
MRK.1.23	And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean Spirit 
MRK.1.24	Saying, Let 
MRK.1.25	And Yeshua 
MRK.1.26	And when the unclean Spirit 
MRK.1.27	And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine 
MRK.1.28	And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galil 
MRK.1.29	And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Shim’on 
MRK.1.30	But Shim’on 
MRK.1.31	And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.
MRK.1.32	And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with demons.
MRK.1.33	And all the city was gathered together at the door.
MRK.1.34	And he healed many that were sick of different diseases, and cast out many demons; and did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.
MRK.1.35	And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.
MRK.1.36	And Shim’on 
MRK.1.37	And when they had found him, they said unto him, All 
MRK.1.38	And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.
MRK.1.39	And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galil 
MRK.1.40	And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If you
MRK.1.41	And Yeshua 
MRK.1.42	And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.
MRK.1.43	And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;
MRK.1.44	And says unto him, See you
MRK.1.45	But he went out, and began to publish 
MRK.2.1	And again he entered into K’far-Nachum 
MRK.2.2	And immediately many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive 
MRK.2.3	And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.
MRK.2.4	And when they could not come near unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken 
MRK.2.5	When Yeshua 
MRK.2.6	But there were certain of the Torah-teachers 
MRK.2.7	Why does this 
MRK.2.8	And immediately when Yeshua 
MRK.2.9	Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, [You
MRK.2.10	But that you
MRK.2.11	I say unto you
MRK.2.12	And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God-Theos, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.
MRK.2.13	And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.
MRK.2.14	And as he passed by, he saw Levi 
MRK.2.15	And it came to pass, that, as Yeshua 
MRK.2.16	And when the Torah-teachers 
MRK.2.17	When Yeshua 
MRK.2.18	And the disciples of Yochanan 
MRK.2.19	And Yeshua 
MRK.2.20	But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.
MRK.2.21	No man also sews a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up takes away from the old, and the rent is made worse.
MRK.2.22	And no man puts New Wine into old bottles: else the New Wine does burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but New Wine must be put into new bottles.
MRK.2.23	And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the Shabbat 
MRK.2.24	And the P’rushim 
MRK.2.25	And he said unto them, Have you
MRK.2.26	How he went into the house of God-Theos in the days of Avyatar 
MRK.2.27	And he said unto them, The Shabbat 
MRK.2.28	Therefore the Son of Man is Lord - Kurios also of the Shabbat 
MRK.3.1	And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.
MRK.3.2	And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the Shabbat 
MRK.3.3	And he says unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.
MRK.3.4	And he says unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the Shabbat 
MRK.3.5	And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the blindness of their hearts, he says unto the man, Stretch forth your
MRK.3.6	And the P’rushim 
MRK.3.7	But Yeshua 
MRK.3.8	And from Yerushalayim 
MRK.3.9	And he spoke to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.
MRK.3.10	For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.
MRK.3.11	And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, you
MRK.3.12	And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.
MRK.3.13	And he goes up into a mountain, and calls 
MRK.3.14	And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,
MRK.3.15	And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out demons:
MRK.3.16	And Shim’on 
MRK.3.17	And Ya’akov 
MRK.3.18	And Andrew 
MRK.3.19	And Y’hudah 
MRK.3.20	And the multitude comes together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
MRK.3.21	And when his friends heard 
MRK.3.22	And the Torah-teachers 
MRK.3.23	And he called them 
MRK.3.24	And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
MRK.3.25	And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
MRK.3.26	And if Satan 
MRK.3.27	No man can enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil 
MRK.3.28	Truly I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies which soever they shall blaspheme:
MRK.3.29	But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit 
MRK.3.30	Because they said, He has an unclean Spirit 
MRK.3.31	There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.
MRK.3.32	And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, you
MRK.3.33	And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?
MRK.3.34	And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!
MRK.3.35	For whosoever shall do the will of God-Theos, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.
MRK.4.1	And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.
MRK.4.2	And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,
MRK.4.3	Listen; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:
MRK.4.4	And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.
MRK.4.5	And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:
MRK.4.6	But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.
MRK.4.7	And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
MRK.4.8	And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.
MRK.4.9	And he said unto them, He that has ears to hear, let him hear.
MRK.4.10	And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.
MRK.4.11	And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God-Theos: but unto them that are without, all 
MRK.4.12	That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and 
MRK.4.13	And he said unto them, Know you
MRK.4.14	The sower sows the word.
MRK.4.15	And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan 
MRK.4.16	And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;
MRK.4.17	And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution arises for the word’s sake, immediately they are offended.
MRK.4.18	And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,
MRK.4.19	And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
MRK.4.20	And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive 
MRK.4.21	And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?
MRK.4.22	For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.
MRK.4.23	If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
MRK.4.24	And he said unto them, Take heed what you
MRK.4.25	For he that has, to him shall be given: and he that has not, from him shall be taken even that which he has.
MRK.4.26	And he said, So is the kingdom of God-Theos, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;
MRK.4.27	And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knows not how.
MRK.4.28	For the earth brings forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.
MRK.4.29	But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest is come.
MRK.4.30	And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God-Theos? or with what comparison shall we compare it?
MRK.4.32	But when it is sown, it grows up, and becomes greater than all herbs, and shoots out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.
MRK.4.33	And with many such parables spoke he the word unto them, as they were able to hear 
MRK.4.34	But without a parable spoke he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.
MRK.4.35	And the same day, when the even was come, he says unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.
MRK.4.36	And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.
MRK.4.37	And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.
MRK.4.38	And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, care you
MRK.4.39	And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
MRK.4.40	And he said unto them, Why are you
MRK.4.41	And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
MRK.5.1	And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes’ 
MRK.5.2	And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean Spirit 
MRK.5.3	Who had 
MRK.5.4	Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any 
MRK.5.5	And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.
MRK.5.6	But when he saw Yeshua 
MRK.5.7	And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with you
MRK.5.8	For he said unto him, Come out of the man, 
MRK.5.9	And he asked him, What 
MRK.5.10	And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
MRK.5.11	Now there was there near unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.
MRK.5.12	And all the demons besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.
MRK.5.13	And forthwith Yeshua 
MRK.5.14	And they that fed the swine fled, and told 
MRK.5.15	And they come to Yeshua 
MRK.5.16	And they that saw 
MRK.5.17	And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.
MRK.5.18	And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.
MRK.5.19	However Yeshua 
MRK.5.20	And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis 
MRK.5.21	And when Yeshua 
MRK.5.22	And, behold, there comes one of the rulers of the synagogue, Ya’ir 
MRK.5.23	And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lies at the point of death: [I pray you
MRK.5.24	And 
MRK.5.25	And a certain woman, which had an issue 
MRK.5.26	And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,
MRK.5.27	When she had heard of Yeshua 
MRK.5.28	For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.
MRK.5.29	And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in 
MRK.5.30	And Yeshua 
MRK.5.31	And his disciples said unto him, you
MRK.5.32	And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.
MRK.5.33	But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.
MRK.5.34	And he said unto her, Daughter, your
MRK.5.35	While he yet spoke, there came from the ruler of the synagogue’s 
MRK.5.36	As soon as Yeshua 
MRK.5.37	And he suffered no man to follow him, save Kefa 
MRK.5.38	And he comes to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and sees the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.
MRK.5.39	And when he was come in, he says unto them, Why make you
MRK.5.40	And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he takes the father and the mother of the girl, and them that were with him, and enters in where the girl was lying.
MRK.5.41	And he took the girl by the hand, and said unto her, Talita, kumi!; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto you
MRK.5.42	And immediately the girl arose, and walked; for she was 
MRK.5.43	And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.
MRK.6.1	And he went out from there, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.
MRK.6.2	And when the Shabbat 
MRK.6.3	Is not this the carpenter, the son of Miryam 
MRK.6.4	But Yeshua 
MRK.6.5	And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed 
MRK.6.6	And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.
MRK.6.7	And he called 
MRK.6.8	And commanded them that they should take nothing for 
MRK.6.9	But 
MRK.6.10	And he said unto them, In what place soever you
MRK.6.11	And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when you
MRK.6.12	And they went out, and preached that men should repent.
MRK.6.13	And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed 
MRK.6.14	And king Herod 
MRK.6.15	Others said, That it is Eliyahu 
MRK.6.16	But when Herod 
MRK.6.17	For Herod 
MRK.6.18	For Yochanan 
MRK.6.19	Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:
MRK.6.20	For Herod 
MRK.6.21	And when a convenient 
MRK.6.22	And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod 
MRK.6.23	And he swore unto her, Whatsoever you
MRK.6.24	And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of Yochanan 
MRK.6.25	And she came in immediately with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that you
MRK.6.26	And the king was exceeding sorry; 
MRK.6.27	And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,
MRK.6.28	And brought his head in a charger 
MRK.6.29	And when his disciples heard 
MRK.6.30	And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Yeshua 
MRK.6.31	And he said unto them, Come you
MRK.6.32	And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.
MRK.6.33	And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot there out of all cities, and outwent 
MRK.6.34	And Yeshua 
MRK.6.35	And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time 
MRK.6.36	Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.
MRK.6.37	He answered and said unto them, Give you
MRK.6.38	He says unto them, How many loaves have you
MRK.6.39	And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.
MRK.6.40	And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.
MRK.6.41	And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and Blessed 
MRK.6.42	And they did all eat, and were filled.
MRK.6.43	And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.
MRK.6.44	And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.
MRK.6.45	And immediately he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Beit-Tzaidah 
MRK.6.46	And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.
MRK.6.47	And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.
MRK.6.48	And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he comes unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.
MRK.6.49	But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a Spirit 
MRK.6.50	For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and says unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.
MRK.6.51	And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.
MRK.6.52	For they considered not 
MRK.6.53	And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Kinneret 
MRK.6.54	And when they were come out of the ship, immediately they knew him,
MRK.6.55	And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.
MRK.6.56	And to wherever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.
MRK.7.1	Then came together unto him the P’rushim (Pharisee 
MRK.7.2	And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.
MRK.7.3	For the P’rushim (Pharisee 
MRK.7.4	And 
MRK.7.5	Then the P’rushim 
MRK.7.6	He answered and said unto them, Well has Yesha’yahu 
MRK.7.7	However in vain do they worship me, teaching 
MRK.7.8	For laying aside the commandment of God-Theos, you
MRK.7.9	And he said unto them, Full well you
MRK.7.10	For Moshe 
MRK.7.11	But you
MRK.7.12	And you
MRK.7.13	Making the word of God-Theos of none effect through your tradition, which you
MRK.7.14	And when he had called all the people 
MRK.7.15	There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.
MRK.7.16	If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
MRK.7.17	And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.
MRK.7.18	And he says unto them, Are you
MRK.7.19	Because it enters not into his heart, but into the belly, and goes out into the draught, purging all meats?
MRK.7.20	And he said, That which comes out of the man, that defiles the man.
MRK.7.21	For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,
MRK.7.22	Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness (being lustful, loose or lewd; promoting lustful desires in others), an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:
MRK.7.23	All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.
MRK.7.24	And from there he arose, and went into the borders of Tzor 
MRK.7.25	For a 
MRK.7.26	The woman was a Greek [unstable: the miry one], a Syro-phoenician [Syria (meaning disputed, blood red)] by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.
MRK.7.27	But Yeshua 
MRK.7.28	And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord - Kurios: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.
MRK.7.29	And he said unto her, For this saying go your
MRK.7.30	And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.
MRK.7.31	And again, departing from the coasts of Tzor 
MRK.7.32	And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech 
MRK.7.33	And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;
MRK.7.34	And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and says unto him, Hippatach!, that is, Be opened.
MRK.7.35	And immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plain.
MRK.7.36	And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published 
MRK.7.37	And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He has done all things well: he makes both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
MRK.8.1	In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Yeshua 
MRK.8.2	I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:
MRK.8.3	And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will give up by the way: for different of them came from far.
MRK.8.4	And his disciples answered him, From what place can a man satisfy these 
MRK.8.5	And he asked them, How many loaves have you
MRK.8.6	And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and broke, and gave to his disciples to set before 
MRK.8.7	And they had a few small fishes: and he Blessed 
MRK.8.8	So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken 
MRK.8.9	And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.
MRK.8.10	And immediately he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanuta 
MRK.8.11	And the P’rushim 
MRK.8.12	And he sighed deeply in his Spirit 
MRK.8.13	And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.
MRK.8.14	Now 
MRK.8.15	And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the P’rushim (Pharisee 
MRK.8.16	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, 
MRK.8.17	And when Yeshua 
MRK.8.18	Having eyes, see you
MRK.8.19	When I broke the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took you
MRK.8.20	And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took you
MRK.8.21	And he said unto them, How is it that you
MRK.8.22	And he comes to Beit-Tzaidah 
MRK.8.23	And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.
MRK.8.24	And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.
MRK.8.25	After that he put 
MRK.8.26	And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell 
MRK.8.27	And Yeshua 
MRK.8.28	And they answered, Yochanan 
MRK.8.29	And he says unto them, But whom say you
MRK.8.30	And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
MRK.8.31	And he began to teach them, that the Son of Man must suffer 
MRK.8.32	And he spoke that saying openly. And Kefa 
MRK.8.33	But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Kefa 
MRK.8.34	And when he had called the people 
MRK.8.35	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the Gospel 
MRK.8.36	For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
MRK.8.37	Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
MRK.8.38	Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.
MRK.9.1	And he said unto them, Truly I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God-Theos come with power.
MRK.9.2	And after six days Yeshua 
MRK.9.3	And his clothing became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller (washer and/or bleacher of clothes) on earth can white them.
MRK.9.4	And there appeared unto them Eliyahu 
MRK.9.5	And Kefa 
MRK.9.6	For he did not know not what to say; for they were sore afraid.
MRK.9.7	And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.
MRK.9.8	And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Yeshua 
MRK.9.9	And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of Man were risen from the dead.
MRK.9.10	And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.
MRK.9.11	And they asked him, saying, Why say the Torah-teachers 
MRK.9.12	And he answered and told them, Eliyahu 
MRK.9.13	But I say unto you, That Eliyahu 
MRK.9.14	And when he came to 
MRK.9.15	And immediately all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to 
MRK.9.16	And he asked the Torah-teachers 
MRK.9.17	And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto you
MRK.9.18	And wherever he takes him, he tears him: and he foams, and gnashes with his teeth, and pines away: and I spoke to your
MRK.9.19	He answer him, and says, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer 
MRK.9.20	And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, immediately the Spirit 
MRK.9.21	And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child.
MRK.9.22	And ofttimes it has cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if you
MRK.9.23	Yeshua 
MRK.9.24	And immediately the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord - Kurios, I believe; help you
MRK.9.25	When Yeshua 
MRK.9.26	And [the Spirit 
MRK.9.27	But Yeshua 
MRK.9.28	And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?
MRK.9.29	And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.
MRK.9.30	And they departed there, and passed through Galil 
MRK.9.31	For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of Man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.
MRK.9.32	But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.
MRK.9.33	And he came to K’far-Nachum 
MRK.9.34	But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who 
MRK.9.35	And he sat down, and called the twelve, and says unto them, If any man desire to be first, 
MRK.9.36	And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,
MRK.9.37	Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receives me: and whosoever shall receive me, receives not me, but him that sent me.
MRK.9.38	And Yochanan 
MRK.9.39	But Yeshua 
MRK.9.40	For he that is not against us is on our part.
MRK.9.41	For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you
MRK.9.42	And whosoever shall offend 
MRK.9.43	And if your
MRK.9.44	Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.
MRK.9.45	And if your
MRK.9.46	Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.
MRK.9.47	And if your
MRK.9.48	Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.
MRK.9.49	For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.
MRK.9.50	Salt 
MRK.10.1	And he arose from there, and comes into the coasts of Y’hudah 
MRK.10.2	And the P’rushim 
MRK.10.3	And he answered and said unto them, What did Moshe 
MRK.10.4	And they said, Moshe 
MRK.10.5	And Yeshua 
MRK.10.6	But from the beginning of the creation God-Theos made them male and female.
MRK.10.7	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave 
MRK.10.8	And they two shall be one flesh: so then they are no more two, but one flesh.
MRK.10.9	What therefore God-Theos has joined together, let not man put asunder.
MRK.10.10	And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same 
MRK.10.11	And he says unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, commit adultery against her.
MRK.10.12	And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she commit adultery.
MRK.10.13	And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and 
MRK.10.14	But when Yeshua 
MRK.10.15	Truly I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God-Theos as a little child, he shall not enter in it.
MRK.10.16	And he took them up in his arms, put 
MRK.10.17	And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
MRK.10.18	And Yeshua 
MRK.10.19	you
MRK.10.20	And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.
MRK.10.21	Then Yeshua 
MRK.10.22	And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.
MRK.10.23	And Yeshua 
MRK.10.24	And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Yeshua 
MRK.10.25	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God-Theos.
MRK.10.26	And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?
MRK.10.27	And Yeshua 
MRK.10.28	Then Kefa 
MRK.10.29	And Yeshua 
MRK.10.30	But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.
MRK.10.31	But many 
MRK.10.32	And they were in the way going up to Yerushalayim 
MRK.10.34	And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.
MRK.10.35	And Ya’akov 
MRK.10.36	And he said unto them, What would you
MRK.10.37	They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on your
MRK.10.38	But Yeshua 
MRK.10.39	And they said unto him, We can. And Yeshua 
MRK.10.40	But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not my to give; but 
MRK.10.41	And when the ten heard 
MRK.10.42	But Yeshua 
MRK.10.43	But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:
MRK.10.44	And whosoever of you will be the most important, shall be slave of all.
MRK.10.45	For even the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
MRK.10.46	And they came to Yericho 
MRK.10.47	And when he heard that it was Yeshua 
MRK.10.48	And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, 
MRK.10.49	And Yeshua 
MRK.10.50	And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Yeshua 
MRK.10.51	And Yeshua 
MRK.10.52	And Yeshua 
MRK.11.1	And when they came near to Yerushalayim 
MRK.11.2	And says unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as you
MRK.11.3	And if any man say unto you, Why do you
MRK.11.4	And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.
MRK.11.5	And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do you
MRK.11.6	And they said unto them even as Yeshua 
MRK.11.7	And they brought the colt to Yeshua 
MRK.11.8	And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and scattered 
MRK.11.9	And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed 
MRK.11.10	Blessed 
MRK.11.11	And Yeshua 
MRK.11.12	And on the morrow, when they were come from Beit-Anyah 
MRK.11.13	And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if perhaps 
MRK.11.14	And Yeshua 
MRK.11.15	And they come to Yerushalayim 
MRK.11.16	And would not suffer 
MRK.11.17	And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but you
MRK.11.18	And the Torah-teachers 
MRK.11.19	And when even was come, he went out of the city.
MRK.11.20	And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.
MRK.11.21	And Kefa 
MRK.11.22	And Yeshua 
MRK.11.23	For truly I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be you
MRK.11.24	Therefore I say unto you, What things soever you
MRK.11.25	And when you
MRK.11.26	But if you
MRK.11.27	And they come again to Yerushalayim 
MRK.11.28	And say unto him, By what authority do you
MRK.11.29	And Yeshua 
MRK.11.30	The baptism of Yochanan 
MRK.11.31	And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did you
MRK.11.32	But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all 
MRK.11.33	And they answered and said unto Yeshua 
MRK.12.1	And he began to speak unto them by parables. A 
MRK.12.2	And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a slave, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.
MRK.12.3	And they caught 
MRK.12.4	And again he sent unto them another slave; and at him they cast stones, and wounded 
MRK.12.5	And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.
MRK.12.6	Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.
MRK.12.7	But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.
MRK.12.8	And they took him, and killed 
MRK.12.9	What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.
MRK.12.10	And have you
MRK.12.11	This was the Lord - Kurios’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?
MRK.12.12	And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.
MRK.12.13	And they send unto him certain of the P’rushim 
MRK.12.14	And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that you
MRK.12.15	Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt you
MRK.12.16	And they brought 
MRK.12.17	And Yeshua 
MRK.12.18	Then come unto him the Tz’dukim 
MRK.12.19	Master, Moshe 
MRK.12.20	Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.
MRK.12.21	And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.
MRK.12.22	And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.
MRK.12.23	In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.
MRK.12.24	And Yeshua 
MRK.12.25	For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.
MRK.12.26	And as touching the dead, that they rise: have you
MRK.12.27	He is not the God-Theos of the dead, but the God-Theos of the living: you
MRK.12.28	And one of the Torah-teachers 
MRK.12.29	And Yeshua 
MRK.12.30	And you
MRK.12.31	And the second 
MRK.12.32	And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, you
MRK.12.33	And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love 
MRK.12.34	And when Yeshua 
MRK.12.35	And Yeshua 
MRK.12.36	For David 
MRK.12.37	David 
MRK.12.38	And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the Torah-teachers 
MRK.12.39	And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:
MRK.12.40	Which devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.
MRK.12.41	And Yeshua 
MRK.12.42	And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.
MRK.12.43	And he called 
MRK.12.44	For all 
MRK.13.1	And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples says unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings 
MRK.13.2	And Yeshua 
MRK.13.3	And as he sat upon the Mount of Olives over against the temple, Kefa 
MRK.13.4	Tell us, when shall these things be? and what 
MRK.13.5	And Yeshua 
MRK.13.6	For many shall come in my name, saying, I am [Moshiach 
MRK.13.7	And when you
MRK.13.8	For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in different places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these 
MRK.13.9	But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues you
MRK.13.10	And the Gospel 
MRK.13.11	But when they shall lead 
MRK.13.12	Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against 
MRK.13.13	And you
MRK.13.14	But when you
MRK.13.15	And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter 
MRK.13.16	And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.
MRK.13.17	But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!
MRK.13.18	And pray you
MRK.13.19	For 
MRK.13.20	And except that the Lord - Kurios had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect’s sake, whom he has chosen, he has shortened the days.
MRK.13.21	And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here 
MRK.13.22	For false Christs 
MRK.13.23	But take you
MRK.13.24	But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,
MRK.13.25	And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.
MRK.13.26	And then shall they see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
MRK.13.27	And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.
MRK.13.28	Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and puts forth leaves, you
MRK.13.29	So you
MRK.13.30	Truly I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.
MRK.13.31	Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
MRK.13.32	But of that day and 
MRK.13.33	Take you
MRK.13.35	Watch you
MRK.13.36	Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.
MRK.13.37	And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.
MRK.14.1	After two days was 
MRK.14.2	But they said, Not on the feast 
MRK.14.3	And being in Beit-Anyah 
MRK.14.4	And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?
MRK.14.5	For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.
MRK.14.6	And Yeshua 
MRK.14.7	For you
MRK.14.8	She has done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.
MRK.14.9	Truly I say unto you, Wheresoever this Gospel 
MRK.14.10	And Y’hudah 
MRK.14.11	And when they heard 
MRK.14.12	And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the Passover, his disciples said unto him, Where will you
MRK.14.13	And he send forth two of his disciples, and says unto them, Go you
MRK.14.14	And wherever he shall go in, say you
MRK.14.15	And he will show you a large upper room furnished 
MRK.14.16	And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the Passover.
MRK.14.17	And in the evening he comes with the twelve.
MRK.14.18	And as they sat and did eat, Yeshua 
MRK.14.19	And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, 
MRK.14.20	And he answered and said unto them, 
MRK.14.21	The Son of Man indeed goes, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.
MRK.14.22	And as they did eat, Yeshua 
MRK.14.23	And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave 
MRK.14.24	And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament 
MRK.14.25	Truly I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God-Theos.
MRK.14.26	And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the Mount of Olives.
MRK.14.27	And Yeshua 
MRK.14.28	But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galil 
MRK.14.29	But Kefa 
MRK.14.30	And Yeshua 
MRK.14.31	But he spoke the more vehemently, If I should die with you
MRK.14.32	And they came to a place which was named Gat-Sh’manim 
MRK.14.33	And he takes with him Kefa 
MRK.14.34	And says unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: wait you
MRK.14.35	And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
MRK.14.36	And he said, Abba, Father, all things 
MRK.14.37	And he comes, and finds them sleeping, and says unto Kefa 
MRK.14.38	Watch you
MRK.14.39	And again he went away, and prayed, and spoke the same words.
MRK.14.40	And when he returned, he found them asleep again, 
MRK.14.41	And he comes the third time, and says unto them, Sleep on now, and take 
MRK.14.42	Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrays me is at hand.
MRK.14.43	And immediately, while he yet spoke, comes Y’hudah 
MRK.14.44	And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead 
MRK.14.45	And as soon as he was come, he goes immediately to him, and says, Master, master; and kissed him.
MRK.14.46	And they laid their hands on him, and took him.
MRK.14.47	And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and struck a slave of the High Priest, and cut off his ear.
MRK.14.48	And Yeshua 
MRK.14.49	I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you
MRK.14.50	And they all forsook him, and fled.
MRK.14.51	And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about 
MRK.14.52	And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.
MRK.14.53	And they led Yeshua 
MRK.14.54	And Kefa 
MRK.14.55	And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Yeshua 
MRK.14.56	For many bore false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.
MRK.14.57	And there arose certain, and bore false witness against him, saying,
MRK.14.58	We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.
MRK.14.59	But neither so did their witness agree together.
MRK.14.60	And the High Priest stood up in the midst, and asked Yeshua 
MRK.14.61	But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the High Priest asked him, and said unto him, Are you
MRK.14.62	And Yeshua 
MRK.14.63	Then the High Priest rent his clothes, and says, What need we any further witnesses?
MRK.14.64	You
MRK.14.65	And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet 
MRK.14.66	And as Kefa 
MRK.14.67	And when she saw Kefa 
MRK.14.68	But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what you
MRK.14.69	And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is 
MRK.14.70	And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Kefa 
MRK.14.71	But he began to curse and to swear, 
MRK.14.72	And the second time the cock crew. And Kefa 
MRK.15.1	And immediately in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and Torah-teachers 
MRK.15.2	And Pilate 
MRK.15.3	And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.
MRK.15.4	And Pilate 
MRK.15.5	But Yeshua 
MRK.15.6	Now at 
MRK.15.7	And there was 
MRK.15.8	And the multitude crying aloud began to desire 
MRK.15.9	But Pilate 
MRK.15.10	For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.
MRK.15.11	But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Bar-Abba 
MRK.15.12	And Pilate 
MRK.15.13	And they cried out again, Crucify him.
MRK.15.14	Then Pilate 
MRK.15.15	And 
MRK.15.16	And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium 
MRK.15.17	And they clothed him with purple, and braided a crown of thorns, and put it about his 
MRK.15.18	And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Y’hudim 
MRK.15.19	And they struck him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing 
MRK.15.20	And when they had deceived him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.
MRK.15.21	And they compel one Shim’on 
MRK.15.22	And they bring him unto the place Gulgolta 
MRK.15.23	And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received 
MRK.15.24	And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.
MRK.15.25	And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
MRK.15.26	And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
MRK.15.27	And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
MRK.15.28	And the scripture was fulfilled, which says, And he was numbered with the transgressors.
MRK.15.29	And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, you
MRK.15.30	Save yourself, and come down from the stake 
MRK.15.31	Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the Torah-teachers 
MRK.15.32	Let Moshiach 
MRK.15.33	And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
MRK.15.34	And at the ninth hour Yeshua 
MRK.15.35	And some of them that stood by, when they heard 
MRK.15.36	And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put 
MRK.15.37	And Yeshua 
MRK.15.38	And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.
MRK.15.39	And when the Centurion 
MRK.15.40	There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Miryam 
MRK.15.41	(Who also, when he was in Galil 
MRK.15.42	And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the Shabbat 
MRK.15.43	Yosef 
MRK.15.44	And Pilate 
MRK.15.45	And when he knew 
MRK.15.46	And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was cut out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.
MRK.15.47	And Miryam 
MRK.16.1	And when the Shabbat 
MRK.16.2	And very early in the morning the first 
MRK.16.3	And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?
MRK.16.4	And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.
MRK.16.5	And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.
MRK.16.6	And he says unto them, Be not affrighted: You
MRK.16.7	But go your way, tell his disciples and Kefa 
MRK.16.8	And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any 
MRK.16.9	Now when [Yeshua 
MRK.16.11	And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.
MRK.16.12	After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.
MRK.16.13	And they went and told 
MRK.16.14	Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and blindness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.
MRK.16.15	And he said unto them, Go you
MRK.16.16	He that believes and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believes not shall be judged.
MRK.16.17	And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues 
MRK.16.18	They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.
MRK.16.19	So then after the Lord - Kurios had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God-Theos.
MRK.16.20	And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord - Kurios working with 
LUK.1.1	Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,
LUK.1.2	Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;
LUK.1.3	It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto you
LUK.1.4	That you
LUK.1.5	There was in the days of Herod 
LUK.1.6	And they were both righteous before God-Theos, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord - Kurios blameless.
LUK.1.7	And they had no child, because that Elisheva 
LUK.1.8	And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office before God-Theos in the order of his course,
LUK.1.9	According to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord - Kurios.
LUK.1.10	And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.
LUK.1.11	And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord - Kurios standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
LUK.1.12	And when Z’kharyah 
LUK.1.13	But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Z’kharyah 
LUK.1.14	And you
LUK.1.15	For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord - Kurios, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit 
LUK.1.16	And many of the people of Yisra’el 
LUK.1.17	And he shall go before him in the Spirit 
LUK.1.18	And Z’kharyah 
LUK.1.19	And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God-Theos; and am sent to speak unto you
LUK.1.20	And, behold, you
LUK.1.21	And the people waited for Z’kharyah 
LUK.1.22	And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.
LUK.1.23	And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration 
LUK.1.24	And after those days his wife Elisheva 
LUK.1.25	Thus has the Lord - Kurios dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on 
LUK.1.26	And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God-Theos unto a city of Galil 
LUK.1.27	To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Yosef 
LUK.1.28	And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, 
LUK.1.29	And when she saw 
LUK.1.30	And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Miryam 
LUK.1.31	And, behold, you
LUK.1.32	He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord - Kurios God-Theos shall give unto him the throne of his father David 
LUK.1.33	And he shall reign over the house of Ya’akov 
LUK.1.34	Then said Miryam 
LUK.1.35	And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Spirit 
LUK.1.36	And, behold, your
LUK.1.37	For with God-Theos nothing shall be impossible.
LUK.1.38	And Miryam 
LUK.1.39	And Miryam 
LUK.1.40	And entered into the house of Z’kharyah 
LUK.1.41	And it came to pass, that, when Elisheva 
LUK.1.42	And she spoke out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed 
LUK.1.43	And from what place 
LUK.1.44	For, lo, as soon as the voice of your
LUK.1.45	And Blessed 
LUK.1.46	And Miryam 
LUK.1.47	And my Spirit 
LUK.1.48	For he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from from this time forth 
LUK.1.49	For he that is mighty has done to me great things; and holy 
LUK.1.50	And his mercy 
LUK.1.51	He has showed strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
LUK.1.52	He has put down the mighty from 
LUK.1.53	He has filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he has sent empty away.
LUK.1.54	He has helped his slave Yisra’el 
LUK.1.55	As he spoke to our fathers, to Avraham 
LUK.1.56	And Miryam 
LUK.1.57	Now Elisheva 
LUK.1.58	And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord - Kurios had showed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.
LUK.1.59	And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Z’kharyah 
LUK.1.60	And his mother answered and said, Not 
LUK.1.61	And they said unto her, There is none of your
LUK.1.62	And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.
LUK.1.63	And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is Yochanan 
LUK.1.64	And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue 
LUK.1.65	And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Y’hudah 
LUK.1.66	And all they that heard 
LUK.1.67	And his father Z’kharyah 
LUK.1.68	Blessed 
LUK.1.69	And has raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his slave David 
LUK.1.70	As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:
LUK.1.71	That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;
LUK.1.72	To finish the mercy 
LUK.1.73	The oath which he swore to our father Avraham 
LUK.1.74	That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,
LUK.1.75	In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.
LUK.1.76	And your
LUK.1.77	To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the forgiveness 
LUK.1.78	Through the tender mercy of our God-Theos; whereby the Dayspring 
LUK.1.79	To give light to them that sit in darkness and 
LUK.1.80	And the child grew, and waxed strong in Spirit 
LUK.2.1	And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar 
LUK.2.3	And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.
LUK.2.4	And Yosef 
LUK.2.5	To be taxed with Miryam 
LUK.2.6	And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.
LUK.2.7	And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes 
LUK.2.8	And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.
LUK.2.9	And, lo, the angel of the Lord - Kurios came upon them, and the glory of the Lord - Kurios shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.
LUK.2.10	And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.
LUK.2.11	For unto you is born this day in the city of David 
LUK.2.12	And this 
LUK.2.13	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God-Theos, and saying,
LUK.2.14	Glory to God-Theos in the highest, and on earth peace among men of God’s good pleasure or choosing..
LUK.2.15	And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Beit-Lechem 
LUK.2.16	And they came with haste, and found Miryam 
LUK.2.17	And when they had seen 
LUK.2.18	And all they that heard 
LUK.2.19	But Miryam 
LUK.2.20	And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God-Theos for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.
LUK.2.21	And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called YESHUA 
LUK.2.22	And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moshe 
LUK.2.23	(As it is written in the law of the Lord - Kurios, Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord - Kurios;)
LUK.2.24	And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord - Kurios, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.
LUK.2.25	And, behold, there was a man in Yerushalayim 
LUK.2.26	And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit 
LUK.2.27	And he came by the Spirit 
LUK.2.28	Then took he him up in his arms, and Blessed 
LUK.2.29	Lord - Kurios, now let you
LUK.2.30	For my eyes have seen your
LUK.2.31	Which you
LUK.2.32	A light to lighten the Goyim 
LUK.2.33	And Yosef 
LUK.2.34	And Shim’on 
LUK.2.35	(Yes, a sword shall pierce through your
LUK.2.36	And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the Bat-P’nu’el 
LUK.2.37	And she 
LUK.2.38	And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord - Kurios, and spoke of him to all them that looked for redemption in Yerushalayim 
LUK.2.39	And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord - Kurios, they returned into Galil 
LUK.2.40	And the child grew, and waxed strong in Spirit 
LUK.2.41	Now his parents went to Yerushalayim 
LUK.2.42	And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Yerushalayim 
LUK.2.43	And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Yeshua 
LUK.2.44	But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day’s journey; and they sought him among 
LUK.2.45	And when they found him not, they turned back again to Yerushalayim 
LUK.2.46	And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.
LUK.2.47	And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.
LUK.2.48	And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why have you
LUK.2.49	And he said unto them, How is it that you
LUK.2.50	And they understood not the saying which he spoke unto them.
LUK.2.51	And he went down with them, and came to Natzeret 
LUK.2.52	And Yeshua 
LUK.3.1	Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius 
LUK.3.2	‘Anan 
LUK.3.3	And he came into all the country about Yarden 
LUK.3.4	As it is written in the book of the words of Yesha’yahu 
LUK.3.5	Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways 
LUK.3.6	And all flesh shall see the salvation of God-Theos.
LUK.3.7	Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
LUK.3.8	Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Avraham 
LUK.3.9	And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which brings not forth good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire.
LUK.3.10	And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?
LUK.3.11	He answer and says unto them, He that has two coats, let him impart to him that has none; and he that has meat, let him do likewise.
LUK.3.12	Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do?
LUK.3.13	And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you.
LUK.3.14	And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse 
LUK.3.15	And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of Yochanan 
LUK.3.16	Yochanan 
LUK.3.17	Whose fan 
LUK.3.18	And many other things in his Exhortation 
LUK.3.19	But Herod 
LUK.3.20	Added yet this above all, that he shut up Yochanan 
LUK.3.21	Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Yeshua 
LUK.3.22	And the Holy Spirit 
LUK.3.23	And Yeshua 
LUK.3.24	Which was 
LUK.3.25	Which was 
LUK.3.26	Which was 
LUK.3.27	Which was 
LUK.3.28	Which was 
LUK.3.29	Which was 
LUK.3.30	Which was 
LUK.3.31	Which was 
LUK.3.32	Which was 
LUK.3.33	Which was 
LUK.3.34	Which was 
LUK.3.35	Which was 
LUK.3.36	Which was 
LUK.3.37	Which was 
LUK.3.38	Which was 
LUK.4.1	And Yeshua 
LUK.4.2	Being forty days tried or tested of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered.
LUK.4.3	And the devil said unto him, If you
LUK.4.4	And Yeshua 
LUK.4.5	And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
LUK.4.6	And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give you
LUK.4.7	If you
LUK.4.8	And Yeshua 
LUK.4.9	And he brought him to Yerushalayim 
LUK.4.10	For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over you
LUK.4.11	And in 
LUK.4.12	And Yeshua 
LUK.4.13	And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season.
LUK.4.14	And Yeshua 
LUK.4.15	And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.
LUK.4.16	And he came to Natzeret 
LUK.4.17	And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Yesha’yahu 
LUK.4.18	The Spirit 
LUK.4.19	To preach the acceptable year of the Lord - Kurios-Yehovah.
LUK.4.20	And he closed the book, and he gave 
LUK.4.21	And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.
LUK.4.22	And all bore him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Yosef 
LUK.4.23	And he said unto them, You
LUK.4.24	And he said, Truly I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.
LUK.4.25	But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Yisra’el 
LUK.4.26	But unto none of them was Eliyahu 
LUK.4.27	And many lepers were in Yisra’el 
LUK.4.28	And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,
LUK.4.29	And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.
LUK.4.30	But he passing through the midst of them went his way,
LUK.4.31	And came down to K’far-Nachum 
LUK.4.32	And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.
LUK.4.33	And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a Spirit 
LUK.4.34	Saying, Let 
LUK.4.35	And Yeshua 
LUK.4.36	And they were all amazed, and spoke among themselves, saying, What a word 
LUK.4.37	And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about.
LUK.4.38	And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Shim’on 
LUK.4.39	And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.
LUK.4.40	Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with different diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.
LUK.4.41	And demons also came out of many, crying out, and saying, you
LUK.4.42	And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and detained 
LUK.4.43	And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God-Theos to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.
LUK.4.44	And he preached in the synagogues of Galil 
LUK.5.1	And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God-Theos, he stood by the lake of Kinneret 
LUK.5.2	And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing 
LUK.5.3	And he entered into one of the ships, which was Shim’on 
LUK.5.4	Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Shim’on 
LUK.5.5	And Shim’on 
LUK.5.6	And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net broke.
LUK.5.7	And they beckoned unto 
LUK.5.8	When Shim’on 
LUK.5.9	For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:
LUK.5.10	And so 
LUK.5.11	And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.
LUK.5.12	And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Yeshua 
LUK.5.13	And he put forth 
LUK.5.14	And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your
LUK.5.15	But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.
LUK.5.16	And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.
LUK.5.17	And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were P’rushim 
LUK.5.18	And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought 
LUK.5.19	And when they could not find by what 
LUK.5.20	And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, your
LUK.5.21	And the Torah-teachers 
LUK.5.22	But when Yeshua 
LUK.5.23	Whether is easier, to say, You
LUK.5.24	But that you
LUK.5.25	And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God-Theos.
LUK.5.26	And they were all amazed, and they glorified God-Theos, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.
LUK.5.27	And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican 
LUK.5.28	And he left all, rose up, and followed him.
LUK.5.29	And Levi 
LUK.5.30	But their Torah-teachers 
LUK.5.31	And Yeshua 
LUK.5.32	I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
LUK.5.33	And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of Yochanan 
LUK.5.34	And he said unto them, Can you
LUK.5.35	But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.
LUK.5.36	And he spoke also a parable unto them; No man puts a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new makes a rent, and the piece that was 
LUK.5.37	And no man puts New Wine into old bottles; else the New Wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.
LUK.5.38	But New Wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.
LUK.5.39	No man also having drunk old 
LUK.6.1	And it came to pass on the second Shabbat 
LUK.6.2	And certain of the P’rushim 
LUK.6.3	And Yeshua 
LUK.6.4	How he went into the house of God-Theos, and did take and eat the showbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?
LUK.6.5	And he said unto them, That the Son of Man is Lord - Kurios also of the Shabbat 
LUK.6.6	And it came to pass also on another Shabbat 
LUK.6.7	And the Torah-teachers 
LUK.6.8	But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.
LUK.6.9	Then said Yeshua 
LUK.6.10	And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth your
LUK.6.11	And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Yeshua 
LUK.6.12	And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God-Theos.
LUK.6.13	And when it was day, he called 
LUK.6.14	Shim’on 
LUK.6.15	Mattityahu 
LUK.6.16	And Y’hudah 
LUK.6.17	And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Y’hudah 
LUK.6.18	And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.
LUK.6.19	And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue 
LUK.6.20	And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed 
LUK.6.21	Blessed 
LUK.6.22	Blessed 
LUK.6.23	Rejoice you
LUK.6.24	But woe unto you that are rich! for you
LUK.6.25	Woe unto you that are full! for you
LUK.6.26	Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.
LUK.6.27	But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,
LUK.6.28	Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.
LUK.6.29	And unto him that smites you
LUK.6.30	Give to every man that asks of you
LUK.6.31	And as you
LUK.6.32	For if you
LUK.6.33	And if you
LUK.6.34	And if you
LUK.6.35	But love you
LUK.6.36	Be you
LUK.6.37	Judge not, and you
LUK.6.38	Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that you
LUK.6.39	And he spoke a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?
LUK.6.40	The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.
LUK.6.41	And why behold you
LUK.6.42	Either how can you
LUK.6.43	For a good tree brings not forth corrupt fruit; neither does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
LUK.6.44	For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.
LUK.6.45	A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.
LUK.6.46	And why call you
LUK.6.47	Whosoever comes to me, and hears my sayings, and does them, I will show you to whom he is like:
LUK.6.48	He is like a man which built an house, and excavated deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.
LUK.6.49	But he that hears, and does not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.
LUK.7.1	Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into K’far-Nachum 
LUK.7.2	And a certain Centurion (Roman commander of an hundred men)’s slave, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.
LUK.7.3	And when he heard of Yeshua 
LUK.7.4	And when they came to Yeshua 
LUK.7.5	For he loves our nation, and he has built us a synagogue.
LUK.7.6	Then Yeshua 
LUK.7.7	For what reason neither thought I myself worthy to come unto you
LUK.7.8	For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my slave, Do this, and he does 
LUK.7.9	When Yeshua 
LUK.7.10	And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the slave whole that had been sick.
LUK.7.11	And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.
LUK.7.12	Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.
LUK.7.13	And when the Lord - Kurios saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.
LUK.7.14	And he came and touched the bier: and they that bore 
LUK.7.15	And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.
LUK.7.16	And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God-Theos, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God-Theos has visited his people.
LUK.7.17	And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Y’hudah 
LUK.7.18	And the disciples of Yochanan 
LUK.7.19	And Yochanan 
LUK.7.20	When the men were come unto him, they said, Yochanan 
LUK.7.21	And in that same hour he cured many of 
LUK.7.22	Then Yeshua 
LUK.7.23	And Blessed 
LUK.7.24	And when the messengers of Yochanan 
LUK.7.25	But what went you
LUK.7.26	But what went you
LUK.7.27	This is 
LUK.7.28	For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than Yochanan 
LUK.7.29	And all the people that heard 
LUK.7.30	But the P’rushim 
LUK.7.31	And the Lord - Kurios said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?
LUK.7.32	They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and you
LUK.7.33	For Yochanan 
LUK.7.34	The Son of Man is come eating and drinking; and you
LUK.7.35	But wisdom is justified of all her children.
LUK.7.36	And one of the P’rushim 
LUK.7.37	And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that [Yeshua 
LUK.7.38	And stood at his feet behind 
LUK.7.39	Now when the Pharisee 
LUK.7.40	And Yeshua 
LUK.7.41	There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.
LUK.7.42	And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?
LUK.7.43	Shim’on 
LUK.7.44	And he turned to the woman, and said unto Shim’on 
LUK.7.45	you
LUK.7.46	My head with oil you
LUK.7.47	For what reason I say unto you
LUK.7.48	And he said unto her, You
LUK.7.49	And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?
LUK.7.50	And he said to the woman, You
LUK.8.1	And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God-Theos: and the twelve 
LUK.8.2	And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Miryam 
LUK.8.3	And Yochanan 
LUK.8.4	And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spoke by a parable:
LUK.8.5	A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trampled down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.
LUK.8.6	And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.
LUK.8.7	And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.
LUK.8.8	And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bore fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that has ears to hear, let him hear.
LUK.8.9	And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?
LUK.8.10	And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God-Theos: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.
LUK.8.11	Now the parable is this: The seed is the Word of God-The Father.
LUK.8.12	Those by the way side are they that hear; then comes the devil, and takes away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.
LUK.8.13	They on the rock 
LUK.8.14	And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of 
LUK.8.15	But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep 
LUK.8.16	No man, when he has lighted a candle, covers it with a vessel, or puts 
LUK.8.17	For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither 
LUK.8.18	Take heed therefore how you
LUK.8.19	Then came to him 
LUK.8.20	And it was told him 
LUK.8.21	And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the Word of God-The Father, and do it.
LUK.8.22	Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.
LUK.8.23	But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled 
LUK.8.24	And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.
LUK.8.25	And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commands even the winds and water, and they obey him.
LUK.8.26	And they arrived at the country of the Gerasenes’ 
LUK.8.27	And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had demons long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in 
LUK.8.28	When he saw Yeshua 
LUK.8.29	(For he had commanded the unclean Spirit 
LUK.8.30	And Yeshua 
LUK.8.31	And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.
LUK.8.32	And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer 
LUK.8.33	Then went the demons out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.
LUK.8.34	When they that fed 
LUK.8.35	Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Yeshua 
LUK.8.36	They also which saw 
LUK.8.37	Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gerasenes’ 
LUK.8.38	Now the man out of whom the demons were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Yeshua 
LUK.8.39	Return to your
LUK.8.40	And it came to pass, that, when Yeshua 
LUK.8.41	And, behold, there came a man named Ya’ir 
LUK.8.42	For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.
LUK.8.43	And a woman having an issue 
LUK.8.44	Came behind 
LUK.8.45	And Yeshua 
LUK.8.46	And Yeshua 
LUK.8.47	And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.
LUK.8.48	And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: your
LUK.8.49	While he yet spoke, there comes one from the ruler of the synagogue’s 
LUK.8.50	But when Yeshua 
LUK.8.51	And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Kefa 
LUK.8.52	And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleeps.
LUK.8.53	And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.
LUK.8.54	And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.
LUK.8.55	And her Spirit 
LUK.8.56	And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.
LUK.9.1	Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.
LUK.9.2	And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God-Theos, and to heal the sick.
LUK.9.3	And he said unto them, Take nothing for 
LUK.9.4	And whatsoever house you
LUK.9.5	And whosoever will not receive you, when you
LUK.9.6	And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the Gospel 
LUK.9.7	Now Herod 
LUK.9.8	And of some, that Eliyahu 
LUK.9.9	And Herod 
LUK.9.10	And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Beit-Tzaidah 
LUK.9.11	And the people, when they knew 
LUK.9.12	And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals 
LUK.9.13	But he said unto them, Give you
LUK.9.14	For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.
LUK.9.15	And they did so, and made them all sit down.
LUK.9.16	Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he Blessed 
LUK.9.17	And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.
LUK.9.18	And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?
LUK.9.19	They answering said, Yochanan 
LUK.9.20	He said unto them, But whom say you
LUK.9.21	And he straitly charged them, and commanded 
LUK.9.22	Saying, The Son of Man must suffer 
LUK.9.23	And he said to 
LUK.9.24	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.
LUK.9.25	For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?
LUK.9.26	For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of Man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and 
LUK.9.27	But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God-Theos.
LUK.9.28	And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Kefa 
LUK.9.29	And as he prayed, the fashion of his Countenance 
LUK.9.30	And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moshe 
LUK.9.31	Who appeared in glory, and spoke of his decease which he should accomplish at Yerushalayim 
LUK.9.32	But Kefa 
LUK.9.33	And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Kefa 
LUK.9.34	While he thus spoke, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.
LUK.9.35	And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.
LUK.9.36	And when the voice was past, Yeshua 
LUK.9.37	And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.
LUK.9.38	And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech 
LUK.9.39	And, lo, a Spirit 
LUK.9.40	And I besought you
LUK.9.41	And Yeshua 
LUK.9.42	And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare 
LUK.9.43	And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God-Theos. But while they wondered every one at all things which Yeshua 
LUK.9.44	Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of Man shall be delivered into the hands of men.
LUK.9.45	But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.
LUK.9.46	Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.
LUK.9.47	And Yeshua 
LUK.9.48	And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receives me: and whosoever shall receive me receives him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.
LUK.9.49	And Yochanan 
LUK.9.50	And Yeshua 
LUK.9.51	And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Yerushalayim 
LUK.9.52	And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Shomronim 
LUK.9.53	And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Yerushalayim 
LUK.9.54	And when his disciples Ya’akov 
LUK.9.55	But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, You
LUK.9.56	For the Son of Man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save 
LUK.9.57	And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain 
LUK.9.58	And Yeshua 
LUK.9.59	And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord - Kurios, suffer 
LUK.9.60	Yeshua 
LUK.9.61	And another also said, Lord - Kurios, I will follow you
LUK.9.62	And Yeshua 
LUK.10.1	After these things the Lord - Kurios appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, to which he himself would come.
LUK.10.2	Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly 
LUK.10.3	Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.
LUK.10.4	Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way.
LUK.10.5	And into whatsoever house you
LUK.10.6	And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.
LUK.10.7	And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.
LUK.10.8	And into whatsoever city you
LUK.10.9	And heal the sick that are in it, and say unto them, The kingdom of God-Theos is come near unto you.
LUK.10.10	But into whatsoever city you
LUK.10.11	Even the very dust of your city, which cleaves on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be you
LUK.10.12	But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for S’dom 
LUK.10.13	Woe unto you
LUK.10.14	But it shall be more tolerable for Tzor 
LUK.10.15	And you
LUK.10.16	He that hears you hears me; and he that despises you despises me; and he that despises me despises him that sent me.
LUK.10.17	And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord - Kurios, even the demons are subject unto us through your
LUK.10.18	And he said unto them, I beheld Satan 
LUK.10.19	Behold, I give unto you power to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.
LUK.10.20	Yet in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.
LUK.10.21	In that hour Yeshua 
LUK.10.22	And having turned to the disciples, he said: All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knows who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and 
LUK.10.23	And he turned him unto 
LUK.10.24	For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which you
LUK.10.25	And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tried or tested him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
LUK.10.26	He said unto him, What is written in the law? how read you
LUK.10.27	And he answering said, you
LUK.10.28	And he said unto him, you
LUK.10.29	But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Yeshua 
LUK.10.30	And Yeshua 
LUK.10.31	And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
LUK.10.32	And likewise a Levi 
LUK.10.33	But a certain Shomroni 
LUK.10.34	And went to 
LUK.10.35	And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave 
LUK.10.36	Which now of these three, think you
LUK.10.37	And he said, He that showed mercy on him. Then said Yeshua 
LUK.10.38	Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Marta 
LUK.10.39	And she had a sister called Miryam 
LUK.10.40	But Marta 
LUK.10.41	And Yeshua 
LUK.10.42	But one thing is needful: and Miryam 
LUK.11.1	And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord - Kurios, teach us to pray, as Yochanan 
LUK.11.2	And he said unto them, When you
LUK.11.3	Give us day by day our daily bread.
LUK.11.4	And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.
LUK.11.5	And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;
LUK.11.6	For a friend of my in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?
LUK.11.7	And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give you
LUK.11.8	I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needs.
LUK.11.9	And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you
LUK.11.10	For every one that asks receives; and he that seeks finds; and to him that knocks it shall be opened.
LUK.11.11	If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if 
LUK.11.12	Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?
LUK.11.13	If you
LUK.11.14	And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spoke; and the people wondered.
LUK.11.15	But some of them said, He casts out demons through Beelzebub the chief of the demons.
LUK.11.16	And others, tempting 
LUK.11.17	But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house 
LUK.11.18	If Satan 
LUK.11.19	And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast 
LUK.11.20	But if I with the finger of God-Theos cast out demons, no doubt the kingdom of God-Theos is come upon you.
LUK.11.21	When a strong man armed keeps his palace, his goods are in peace:
LUK.11.22	But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he takes from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divides his spoils.
LUK.11.23	He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathers not with me scatters.
LUK.11.24	When the unclean Spirit 
LUK.11.25	And when he comes, he finds 
LUK.11.26	Then goes he, and takes 
LUK.11.27	And it came to pass, as he spoke these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed 
LUK.11.28	But he said, Yes rather, Blessed 
LUK.11.29	And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Yochanan 
LUK.11.30	For as Yochanan 
LUK.11.31	The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Shlomo 
LUK.11.32	The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Yochanan 
LUK.11.33	No man, when he has lighted a candle, puts 
LUK.11.34	The light of the body is the eye: therefore when your
LUK.11.35	Take heed therefore that the light which is in you
LUK.11.36	If your
LUK.11.37	And as he spoke, a certain Pharisee 
LUK.11.38	And when the Pharisee 
LUK.11.39	And the Lord - Kurios said unto him, Now do you
LUK.11.41	But rather give alms of such things as you
LUK.11.42	But woe unto you, P’rushim (Pharisee 
LUK.11.43	Woe unto you, P’rushim (Pharisee 
LUK.11.44	Woe unto you, Torah-teachers 
LUK.11.45	Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying you
LUK.11.46	And he said, Woe unto you also, 
LUK.11.47	Woe unto you! for you
LUK.11.48	Truly you
LUK.11.49	Therefore also said the wisdom of God-Theos, I will send them prophets and apostles, and 
LUK.11.50	That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
LUK.11.51	From the blood of Hevel 
LUK.11.52	Woe unto you, lawyers! for you
LUK.11.53	And as he said these things unto them, the Torah-teachers 
LUK.11.54	Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.
LUK.12.1	In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trampled one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware you
LUK.12.2	For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.
LUK.12.3	Therefore whatsoever you
LUK.12.4	And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
LUK.12.5	But I will forewarn you whom you
LUK.12.6	Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God-Theos?
LUK.12.7	But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: you
LUK.12.8	Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God-Theos:
LUK.12.9	But he that denies me before men shall be denied before the angels of God-Theos.
LUK.12.10	And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemes against the Holy Spirit 
LUK.12.11	And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and 
LUK.12.12	For the Holy Spirit 
LUK.12.13	And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.
LUK.12.14	And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?
LUK.12.15	And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man’s life consists not in the abundance of the things which he possesses.
LUK.12.16	And he spoke a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:
LUK.12.17	And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?
LUK.12.18	And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.
LUK.12.19	And I will say to my soul, Soul, you
LUK.12.20	But God-Theos said unto him, 
LUK.12.21	So 
LUK.12.22	And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what you
LUK.12.23	The life is more than meat, and the body 
LUK.12.24	Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God-Theos feeds them: how much more are you
LUK.12.25	And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?
LUK.12.26	If you
LUK.12.27	Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Shlomo 
LUK.12.28	If then God- The Father so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and tomorrow is cast into the oven; how much more 
LUK.12.29	And seek not you
LUK.12.30	For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knows that you
LUK.12.31	But rather seek you
LUK.12.32	Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
LUK.12.33	Sell that you
LUK.12.34	For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
LUK.12.35	Let your waist be girded about, and 
LUK.12.36	And you
LUK.12.37	Blessed 
LUK.12.38	And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find 
LUK.12.39	And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through.
LUK.12.40	Be you
LUK.12.41	Then Kefa 
LUK.12.42	And the Lord - Kurios said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom 
LUK.12.43	Blessed 
LUK.12.44	Of a tI say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he has.
LUK.12.45	But and if that slave say in his heart, My lord delays his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;
LUK.12.46	The lord of that slave will come in a day when he looks not for 
LUK.12.47	And that slave, which knew his lord’s will, and prepared not 
LUK.12.48	But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few 
LUK.12.49	I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?
LUK.12.50	But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened 
LUK.12.51	Suppose you
LUK.12.52	For from from this time forth 
LUK.12.53	The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.
LUK.12.54	And he said also to the people, When you
LUK.12.55	And when 
LUK.12.57	Yes, and why even of yourselves judge you
LUK.12.58	When you
LUK.12.59	I tell you
LUK.13.1	There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans 
LUK.13.2	And Yeshua 
LUK.13.3	I tell you, No: but, except you
LUK.13.4	Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them, think you
LUK.13.5	I tell you, No: but, except you
LUK.13.6	He spoke also this parable; A certain 
LUK.13.7	Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbers it the ground?
LUK.13.8	And he answering said unto him, Lord - Kurios, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung 
LUK.13.9	And if it bear fruit, 
LUK.13.10	And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Shabbat 
LUK.13.11	And, behold, there was a woman which had a Spirit 
LUK.13.12	And when Yeshua 
LUK.13.13	And he laid 
LUK.13.14	And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Yeshua 
LUK.13.15	The Lord - Kurios then answered him, and said, 
LUK.13.16	And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Avraham 
LUK.13.17	And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.
LUK.13.18	Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God-The Father like? and whereunto shall I resemble it?
LUK.13.19	It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.
LUK.13.20	And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God-The Father?
LUK.13.21	It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
LUK.13.22	And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Yerushalayim 
LUK.13.23	Then said one unto him, Lord - Kurios-Adon, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them,
LUK.13.24	Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.
LUK.13.25	When once the master of the house is risen up, and has shut to the door, and you
LUK.13.26	Then shall you
LUK.13.27	But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not from what place you
LUK.13.28	There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you
LUK.13.29	And they shall come from the east, and 
LUK.13.30	And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last.
LUK.13.31	The same day there came certain of the P’rushim (Pharisee 
LUK.13.32	And he said unto them, Go you
LUK.13.33	Nevertheless I must walk to day, and tomorrow, and the 
LUK.13.34	O Yerushalayim 
LUK.13.35	Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and truly I say unto you, You
LUK.14.1	And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief P’rushim 
LUK.14.2	And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy 
LUK.14.3	And Yeshua 
LUK.14.4	And they held their peace. And he took 
LUK.14.5	And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not immediately pull him out on the Shabbat 
LUK.14.6	And they could not answer him again to these things.
LUK.14.7	And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them,
LUK.14.8	When you
LUK.14.9	And he that bade you
LUK.14.10	But when you
LUK.14.11	For whosoever exalts himself shall be abased; and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.
LUK.14.12	Then said he also to him that bade him, When you
LUK.14.13	But when you
LUK.14.14	And you
LUK.14.15	And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed 
LUK.14.16	Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:
LUK.14.17	And sent his slave at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.
LUK.14.18	And they all with one 
LUK.14.19	And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray you
LUK.14.20	And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.
LUK.14.21	So that slave came, and showed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his slave, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor, and the maimed, and the lame 
LUK.14.22	And the slave said, Lord - Kurios-Adon, it is done as you
LUK.14.23	And the lord said unto the slave, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel 
LUK.14.24	For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper.
LUK.14.25	And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them,
LUK.14.26	If any 
LUK.14.27	And whosoever does not bear his stake 
LUK.14.28	For which of you, intending to build a tower, sits not down first, and count the cost, whether he have 
LUK.14.29	Lest perhaps 
LUK.14.30	Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.
LUK.14.31	Or what king, going to make war against another king, sits not down first, and consult whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that comes against him with twenty thousand?
LUK.14.32	Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he send an ambassage, and desires conditions of peace.
LUK.14.33	So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsake not all that he has, he cannot be my disciple.
LUK.14.34	Salt 
LUK.14.35	It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; 
LUK.15.1	Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.
LUK.15.2	And the P’rushim 
LUK.15.3	And he spoke this parable unto them, saying,
LUK.15.4	What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, does not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?
LUK.15.5	And when he has found 
LUK.15.6	And when he comes home, he calls together 
LUK.15.7	I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repents, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.
LUK.15.8	Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, does not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find 
LUK.15.9	And when she has found 
LUK.15.10	Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God-Theos over one sinner that repents.
LUK.15.11	And he said, A certain man had two sons:
LUK.15.12	And the younger of them said to 
LUK.15.13	And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.
LUK.15.14	And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.
LUK.15.15	And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
LUK.15.16	And he would fain 
LUK.15.17	And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!
LUK.15.18	I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before you
LUK.15.19	And am no more worthy to be called your
LUK.15.20	And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.
LUK.15.21	And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your
LUK.15.22	But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put 
LUK.15.23	And bring here the fatted calf, and kill 
LUK.15.24	For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.
LUK.15.25	Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.
LUK.15.26	And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.
LUK.15.27	And he said unto him, You
LUK.15.28	And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.
LUK.15.29	And he answering said to 
LUK.15.30	But as soon as this your
LUK.15.31	And he said unto him, Son, you
LUK.15.32	It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this your
LUK.16.1	And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.
LUK.16.2	And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of you
LUK.16.3	Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord takes away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.
LUK.16.4	I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.
LUK.16.5	So he called every one of his lord’s debtors 
LUK.16.6	And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take your
LUK.16.7	Then said he to another, And how much owe you
LUK.16.8	And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.
LUK.16.9	And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon 
LUK.16.10	He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.
LUK.16.11	If therefore you
LUK.16.12	And if you
LUK.16.13	No slave can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You
LUK.16.14	And the P’rushim 
LUK.16.15	And he said unto them, You
LUK.16.16	The law and the prophets 
LUK.16.17	And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the Torah to fail.
LUK.16.18	Whosoever puts away his wife, and marries another, commit adultery: and whosoever marries her that is put away from 
LUK.16.19	There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:
LUK.16.20	And there was a certain beggar named El’azar 
LUK.16.21	And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
LUK.16.22	And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Avraham 
LUK.16.23	And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and sees Avraham 
LUK.16.24	And he cried and said, Father Avraham 
LUK.16.25	But Avraham 
LUK.16.26	And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that 
LUK.16.27	Then he said, I pray you
LUK.16.28	For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
LUK.16.29	Avraham 
LUK.16.30	And he said, No, father Avraham 
LUK.16.31	And he said unto him, If they hear not Moshe 
LUK.17.1	Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe 
LUK.17.2	It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend 
LUK.17.3	Take heed to yourselves: If your
LUK.17.4	And if he trespass against you
LUK.17.5	And the apostles said unto the Lord - Kurios, Increase our faith.
LUK.17.6	And the Lord - Kurios-Adon said, If you
LUK.17.7	But which of you, having a slave plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?
LUK.17.8	And will not rather say unto him, Make ready which I may eat, and gird yourself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward you
LUK.17.9	Does he thank that slave because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow 
LUK.17.10	So likewise you
LUK.17.11	And it came to pass, as he went to Yerushalayim 
LUK.17.12	And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:
LUK.17.13	And they lifted up 
LUK.17.14	And when he saw 
LUK.17.15	And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God-Theos,
LUK.17.16	And fell down on 
LUK.17.17	And Yeshua 
LUK.17.18	There are not found that returned to give glory to God-Theos, save this stranger.
LUK.17.19	And he said unto him, Arise, go your
LUK.17.20	And when he was demanded of the P’rushim (Pharisee 
LUK.17.21	Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God-The Father is within you.
LUK.17.22	And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when you
LUK.17.23	And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after 
LUK.17.24	For as the lightning, that lightens out of the one 
LUK.17.25	But first must he suffer 
LUK.17.26	And as it was in the days of Noach 
LUK.17.27	They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noach 
LUK.17.28	Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;
LUK.17.29	But the same day that Lot went out of S’dom 
LUK.17.30	Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed.
LUK.17.31	In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.
LUK.17.32	Remember Lot’s wife.
LUK.17.33	Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.
LUK.17.34	I tell you, in that night there shall be two 
LUK.17.35	Two 
LUK.17.36	Two 
LUK.17.37	And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord - Kurios? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body 
LUK.18.1	And he spoke a parable unto them 
LUK.18.2	Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God-Theos, neither regarded man:
LUK.18.3	And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of my adversary.
LUK.18.4	And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God-Theos, nor regard man;
LUK.18.5	Yet because this widow troubles me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.
LUK.18.6	And the Lord - Kurios said, Hear what the unjust judge says.
LUK.18.7	And shall not God-Theos avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?
LUK.18.8	I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of Man comes, shall he find faith on the earth?
LUK.18.9	And he spoke this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:
LUK.18.10	Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee 
LUK.18.11	The Pharisee 
LUK.18.12	I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I acquire.
LUK.18.13	And the publican 
LUK.18.14	I tell you, this man went down to his house justified 
LUK.18.15	And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when 
LUK.18.16	But Yeshua 
LUK.18.17	Truly I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God-Theos as a little child shall assuredly not 
LUK.18.18	And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
LUK.18.19	And Yeshua 
LUK.18.20	you
LUK.18.21	And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.
LUK.18.22	Now when Yeshua 
LUK.18.23	And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.
LUK.18.24	And when Yeshua 
LUK.18.25	For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God-Theos.
LUK.18.26	And they that heard 
LUK.18.27	And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God-Theos.
LUK.18.28	Then Kefa 
LUK.18.29	And he said unto them, Truly I say unto you, There is no man that has left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God-Theos’s sake,
LUK.18.30	Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.
LUK.18.31	Then he took 
LUK.18.32	For he shall be delivered unto the Goyim 
LUK.18.33	And they shall scourge 
LUK.18.34	And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.
LUK.18.35	And it came to pass, that as he was come near unto Yericho 
LUK.18.36	And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.
LUK.18.37	And they told him, that Yeshua 
LUK.18.38	And he cried, saying, Yeshua 
LUK.18.39	And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, 
LUK.18.40	And Yeshua 
LUK.18.41	Saying, What will you
LUK.18.42	And Yeshua 
LUK.18.43	And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God-Theos: and all the people, when they saw 
LUK.19.1	And [Yeshua 
LUK.19.2	And, behold, 
LUK.19.3	And he sought to see Yeshua 
LUK.19.4	And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that 
LUK.19.5	And when Yeshua 
LUK.19.6	And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.
LUK.19.7	And when they saw 
LUK.19.8	And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord - Kurios; Behold, Lord - Kurios, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore 
LUK.19.9	And Yeshua 
LUK.19.10	For the Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.
LUK.19.11	And as they heard these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was near to Yerushalayim 
LUK.19.12	He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.
LUK.19.13	And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.
LUK.19.14	But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this 
LUK.19.15	And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.
LUK.19.16	Then came the first, saying, Lord - Kurios, your
LUK.19.17	And he said unto him, Well, you
LUK.19.18	And the second came, saying, Lord - Kurios, your
LUK.19.19	And he said likewise to him, Be you
LUK.19.20	And another came, saying, Lord - Kurios, behold, 
LUK.19.21	For I feared you
LUK.19.22	And he says unto him, Out of your
LUK.19.23	For what reason then gave not your
LUK.19.24	And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give 
LUK.19.25	(And they said unto him, Lord - Kurios, he has ten pounds.)
LUK.19.26	For I say unto you, That unto every one which has shall be given; and from him that has not, even that he has shall be taken away from him.
LUK.19.27	But those my enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring here, and slay 
LUK.19.28	And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Yerushalayim 
LUK.19.29	And it came to pass, when he was come near to Beit-Pagei 
LUK.19.30	Saying, Go you
LUK.19.31	And if any man ask you, Why do you
LUK.19.32	And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.
LUK.19.33	And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose you
LUK.19.34	And they said, The Lord - Kurios has need of him.
LUK.19.35	And they brought him to Yeshua 
LUK.19.36	And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.
LUK.19.37	And when he was come near, even now at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God-Theos with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;
LUK.19.38	Saying, Blessed 
LUK.19.39	And some of the P’rushim 
LUK.19.40	And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.
LUK.19.41	And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,
LUK.19.42	Saying, If you
LUK.19.43	For the days shall come upon you
LUK.19.44	And shall lay you
LUK.19.45	And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold in it, and them that bought;
LUK.19.46	Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but you
LUK.19.47	And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the Torah-teachers 
LUK.19.48	And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.
LUK.20.1	And it came to pass, 
LUK.20.2	And spoke unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority do you
LUK.20.3	And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:
LUK.20.4	The baptism of Yochanan 
LUK.20.5	And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed you
LUK.20.6	But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that Yochanan 
LUK.20.7	And they answered, that they could not tell from what place 
LUK.20.8	And Yeshua 
LUK.20.9	Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.
LUK.20.10	And at the season he sent a slave to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent 
LUK.20.11	And again he sent another slave: and they beat him also, and entreated 
LUK.20.12	And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast 
LUK.20.13	Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence 
LUK.20.14	But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.
LUK.20.15	So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed 
LUK.20.16	He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard 
LUK.20.17	And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?
LUK.20.18	Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
LUK.20.19	And the chief priests and the Torah-teachers 
LUK.20.20	And they watched 
LUK.20.21	And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that you
LUK.20.22	Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar 
LUK.20.23	But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt you
LUK.20.24	Show me a penny. Whose image and superscription has it? They answered and said, Caesar 
LUK.20.25	And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar 
LUK.20.26	And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.
LUK.20.27	Then came to 
LUK.20.28	Saying, Master, Moshe 
LUK.20.29	There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.
LUK.20.30	And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.
LUK.20.31	And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.
LUK.20.32	Last of all the woman died also.
LUK.20.33	Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.
LUK.20.34	And Yeshua 
LUK.20.35	But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:
LUK.20.36	Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God-Theos, being the children of the resurrection.
LUK.20.37	Now that the dead are raised, even Moshe 
LUK.20.38	For he is not a God-Theos of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.
LUK.20.39	Then certain of the Torah-teachers 
LUK.20.40	And after that they dared 
LUK.20.41	And he said unto them, How say they that Moshiach 
LUK.20.42	And David 
LUK.20.43	Till I make your
LUK.20.44	David 
LUK.20.45	Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,
LUK.20.46	Beware of the Torah-teachers 
LUK.20.47	Which devour widows’ houses, and for a show make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.
LUK.21.1	And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.
LUK.21.2	And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in there two mites.
LUK.21.3	And he said, Of a tI say unto you, that this poor widow has cast in more than they all:
LUK.21.4	For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God-Theos: but she of her poverty has cast in all the living that she had.
LUK.21.5	And as some spoke of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,
LUK.21.7	And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign 
LUK.21.8	And he said, Take heed that you
LUK.21.9	But when you
LUK.21.10	Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
LUK.21.11	And great earthquakes shall be in different places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.
LUK.21.12	But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute 
LUK.21.13	And it shall turn to you for a testimony.
LUK.21.14	Settle 
LUK.21.15	For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to contradict 
LUK.21.16	And you
LUK.21.17	And you
LUK.21.18	But there shall not an hair of your head perish.
LUK.21.19	In your patience possess you
LUK.21.20	And when you
LUK.21.21	Then let them which are in Y’hudah 
LUK.21.22	For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
LUK.21.23	But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.
LUK.21.24	And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Yerushalayim 
LUK.21.25	And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;
LUK.21.26	Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.
LUK.21.27	And then shall they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
LUK.21.28	And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draws near.
LUK.21.29	And he spoke to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;
LUK.21.30	When they now shoot forth, you
LUK.21.31	So likewise you
LUK.21.32	Truly I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.
LUK.21.33	Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
LUK.21.34	And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be burdened 
LUK.21.35	For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.
LUK.21.36	Watch you
LUK.21.37	And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called 
LUK.21.38	And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him.
LUK.22.1	Now the feast of unleavened bread drew near, which is called the Passover.
LUK.22.2	And the chief priests and Torah-teachers 
LUK.22.3	Then entered Satan 
LUK.22.4	And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.
LUK.22.5	And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.
LUK.22.6	And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.
LUK.22.7	Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the Passover must be killed.
LUK.22.8	And he sent Kefa 
LUK.22.9	And they said unto him, Where will you
LUK.22.10	And he said unto them, Behold, when you
LUK.22.11	And you
LUK.22.12	And he shall show you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.
LUK.22.13	And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the Passover.
LUK.22.14	And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.
LUK.22.15	And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer 
LUK.22.16	For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God-Theos.
LUK.22.17	And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide 
LUK.22.18	For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God-Theos shall come.
LUK.22.19	And he took bread, and gave thanks, and broke 
LUK.22.20	Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup 
LUK.22.21	But, behold, the hand of him that betrays me 
LUK.22.22	And truly the Son of Man goes, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!
LUK.22.23	And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.
LUK.22.24	And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.
LUK.22.25	And he said unto them, The kings of the Goyim 
LUK.22.26	But you
LUK.22.27	For whether 
LUK.22.28	You
LUK.22.29	And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father has appointed unto me;
LUK.22.30	That you
LUK.22.31	And the Lord - Kurios said, Shim’on 
LUK.22.32	But I have prayed for you
LUK.22.33	And he said unto him, Lord - Kurios, I am ready to go with you
LUK.22.34	And he said, I tell you
LUK.22.35	And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked you
LUK.22.36	Then said he unto them, But now, he that has a purse, let him take 
LUK.22.37	For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.
LUK.22.38	And they said, Lord - Kurios, behold, here 
LUK.22.39	And he came out, and went, as he was wont 
LUK.22.40	And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that you
LUK.22.41	And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,
LUK.22.42	Saying, Father, if you
LUK.22.43	And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.
LUK.22.44	And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
LUK.22.45	And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,
LUK.22.46	And said unto them, Why sleep you
LUK.22.47	And while he yet spoke, behold a multitude, and he that was called Y’hudah 
LUK.22.48	But Yeshua 
LUK.22.49	When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord - Kurios, shall we strike with the sword?
LUK.22.50	And one of them struck the slave of the High Priest, and cut off his right ear.
LUK.22.51	And Yeshua 
LUK.22.52	Then Yeshua 
LUK.22.53	When I was daily with you in the temple, you
LUK.22.54	Then took they him, and led 
LUK.22.55	And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Kefa 
LUK.22.56	But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.
LUK.22.57	And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.
LUK.22.58	And after a little while another saw him, and said, you
LUK.22.59	And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a tthis 
LUK.22.60	And Kefa 
LUK.22.61	And the Lord - Kurios turned, and looked upon Kefa 
LUK.22.62	And Kefa 
LUK.22.63	And the men that held Yeshua 
LUK.22.64	And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that struck you
LUK.22.65	And many other things blasphemously spoke they against him.
LUK.22.66	And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the Torah-teachers 
LUK.22.67	Are you
LUK.22.68	And if I also ask 
LUK.22.69	Hereafter shall the Son of Man sit on the right hand of the power of God-Theos.
LUK.22.70	Then said they all, Are you
LUK.22.71	And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.
LUK.23.1	And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate 
LUK.23.2	And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this 
LUK.23.3	And Pilate 
LUK.23.4	Then said Pilate 
LUK.23.5	And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galil 
LUK.23.6	When Pilate 
LUK.23.7	And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod 
LUK.23.8	And when Herod 
LUK.23.9	Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
LUK.23.10	And the chief priests and Torah-teachers 
LUK.23.11	And Herod 
LUK.23.12	And the same day Pilate 
LUK.23.13	And Pilate 
LUK.23.14	Said unto them, You
LUK.23.15	No, nor yet Herod 
LUK.23.16	I will therefore chastise him, and release 
LUK.23.17	(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
LUK.23.18	And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this 
LUK.23.19	(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)
LUK.23.20	Pilate 
LUK.23.21	But they cried, saying, Crucify 
LUK.23.22	And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil has he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let 
LUK.23.23	And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.
LUK.23.24	And Pilate 
LUK.23.25	And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Yeshua 
LUK.23.26	And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Shim’on 
LUK.23.27	And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.
LUK.23.28	But Yeshua 
LUK.23.29	For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed 
LUK.23.30	Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
LUK.23.31	For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
LUK.23.32	And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.
LUK.23.33	And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
LUK.23.34	Then said Yeshua 
LUK.23.35	And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided 
LUK.23.36	And the soldiers also deceived him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,
LUK.23.37	And saying, If you
LUK.23.38	And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek [unstable: the miry one], and Latin, and ‘Evri’ot 
LUK.23.39	And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If you
LUK.23.40	But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Do not you
LUK.23.41	And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man has done nothing amiss.
LUK.23.42	And he said unto Yeshua 
LUK.23.43	And Yeshua 
LUK.23.44	And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
LUK.23.45	And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
LUK.23.46	And when Yeshua 
LUK.23.47	Now when the Centurion 
LUK.23.48	And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, struck their breasts, and returned.
LUK.23.49	And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galil 
LUK.23.50	And, behold, 
LUK.23.52	This 
LUK.23.53	And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was cut in stone, wherein never man before was laid.
LUK.23.54	And that day was the preparation, and the Shabbat 
LUK.23.55	And the women also, which came with him from Galil 
LUK.23.56	And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the Shabbat 
LUK.24.1	Now upon the first 
LUK.24.2	And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
LUK.24.3	And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord - Kurios 
LUK.24.4	And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:
LUK.24.5	And as they were afraid, and bowed down 
LUK.24.6	He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spoke unto you when he was yet in Galil 
LUK.24.7	Saying, The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.
LUK.24.8	And they remembered his words,
LUK.24.9	And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.
LUK.24.10	It was Miryam 
LUK.24.11	And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.
LUK.24.12	Then arose Kefa 
LUK.24.13	And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Yerushalayim 
LUK.24.14	And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
LUK.24.15	And it came to pass, that, while they communed 
LUK.24.16	But their eyes were held that they should not know him.
LUK.24.17	And he said unto them, What manner of communications 
LUK.24.18	And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Are you
LUK.24.19	And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Yeshua 
LUK.24.20	And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.
LUK.24.21	But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Yisra’el 
LUK.24.22	Yes, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;
LUK.24.23	And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.
LUK.24.24	And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found 
LUK.24.25	Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:
LUK.24.26	Ought not Moshiach 
LUK.24.27	And beginning at Moshe 
LUK.24.28	And they drew near unto the village, to which they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.
LUK.24.29	But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to wait with them.
LUK.24.30	And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and Blessed 
LUK.24.31	And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.
LUK.24.32	And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?
LUK.24.33	And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Yerushalayim 
LUK.24.34	Saying, The Lord - Kurios is risen indeed, and has appeared to Shim’on 
LUK.24.35	And they told what things 
LUK.24.36	And as they thus spoke, Yeshua 
LUK.24.37	But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a Spirit 
LUK.24.38	And he said unto them, Why are you
LUK.24.39	Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a Spirit 
LUK.24.40	And when he had thus spoken, he showed them 
LUK.24.41	And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have you
LUK.24.42	And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.
LUK.24.43	And he took 
LUK.24.44	And he said unto them, These 
LUK.24.45	Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,
LUK.24.46	And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Moshiach 
LUK.24.47	And that repentance and forgiveness 
LUK.24.48	And you
LUK.24.49	And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but wait you
LUK.24.50	And he led them out as far as to Beit-Anyah 
LUK.24.51	And it came to pass, while he Blessed 
LUK.24.52	And they worshipped him, and returned to Yerushalayim 
LUK.24.53	And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God-Theos. Amen.
JHN.1.1	In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God-Theos, and the Word was God-Theos.
JHN.1.2	The same was in the beginning with God-Theos.
JHN.1.3	All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
JHN.1.4	In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
JHN.1.5	And the light shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.
JHN.1.6	There was a man sent from God-Theos, whose name 
JHN.1.7	The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all 
JHN.1.8	He was not that Light, but 
JHN.1.10	He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
JHN.1.11	He came unto his own, and his own received him not.
JHN.1.12	But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God-Theos, 
JHN.1.13	Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God-Theos.
JHN.1.14	And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, 
JHN.1.15	Yochanan 
JHN.1.16	And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.
JHN.1.17	For the law was given through Moshe 
JHN.1.18	No man has seen God-Theos at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared 
JHN.1.19	And this is the record of Yochanan 
JHN.1.20	And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Moshiach 
JHN.1.21	And they asked him, What then? Are you
JHN.1.22	Then said they unto him, Who are you
JHN.1.23	He said, I 
JHN.1.24	And they which were sent were of the P’rushim (Pharisee 
JHN.1.25	And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptize you
JHN.1.26	Yochanan 
JHN.1.27	He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s sandal lace I am not worthy to unloose.
JHN.1.28	These things were done in Bet-Abara 
JHN.1.29	The next day Yochanan 
JHN.1.30	This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.
JHN.1.31	And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Yisra’el 
JHN.1.32	And Yochanan 
JHN.1.33	And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize in water, the same said unto me, Upon whom you
JHN.1.34	And I saw, and bore record that this is the Son of God-Theos.
JHN.1.35	Again the next day after Yochanan 
JHN.1.36	And looking upon Yeshua 
JHN.1.37	And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Yeshua 
JHN.1.38	Then Yeshua 
JHN.1.39	He says unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.
JHN.1.40	One of the two which heard Yochanan 
JHN.1.41	He first finds his own brother Shim’on 
JHN.1.42	And he brought him to Yeshua 
JHN.1.43	The day following Yeshua 
JHN.1.44	Now Philip 
JHN.1.45	Philip 
JHN.1.46	And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Natzeret 
JHN.1.47	Yeshua 
JHN.1.48	Nathanael says unto him, Whence know you
JHN.1.49	Nathanael answered and says unto him, Rabbi, you
JHN.1.50	Yeshua 
JHN.1.51	And he says unto him, Truly, truly, I say unto you, Hereafter you
JHN.2.1	And the third day there was a marriage in Kanah 
JHN.2.2	And both Yeshua 
JHN.2.3	And when they wanted wine, the mother of Yeshua 
JHN.2.4	Yeshua 
JHN.2.5	His mother says unto the servants, Whatsoever he says unto you, do 
JHN.2.6	And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Y’hudim 
JHN.2.7	Yeshua 
JHN.2.8	And he says unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bore 
JHN.2.9	When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not from what place it was: 
JHN.2.10	And says unto him, Every man at the beginning does set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: 
JHN.2.11	This beginning of miracles did Yeshua 
JHN.2.12	After this he went down to K’far-Nachum 
JHN.2.13	And the Y’hudit 
JHN.2.14	And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:
JHN.2.15	And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables;
JHN.2.16	And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise.
JHN.2.17	And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of your
JHN.2.18	Then answered the Y’hudim 
JHN.2.19	Yeshua 
JHN.2.20	Then said the Y’hudim 
JHN.2.21	But he spoke of the temple of his body.
JHN.2.22	When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Yeshua 
JHN.2.23	Now when he was in Yerushalayim 
JHN.2.24	But Yeshua 
JHN.2.25	And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.
JHN.3.1	There was a man of the P’rushim 
JHN.3.2	The same came to Yeshua 
JHN.3.3	Yeshua 
JHN.3.4	Nicodemus says unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?
JHN.3.5	Yeshua 
JHN.3.6	That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit 
JHN.3.7	Marvel not that I said unto you
JHN.3.8	The wind blows where it lists, and you
JHN.3.9	Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?
JHN.3.10	Yeshua 
JHN.3.11	Truly, truly, I say unto you
JHN.3.12	If I have told you earthly things, and you
JHN.3.13	And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, 
JHN.3.14	And as Moshe 
JHN.3.15	That whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
JHN.3.16	For God-The Father so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
JHN.3.17	For God-The Father sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
JHN.3.18	He that believes on him is not condemned: but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God-The Father.
JHN.3.19	And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
JHN.3.20	For every one that does evil hates the light, neither comes to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.
JHN.3.21	But he that does tcomes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God-The Father.
JHN.3.22	After these things came Yeshua 
JHN.3.23	And Yochanan 
JHN.3.24	For Yochanan 
JHN.3.25	Then there arose a question between 
JHN.3.26	And they came unto Yochanan 
JHN.3.27	Yochanan 
JHN.3.28	You
JHN.3.29	He that has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.
JHN.3.30	He must increase, but I 
JHN.3.31	He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he that comes from heaven is above all.
JHN.3.32	And what he has seen and heard, that he testifies; and no man receives his testimony.
JHN.3.33	He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God-The Father is true.
JHN.3.34	For he whom God-The Father has sent speaks the words of God-The Father: for God-The Father gives not the Spirit 
JHN.3.35	The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.
JHN.3.36	He that believes on the Son has everlasting life: and he that believes not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God-The Father abides on him.
JHN.4.1	When therefore the Lord - Kurios knew how the P’rushim 
JHN.4.2	(Though Yeshua 
JHN.4.3	He left Y’hudah 
JHN.4.4	And he must needs go through Shomron 
JHN.4.5	Then comes he to a city of Shomron 
JHN.4.6	Now Ya’akov 
JHN.4.7	There comes a woman of Shomron 
JHN.4.8	(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)
JHN.4.9	Then says the woman of Shomron 
JHN.4.10	Yeshua 
JHN.4.11	The woman says unto him, Sir, you
JHN.4.12	Are you
JHN.4.13	Yeshua 
JHN.4.14	But whosoever drink of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
JHN.4.15	The woman says unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come here to draw.
JHN.4.16	Yeshua 
JHN.4.17	The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Yeshua 
JHN.4.18	For you
JHN.4.19	The woman says unto him, Sir, I perceive that you
JHN.4.20	Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and you
JHN.4.21	Yeshua 
JHN.4.22	You
JHN.4.23	But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in Spirit 
JHN.4.24	God-The Father 
JHN.4.25	The woman says unto him, I know that Messiah comes, which is called Moshiach 
JHN.4.26	Yeshua 
JHN.4.27	And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seek you
JHN.4.28	The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and says to the men,
JHN.4.29	Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Moshiach 
JHN.4.30	Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.
JHN.4.31	In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.
JHN.4.32	But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that you
JHN.4.33	Therefore said the disciples one to another, Has any man brought him 
JHN.4.34	Yeshua 
JHN.4.35	Say not you
JHN.4.36	And he that reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit unto life eternal: that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together.
JHN.4.37	And herein is that saying true, One sows, and another reaps.
JHN.4.38	I sent you to reap that whereon you
JHN.4.39	And many of the Shomronim 
JHN.4.40	So when the Shomronim 
JHN.4.41	And many more believed because of his own word;
JHN.4.42	And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of you
JHN.4.43	Now after two days he departed there, and went into Galil 
JHN.4.44	For Yeshua 
JHN.4.45	Then when he was come into Galil 
JHN.4.46	So Yeshua 
JHN.4.47	When he heard that Yeshua 
JHN.4.48	Then said Yeshua 
JHN.4.49	The nobleman says unto him, Sir, come down before my child die.
JHN.4.50	Yeshua 
JHN.4.51	And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told 
JHN.4.52	Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
JHN.4.53	So the father knew that 
JHN.4.54	This 
JHN.5.1	After this there was a feast of the Y’hudim 
JHN.5.2	Now there is at Yerushalayim 
JHN.5.3	In these lay a great multitude of impotent 
JHN.5.4	For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.
JHN.5.5	And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.
JHN.5.6	When Yeshua 
JHN.5.7	The impotent 
JHN.5.8	Yeshua 
JHN.5.9	And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the Shabbat 
JHN.5.10	The Y’hudim 
JHN.5.11	He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up your
JHN.5.12	Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto you
JHN.5.13	And he that was healed did not know not who it was: for Yeshua 
JHN.5.14	Afterward Yeshua 
JHN.5.15	The man departed, and told the Y’hudim 
JHN.5.16	And therefore did the Y’hudim 
JHN.5.17	But Yeshua 
JHN.5.18	Therefore the Y’hudim 
JHN.5.19	Then answered Yeshua 
JHN.5.20	For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that himself does: and he will show him greater works than these, that you
JHN.5.21	For as the Father raises up the dead, and quickens 
JHN.5.22	For the Father no man, but has committed all judgment unto the Son:
JHN.5.23	That all 
JHN.5.24	Truly, truly, I say unto you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.
JHN.5.25	Truly, truly, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God-The Father: and they that hear shall live.
JHN.5.26	For as the Father has life in himself; so has he given to the Son to have life in himself;
JHN.5.27	And has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of Man.
JHN.5.28	Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
JHN.5.29	And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.
JHN.5.30	I can of my own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father which has sent me.
JHN.5.31	If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
JHN.5.32	There is another that bears witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true.
JHN.5.33	You
JHN.5.34	But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that you
JHN.5.35	He was a burning and a shining light: and you
JHN.5.36	But I have greater witness than 
JHN.5.37	And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me. You
JHN.5.38	And you
JHN.5.39	Search the scriptures; for in them you
JHN.5.40	And you
JHN.5.41	I receive not honour from men.
JHN.5.42	But I know you, that you
JHN.5.43	I am come in my Father’s name, and you
JHN.5.44	How can you
JHN.5.45	Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is 
JHN.5.46	For had you
JHN.5.47	But if you
JHN.6.1	After these things Yeshua 
JHN.6.2	And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.
JHN.6.3	And Yeshua 
JHN.6.4	And the Passover, a feast of the Y’hudim 
JHN.6.5	When Yeshua 
JHN.6.6	And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.
JHN.6.7	Philip 
JHN.6.8	One of his disciples, Andrew 
JHN.6.9	There is a boy here, which has five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?
JHN.6.10	And Yeshua 
JHN.6.11	And Yeshua 
JHN.6.12	When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.
JHN.6.13	Therefore they gathered 
JHN.6.14	Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Yeshua 
JHN.6.15	When Yeshua 
JHN.6.16	And when even was 
JHN.6.17	And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward K’far-Nachum 
JHN.6.18	And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.
JHN.6.19	So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Yeshua 
JHN.6.20	But he says unto them, It is I; be not afraid.
JHN.6.21	Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land to which they went.
JHN.6.22	The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Yeshua 
JHN.6.23	(However there came other boats from Tiberias 
JHN.6.24	When the people therefore saw that Yeshua 
JHN.6.25	And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when came you
JHN.6.26	Yeshua 
JHN.6.27	Labour not for the meat which perishes, but for that meat which endures unto everlasting life, which the Son of Man shall give unto you: for him has God-The Father the Father sealed.
JHN.6.28	Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God-The Father?
JHN.6.29	Yeshua 
JHN.6.30	They said therefore unto him, What sign shows you
JHN.6.31	Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
JHN.6.32	Then Yeshua 
JHN.6.33	For the bread of God-The Father is he which comes down from heaven, and gives life unto the world.
JHN.6.34	Then said they unto him, Lord - Kurios, evermore give us this bread.
JHN.6.35	And Yeshua 
JHN.6.36	But I said unto you, That you
JHN.6.37	All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and him that comes to me I will assuredly not 
JHN.6.38	For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.
JHN.6.39	And this is the Father’s will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.
JHN.6.40	And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which sees the Son, and believes on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.
JHN.6.41	The Y’hudim 
JHN.6.42	And they said, Is not this Yeshua 
JHN.6.43	Yeshua 
JHN.6.44	No man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.
JHN.6.45	It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God-The Father. Every man therefore that has heard, and has learned of the Father, comes unto me.
JHN.6.46	Not that any man has seen the Father, save he which is of God-The Father, he has seen the Father.
JHN.6.47	Truly, truly, I say unto you, He that believes on me has everlasting life.
JHN.6.48	I am that bread of life.
JHN.6.49	Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.
JHN.6.50	This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.
JHN.6.51	I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
JHN.6.52	The Y’hudim 
JHN.6.53	Then Yeshua 
JHN.6.54	Whoso eats my flesh, and drink my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
JHN.6.55	For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
JHN.6.56	He that eats my flesh, and drink my blood, dwells in me, and I in him.
JHN.6.57	As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eats me, even he shall live by me.
JHN.6.58	This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eats of this bread shall live forever.
JHN.6.59	These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in K’far-Nachum 
JHN.6.60	Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard 
JHN.6.61	When Yeshua 
JHN.6.63	It is the Spirit 
JHN.6.64	But there are some of you that believe not. For Yeshua 
JHN.6.65	And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.
JHN.6.66	From that 
JHN.6.67	Then said Yeshua 
JHN.6.68	Then Shim’on 
JHN.6.69	And we believe and are sure that you
JHN.6.70	Yeshua 
JHN.6.71	He spoke of Y’hudah 
JHN.7.1	After these things Yeshua 
JHN.7.2	Now the Y’hudit (Y’hudim 
JHN.7.3	His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Y’hudah 
JHN.7.4	For 
JHN.7.5	For neither did his brethren believe in him.
JHN.7.6	Then Yeshua 
JHN.7.7	The world cannot hate you; but me it hates, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.
JHN.7.8	Go you
JHN.7.9	When he had said these words unto them, he abode 
JHN.7.10	But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.
JHN.7.11	Then the Y’hudim 
JHN.7.12	And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, No; but he deceives the people.
JHN.7.13	However no man spoke openly of him for fear of the Y’hudim 
JHN.7.14	Now about the midst of the feast Yeshua 
JHN.7.15	And the Y’hudim 
JHN.7.16	Yeshua 
JHN.7.17	If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God-The Father, or 
JHN.7.18	He that speaks of himself seeks his own glory: but he that seeks his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
JHN.7.19	Did not Moshe 
JHN.7.20	The people answered and said, you
JHN.7.21	Yeshua 
JHN.7.22	Moshe 
JHN.7.23	If a man on the Shabbat 
JHN.7.24	Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
JHN.7.25	Then said some of them of Yerushalayim 
JHN.7.26	But, lo, he speaks boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Moshiach 
JHN.7.27	However we know this man from what place he is: but when Moshiach 
JHN.7.28	Then cried Yeshua 
JHN.7.29	But I know him: for I am from him, and he has sent me.
JHN.7.30	Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
JHN.7.31	And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Moshiach 
JHN.7.32	The P’rushim 
JHN.7.33	Then said Yeshua 
JHN.7.34	You
JHN.7.35	Then said the Y’hudim 
JHN.7.36	What 
JHN.7.37	In the last day, that great 
JHN.7.38	He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.
JHN.7.39	(But this spoke he of the Spirit 
JHN.7.40	Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a tthis is the Prophet.
JHN.7.41	Others said, This is the Moshiach 
JHN.7.42	Has not the scripture said, That Moshiach 
JHN.7.43	So there was a division among the people because of him.
JHN.7.44	And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
JHN.7.45	Then came the officers to the chief priests and P’rushim 
JHN.7.46	The officers answered, Never man spoke like this man.
JHN.7.47	Then answered them the P’rushim (Pharisee 
JHN.7.48	Have any of the rulers or of the P’rushim 
JHN.7.49	But this people who knows not the law are cursed.
JHN.7.50	Nicodemus says unto them, (he that came to Yeshua 
JHN.7.51	Does our law judge 
JHN.7.52	They answered and said unto him, Are you
JHN.7.53	And every man went unto his own house.
JHN.8.1	Yeshua 
JHN.8.2	And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.
JHN.8.3	And the Torah-teachers 
JHN.8.4	They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.
JHN.8.5	Now Moshe 
JHN.8.6	This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Yeshua 
JHN.8.7	So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.
JHN.8.8	And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
JHN.8.9	And they which heard 
JHN.8.10	When Yeshua 
JHN.8.11	She said, No man, Lord - Kurios. And Yeshua 
JHN.8.12	Then spoke Yeshua 
JHN.8.13	The P’rushim 
JHN.8.14	Yeshua 
JHN.8.15	You
JHN.8.16	And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.
JHN.8.17	It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.
JHN.8.18	I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me bears witness of me.
JHN.8.19	Then said they unto him, Where is your
JHN.8.20	These words spoke Yeshua 
JHN.8.21	Then said Yeshua 
JHN.8.22	Then said the Y’hudim 
JHN.8.23	And he said unto them, You
JHN.8.24	I said therefore unto you, that you
JHN.8.25	Then said they unto him, Who are you
JHN.8.26	I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.
JHN.8.27	They understood not that he spoke to them of the Father.
JHN.8.28	Then said Yeshua 
JHN.8.29	And he that sent me is with me: the Father has not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.
JHN.8.30	As he spoke these words, many believed on him.
JHN.8.31	Then said Yeshua 
JHN.8.32	And you
JHN.8.33	They answered him, We be Avraham 
JHN.8.34	Yeshua 
JHN.8.35	And the slave abides not in the house forever: 
JHN.8.36	If the Son therefore shall make you free, you
JHN.8.37	I know that you
JHN.8.38	I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you
JHN.8.39	They answered and said unto him, Avraham 
JHN.8.40	But now you
JHN.8.41	You
JHN.8.42	Yeshua 
JHN.8.43	Why do you
JHN.8.44	You
JHN.8.45	And because I tell 
JHN.8.46	Which of you convinces me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do you
JHN.8.47	He that is of God-The Father hears God-The Father’s words: you
JHN.8.48	Then answered the Y’hudim 
JHN.8.49	Yeshua 
JHN.8.50	And I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeks and judges.
JHN.8.51	Truly, truly, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.
JHN.8.52	Then said the Y’hudim 
JHN.8.53	Are you
JHN.8.54	Yeshua 
JHN.8.55	Yet you
JHN.8.56	Your father Avraham 
JHN.8.57	Then said the Y’hudim 
JHN.8.58	Yeshua 
JHN.8.59	Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Yeshua 
JHN.9.1	And as [Yeshua 
JHN.9.2	And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
JHN.9.3	Yeshua 
JHN.9.4	I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night comes, when no man can work.
JHN.9.5	As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
JHN.9.6	When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,
JHN.9.7	And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, 
JHN.9.8	The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?
JHN.9.9	Some said, This is he: others 
JHN.9.10	Therefore said they unto him, How were you
JHN.9.11	He answered and said, A man that is called Yeshua 
JHN.9.12	Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.
JHN.9.13	They brought to the P’rushim 
JHN.9.14	And it was the Shabbat 
JHN.9.15	Then again the P’rushim 
JHN.9.16	Therefore said some of the P’rushim (Pharisee 
JHN.9.17	They say unto the blind man again, What say you
JHN.9.18	But the Y’hudim 
JHN.9.19	And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who you
JHN.9.20	His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
JHN.9.21	But by what means he now sees, we know not; or who has opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.
JHN.9.22	These 
JHN.9.23	Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
JHN.9.24	Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God-The Father the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.
JHN.9.25	He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner 
JHN.9.26	Then said they to him again, What did he to you
JHN.9.27	He answered them, I have told you already, and you
JHN.9.28	Then they reviled him, and said, you
JHN.9.29	We know that God-The Father spoke unto Moshe 
JHN.9.30	The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that you
JHN.9.31	Now we know that God-The Father hears not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God-The Father, and does his will, him he hears.
JHN.9.32	Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.
JHN.9.33	If this man were not of God-The Father, he could do nothing.
JHN.9.34	They answered and said unto him, you
JHN.9.35	Yeshua 
JHN.9.36	He answered and said, Who is he, Lord - Kurios, that I might believe on him?
JHN.9.37	And Yeshua 
JHN.9.38	And he said, Lord - Kurios, I believe. And he worshipped him.
JHN.9.39	And Yeshua 
JHN.9.40	And 
JHN.9.41	Yeshua 
JHN.10.1	Truly, truly, I say unto you, He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.
JHN.10.2	But he that enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
JHN.10.3	To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.
JHN.10.4	And when he puts forth his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.
JHN.10.5	And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.
JHN.10.6	This parable spoke Yeshua 
JHN.10.7	Then said Yeshua 
JHN.10.8	All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.
JHN.10.9	I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
JHN.10.10	The thief comes not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have 
JHN.10.11	I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.
JHN.10.12	But he that is an employee 
JHN.10.13	The employee 
JHN.10.14	I am the good shepherd, and know my 
JHN.10.15	As the Father knows me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.
JHN.10.16	And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, 
JHN.10.17	Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.
JHN.10.18	No man takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.
JHN.10.19	There was a division therefore again among the Y’hudim 
JHN.10.20	And many of them said, He has a devil, and is mad; why hear you
JHN.10.21	Others said, These are not the words of him that has a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?
JHN.10.22	And it was at Yerushalayim 
JHN.10.23	And Yeshua 
JHN.10.24	Then came the Y’hudim 
JHN.10.25	Yeshua 
JHN.10.26	But you
JHN.10.27	My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
JHN.10.28	And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any 
JHN.10.29	My Father, which gave 
JHN.10.30	I and 
JHN.10.31	Then the Y’hudim 
JHN.10.32	Yeshua 
JHN.10.33	The Y’hudim 
JHN.10.34	Yeshua 
JHN.10.35	If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God-The Father came, and the scripture cannot be broken;
JHN.10.36	Say you
JHN.10.37	If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
JHN.10.38	But if I do, though you
JHN.10.39	Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,
JHN.10.40	And went away again beyond Yarden 
JHN.10.41	And many resorted unto him, and said, Yochanan 
JHN.10.42	And many believed on him there.
JHN.11.1	Now a certain 
JHN.11.2	(It was 
JHN.11.3	Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord - Kurios, behold, he whom you
JHN.11.4	When Yeshua 
JHN.11.5	Now Yeshua 
JHN.11.6	When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.
JHN.11.7	Then after that says he to 
JHN.11.9	Yeshua 
JHN.11.10	But if a man walk in the night, he stumbles, because there is no light in him.
JHN.11.11	These things said he: and after that he says unto them, Our friend El’azar 
JHN.11.12	Then said his disciples, Lord - Kurios, if he sleep, he shall do well.
JHN.11.13	However Yeshua 
JHN.11.14	Then said Yeshua 
JHN.11.15	And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent you
JHN.11.16	Then said T’oma 
JHN.11.17	Then when Yeshua 
JHN.11.18	Now Beit-Anyah 
JHN.11.19	And many of the Y’hudim 
JHN.11.20	Then Marta 
JHN.11.21	Then said Marta 
JHN.11.22	But I know, that even now, whatsoever you
JHN.11.23	Yeshua 
JHN.11.24	Marta 
JHN.11.25	Yeshua 
JHN.11.26	And whosoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Believe you
JHN.11.27	She says unto him, Yes, Lord - Kurios: I believe that you
JHN.11.28	And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Miryam 
JHN.11.29	As soon as she heard 
JHN.11.30	Now Yeshua 
JHN.11.31	The Y’hudim 
JHN.11.32	Then when Miryam 
JHN.11.33	When Yeshua 
JHN.11.34	And said, Where have you
JHN.11.35	Yeshua 
JHN.11.36	Then said the Y’hudim 
JHN.11.37	And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?
JHN.11.38	Yeshua 
JHN.11.39	Yeshua 
JHN.11.40	Yeshua 
JHN.11.41	Then they took away the stone 
JHN.11.42	And I knew that you
JHN.11.43	And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, El’azar 
JHN.11.44	And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Yeshua 
JHN.11.45	Then many of the Y’hudim 
JHN.11.46	But some of them went their ways to the P’rushim (Pharisee 
JHN.11.47	Then gathered the chief priests and the P’rushim 
JHN.11.48	If we let him thus alone, all 
JHN.11.49	And one of them, 
JHN.11.50	Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.
JHN.11.51	And this spoke he not of himself: but being High Priest that year, he prophesied that Yeshua 
JHN.11.52	And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God-The Father that were scattered abroad.
JHN.11.53	Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.
JHN.11.54	Yeshua 
JHN.11.55	And the Y’hudit (Y’hudim 
JHN.11.56	Then sought they for Yeshua 
JHN.11.57	Now both the chief priests and the P’rushim 
JHN.12.1	Then Yeshua 
JHN.12.2	There they made him a supper; and Marta 
JHN.12.3	Then took Miryam 
JHN.12.4	Then says one of his disciples, Y’hudah 
JHN.12.5	Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?
JHN.12.6	This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bore what was put in it.
JHN.12.7	Then said Yeshua 
JHN.12.8	For the poor always you
JHN.12.9	Much people of the Y’hudim 
JHN.12.10	But the chief priests consulted that they might put El’azar 
JHN.12.11	Because that by reason of him many of the Y’hudim 
JHN.12.12	On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Yeshua 
JHN.12.13	Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed 
JHN.12.14	And Yeshua 
JHN.12.15	Fear not, daughter of Tziyon 
JHN.12.16	These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Yeshua 
JHN.12.17	The people therefore that was with him when he called El’azar 
JHN.12.18	For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.
JHN.12.19	The P’rushim 
JHN.12.20	And there were certain Greeks 
JHN.12.21	The same came therefore to Philip 
JHN.12.22	Philip 
JHN.12.23	And Yeshua 
JHN.12.24	Truly, truly, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abides alone: but if it die, it brings forth much fruit.
JHN.12.25	He that loves his life shall lose it; and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.
JHN.12.26	If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my slave be: if any man serve me, him will 
JHN.12.27	Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.
JHN.12.28	Father, glorify your
JHN.12.29	The people therefore, that stood by, and heard 
JHN.12.30	Yeshua 
JHN.12.31	Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
JHN.12.32	And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all 
JHN.12.33	This he said, signifying what death he should die.
JHN.12.34	The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Moshiach 
JHN.12.35	Then Yeshua 
JHN.12.36	While you
JHN.12.37	But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:
JHN.12.38	That the saying of Yesha’yahu 
JHN.12.39	Therefore they could not believe, because that Yesha’yahu 
JHN.12.40	He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with 
JHN.12.41	These things said Yesha’yahu 
JHN.12.42	Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the P’rushim 
JHN.12.43	For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God-The Father.
JHN.12.44	Yeshua 
JHN.12.45	And he that sees me sees him that sent me.
JHN.12.46	I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believes on me should not abide in darkness.
JHN.12.47	And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
JHN.12.48	He that rejects me, and receives not my words, has one that him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.
JHN.12.49	For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.
JHN.12.50	And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.
JHN.13.1	Now before the feast of the Passover, when Yeshua 
JHN.13.2	And supper during supper, the devil having now put into the heart of Y’hudah 
JHN.13.3	Yeshua 
JHN.13.4	He rises from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.
JHN.13.5	After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe 
JHN.13.6	Then comes he to Shim’on 
JHN.13.7	Yeshua 
JHN.13.8	Kefa 
JHN.13.9	Shim’on 
JHN.13.10	Yeshua 
JHN.13.11	For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, You
JHN.13.12	So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know you
JHN.13.13	You
JHN.13.14	If I then, 
JHN.13.15	For I have given you an example, that you
JHN.13.16	Truly, truly, I say unto you, The slave is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.
JHN.13.17	If you
JHN.13.18	I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.
JHN.13.19	Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, you
JHN.13.20	Truly, truly, I say unto you, He that receives whomsoever I send receives me; and he that receives me receives him that sent me.
JHN.13.21	When Yeshua 
JHN.13.22	Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spoke.
JHN.13.23	Now there was leaning on Yeshua 
JHN.13.24	Shim’on 
JHN.13.25	He then lying on Yeshua 
JHN.13.26	Yeshua 
JHN.13.27	And after the sop 
JHN.13.28	Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spoke this unto him.
JHN.13.29	For some 
JHN.13.30	He then having received the sop 
JHN.13.31	Therefore, when he was gone out, Yeshua 
JHN.13.32	If God-The Father be glorified in him, God-The Father shall also glorify him in himself, and shall immediately glorify him.
JHN.13.33	Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You
JHN.13.34	A new commandment I give unto you, That you
JHN.13.35	By this shall all 
JHN.13.36	Shim’on 
JHN.13.37	Kefa 
JHN.13.38	Yeshua 
JHN.14.1	Let not your heart be troubled: you
JHN.14.2	In my Father’s house are many offices: if 
JHN.14.3	And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, 
JHN.14.4	And to which I go you
JHN.14.5	T’oma 
JHN.14.6	Yeshua 
JHN.14.7	If you
JHN.14.8	Philip 
JHN.14.9	Yeshua 
JHN.14.10	Believe you
JHN.14.11	Believe me that I 
JHN.14.12	Truly, truly, I say unto you, He that believes on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater 
JHN.14.13	And whatsoever you
JHN.14.14	If you
JHN.14.15	If you
JHN.14.16	And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever;
JHN.14.18	I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.
JHN.14.19	Yet a little while, and the world sees me no more; but you
JHN.14.20	At that day you
JHN.14.21	He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me: and he that loves me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
JHN.14.22	Y’hudah 
JHN.14.23	Yeshua 
JHN.14.24	He that loves me not keeps not my sayings: and the word which you
JHN.14.25	These things have I spoken unto you, being 
JHN.14.26	But the Comforter, 
JHN.14.27	Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world gives, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
JHN.14.28	You
JHN.14.29	And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, you
JHN.14.30	Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.
JHN.14.31	But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.
JHN.15.1	I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer 
JHN.15.2	Every branch in me that bears not fruit he takes away: and every 
JHN.15.3	Now you
JHN.15.4	Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can you
JHN.15.5	I am the vine, you
JHN.15.6	If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast 
JHN.15.7	If you
JHN.15.8	Herein is my Father glorified, that you
JHN.15.9	As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you: continue you
JHN.15.10	If you
JHN.15.11	These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and 
JHN.15.12	This is my commandment, That you
JHN.15.13	Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
JHN.15.14	You
JHN.15.15	From this time forth 
JHN.15.16	You
JHN.15.17	These things I command you, that you
JHN.15.18	If the world hate you, you
JHN.15.19	If you
JHN.15.20	Remember the word that I said unto you, The slave is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.
JHN.15.21	But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me.
JHN.15.22	If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.
JHN.15.23	He that hates me hates my Father also.
JHN.15.24	If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.
JHN.15.25	But 
JHN.15.26	But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, 
JHN.15.27	And you
JHN.16.1	These things have I spoken unto you, that you
JHN.16.2	They shall put you out of the synagogues: yes, the time comes, that whosoever kills you will think that he does God-The Father service.
JHN.16.3	And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.
JHN.16.4	But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, you
JHN.16.5	But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asks me, Where go you
JHN.16.6	But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow has filled your heart.
JHN.16.7	Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.
JHN.16.8	And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:
JHN.16.9	Of sin, because they believe not on me;
JHN.16.10	Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and you
JHN.16.11	Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.
JHN.16.12	I have yet many things to say unto you, but you
JHN.16.13	However when he, the Spirit 
JHN.16.14	He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of my, and shall show 
JHN.16.15	All things that the Father has are my: therefore said I, that he shall take of my, and shall show 
JHN.16.16	A little while, and you
JHN.16.17	Then said 
JHN.16.18	They said therefore, What is this that he says, A little while? we cannot tell what he says.
JHN.16.19	Now Yeshua 
JHN.16.20	Truly, truly, I say unto you, That you
JHN.16.21	A woman when she is in travail has sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembers no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.
JHN.16.22	And you
JHN.16.23	And in that day you
JHN.16.24	Till this point in time have you
JHN.16.25	These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time comes, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of the Father.
JHN.16.26	At that day you
JHN.16.27	For the Father himself loves you, because you
JHN.16.28	I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.
JHN.16.29	His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speak you
JHN.16.30	Now are we sure that you
JHN.16.31	Yeshua 
JHN.16.32	Behold, the hour comes, yes, is now come, that you
JHN.16.33	These things I have spoken unto you, that in me you
JHN.17.1	These words spoke Yeshua 
JHN.17.2	As you
JHN.17.3	And this is life eternal, that they might know you
JHN.17.4	I have glorified you
JHN.17.5	And now, O Father, glorify you
JHN.17.6	I have manifested your
JHN.17.7	Now they have known that all things whatsoever you
JHN.17.8	For I have given unto them the words which you
JHN.17.9	I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which you
JHN.17.10	And all mine are yoursi, and yoursi are mine; and I am glorified in them.
JHN.17.11	And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to you
JHN.17.12	While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your
JHN.17.13	And now come I to you
JHN.17.14	I have given them your
JHN.17.15	I pray not that you
JHN.17.16	They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
JHN.17.17	Sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) them through your
JHN.17.18	As you
JHN.17.19	And for their sakes I sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.
JHN.17.20	Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;
JHN.17.21	That they all may be one; as you
JHN.17.22	And the glory which you
JHN.17.23	I in them, and you
JHN.17.24	Father, I will that they also, whom you
JHN.17.25	O righteous Father, the world has not known you
JHN.17.26	And I have declared unto them your
JHN.18.1	When Yeshua 
JHN.18.2	And Y’hudah 
JHN.18.3	Y’hudah 
JHN.18.4	Yeshua 
JHN.18.5	They answered him, Yeshua 
JHN.18.6	As soon then as he had said unto them, I am 
JHN.18.7	Then asked he them again, Whom seek you
JHN.18.8	Yeshua 
JHN.18.9	That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Of them which you
JHN.18.10	Then Shim’on 
JHN.18.11	Then said Yeshua 
JHN.18.12	Then the band and the captain and officers of the Y’hudim 
JHN.18.13	And led him away to ‘Anan 
JHN.18.14	Now Kayafa 
JHN.18.15	And Shim’on 
JHN.18.16	But Kefa 
JHN.18.17	Then says the girl that kept the door unto Kefa 
JHN.18.18	And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Kefa 
JHN.18.19	The High Priest then asked Yeshua 
JHN.18.20	Yeshua 
JHN.18.21	Why ask you
JHN.18.22	And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Yeshua 
JHN.18.23	Yeshua 
JHN.18.24	Now ‘Anan 
JHN.18.25	And Shim’on 
JHN.18.26	One of the servants of the High Priest, being 
JHN.18.27	Kefa 
JHN.18.28	Then led they Yeshua 
JHN.18.29	Pilate 
JHN.18.30	They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto you
JHN.18.31	Then said Pilate 
JHN.18.32	That the saying of Yeshua 
JHN.18.33	Then Pilate 
JHN.18.34	Yeshua 
JHN.18.35	Pilate 
JHN.18.36	Yeshua 
JHN.18.37	Pilate 
JHN.18.38	Pilate 
JHN.18.39	But you
JHN.18.40	Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Bar-Abba 
JHN.19.1	Then Pilate 
JHN.19.2	And the soldiers braided a crown of thorns, and put 
JHN.19.3	And said, Hail, King of the Y’hudim 
JHN.19.4	Pilate 
JHN.19.5	Then came Yeshua 
JHN.19.6	When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify 
JHN.19.7	The Y’hudim 
JHN.19.8	When Pilate 
JHN.19.9	And went again into the judgment hall, and says unto Yeshua 
JHN.19.10	Then says Pilate 
JHN.19.11	Yeshua 
JHN.19.12	And from thenceforth Pilate 
JHN.19.13	When Pilate 
JHN.19.14	And it was the preparation of the Passover, and about the sixth hour: and he says unto the Y’hudim 
JHN.19.15	But they cried out, Away with 
JHN.19.16	Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Yeshua 
JHN.19.17	And he bearing his stake 
JHN.19.18	Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Yeshua 
JHN.19.19	And Pilate 
JHN.19.20	This title then read many of the Y’hudim 
JHN.19.21	Then said the chief priests of the Y’hudim 
JHN.19.22	Pilate 
JHN.19.23	Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Yeshua 
JHN.19.24	They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend 
JHN.19.25	Now there stood by the stake 
JHN.19.26	When Yeshua 
JHN.19.27	Then says he to the disciple, Behold your
JHN.19.28	After this, Yeshua 
JHN.19.29	Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put 
JHN.19.30	When Yeshua 
JHN.19.31	The Y’hudim 
JHN.19.32	Then came the soldiers, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.
JHN.19.33	But when they came to Yeshua 
JHN.19.34	But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.
JHN.19.35	And he that saw 
JHN.19.36	For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.
JHN.19.37	And again another scripture says, They shall look on him whom they pierced.
JHN.19.38	And after this Yosef 
JHN.19.39	And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Yeshua 
JHN.19.40	Then took they the body of Yeshua 
JHN.19.41	Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.
JHN.19.42	There laid they Yeshua 
JHN.20.1	The first 
JHN.20.2	Then she runs, and comes to Shim’on 
JHN.20.3	Kefa 
JHN.20.4	So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Kefa 
JHN.20.5	And he stooping down, 
JHN.20.6	Then comes Shim’on 
JHN.20.7	And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.
JHN.20.8	Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.
JHN.20.9	For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.
JHN.20.10	Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.
JHN.20.11	But Miryam 
JHN.20.12	And sees two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Yeshua 
JHN.20.13	And they say unto her, Woman, why weep you
JHN.20.14	And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Yeshua 
JHN.20.15	Yeshua 
JHN.20.16	Yeshua 
JHN.20.17	Yeshua 
JHN.20.18	Miryam 
JHN.20.19	Then the same day at evening, being the first 
JHN.20.20	And when he had so said, he showed unto them 
JHN.20.21	Then said Yeshua 
JHN.20.22	And when he had said this, he breathed on 
JHN.20.23	Whose soever sins you
JHN.20.24	But T’oma 
JHN.20.25	The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord - Kurios. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.
JHN.20.26	And after eight days again his disciples were within, and T’oma 
JHN.20.27	Then says he to T’oma 
JHN.20.28	And T’oma 
JHN.20.29	Yeshua 
JHN.20.30	And many other signs truly did Yeshua 
JHN.20.31	But these are written, that you
JHN.21.1	After these things Yeshua 
JHN.21.2	There were together Shim’on 
JHN.21.3	Shim’on 
JHN.21.4	But when the morning was now come, Yeshua 
JHN.21.5	Then Yeshua 
JHN.21.6	And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and you
JHN.21.7	Therefore that disciple whom Yeshua 
JHN.21.8	And the other disciples came in a little ship; 
JHN.21.9	As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.
JHN.21.10	Yeshua 
JHN.21.11	Shim’on 
JHN.21.12	Yeshua 
JHN.21.13	Yeshua 
JHN.21.14	This is now the third time that Yeshua 
JHN.21.15	So when they had dined, Yeshua 
JHN.21.16	He says to him again the second time, Shim’on 
JHN.21.17	He says unto him the third time, Shim’on 
JHN.21.18	Truly, truly, I say unto you
JHN.21.19	This spoke he, signifying by what death he should glorify God-The Father. And when he had spoken this, he says unto him, Follow me.
JHN.21.20	Then Kefa 
JHN.21.21	Kefa 
JHN.21.22	Yeshua 
JHN.21.23	Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Yeshua 
JHN.21.24	This is the disciple which testifies of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.
JHN.21.25	And there are also many other things which Yeshua 
ACT.1.1	The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus 
ACT.1.2	Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit 
ACT.1.3	To whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God-The Father:
ACT.1.4	And, being assembled together with 
ACT.1.5	For Yochanan 
ACT.1.6	When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord - Kurios, will you
ACT.1.7	And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power.
ACT.1.8	But you
ACT.1.9	And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.
ACT.1.10	And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;
ACT.1.11	Which also said, You
ACT.1.12	Then returned they unto Yerushalayim 
ACT.1.13	And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Kefa 
ACT.1.14	These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Miryam 
ACT.1.15	And in those days Kefa 
ACT.1.16	Men 
ACT.1.17	For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.
ACT.1.18	Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels 
ACT.1.19	And it was known unto all the dwellers at Yerushalayim 
ACT.1.20	For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell in it: and his Guardianship 
ACT.1.21	For what reason of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord - Kurios 
ACT.1.22	Beginning from the baptism of Yochanan 
ACT.1.23	And they appointed two, Yosef 
ACT.1.24	And they prayed, and said, you
ACT.1.25	That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Y’hudah 
ACT.1.26	And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Mattityahu 
ACT.2.1	And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.
ACT.2.2	And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
ACT.2.3	And there appeared unto them cloven 
ACT.2.4	And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit 
ACT.2.5	And there were dwelling at Yerushalayim 
ACT.2.6	Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.
ACT.2.7	And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans 
ACT.2.8	And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?
ACT.2.9	Parthians 
ACT.2.10	Phrygia 
ACT.2.11	Cretes [carnal 
ACT.2.12	And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What means this?
ACT.2.13	Others mocking said, These men are full of New Wine.
ACT.2.14	But Kefa 
ACT.2.15	For these are not drunken, as you
ACT.2.16	But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Yo’el 
ACT.2.17	And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God-The Father, I will pour out of my Spirit 
ACT.2.18	And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit 
ACT.2.19	And I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:
ACT.2.20	The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord - Kurios come:
ACT.2.21	And it shall come to pass, 
ACT.2.22	You
ACT.2.23	Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God-The Father, you
ACT.2.24	Whom God-The Father has raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be held of it.
ACT.2.25	For David 
ACT.2.26	Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:
ACT.2.27	Because you
ACT.2.28	you
ACT.2.29	Men 
ACT.2.30	Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God-The Father had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his waist, according to the flesh, he would raise up Moshiach 
ACT.2.31	He seeing this before spoke of the resurrection of Moshiach 
ACT.2.32	This Yeshua 
ACT.2.33	Therefore being by the right hand of God-The Father exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit 
ACT.2.34	For David 
ACT.2.35	Until I make your
ACT.2.36	Therefore let all the house of Yisra’el 
ACT.2.37	Now when they heard 
ACT.2.38	Then Kefa 
ACT.2.39	For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, 
ACT.2.40	And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this perverse 
ACT.2.41	Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added 
ACT.2.42	And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.
ACT.2.43	And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.
ACT.2.44	And all that believed were together, and had all things common;
ACT.2.45	And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all 
ACT.2.46	And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,
ACT.2.47	Praising God-The Father, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord - Kurios added to the church daily such as should be saved.
ACT.3.1	Now Kefa 
ACT.3.2	And a certain man lame from his mother’s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;
ACT.3.3	Who seeing Kefa 
ACT.3.4	And Kefa 
ACT.3.5	And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.
ACT.3.6	Then Kefa 
ACT.3.7	And he took him by the right hand, and lifted 
ACT.3.8	And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God-The Father.
ACT.3.9	And all the people saw him walking and praising God-The Father:
ACT.3.10	And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.
ACT.3.11	And as the lame man which was healed held Kefa 
ACT.3.12	And when Kefa 
ACT.3.13	The God-The Father of Avraham 
ACT.3.14	But you
ACT.3.15	And killed the Prince of Life, whom God-The Father has raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.
ACT.3.16	And his name through faith in his name has made this man strong, whom you
ACT.3.17	And now, brethren, I know that through ignorance you
ACT.3.18	But those things, which God-The Father before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Moshiach 
ACT.3.19	Repent you
ACT.3.20	And he shall send Yeshua 
ACT.3.21	Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God-The Father has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.
ACT.3.22	For Moshe 
ACT.3.23	And it shall come to pass, 
ACT.3.24	Yes, and all the prophets from Sh’mu’el 
ACT.3.25	You
ACT.3.26	Unto you first God-The Father, having raised up his Son Yeshua 
ACT.4.1	And as they spoke unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Tz’dukim 
ACT.4.2	Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Yeshua 
ACT.4.3	And they laid hands on them, and put 
ACT.4.4	However many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.
ACT.4.5	And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and Torah-teachers 
ACT.4.6	And ‘Anan 
ACT.4.7	And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have you
ACT.4.8	Then Kefa 
ACT.4.9	If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent 
ACT.4.10	Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Yisra’el 
ACT.4.11	This is the stone which was set at nothing 
ACT.4.12	Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.
ACT.4.13	Now when they saw the boldness of Kefa 
ACT.4.14	And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
ACT.4.15	But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,
ACT.4.16	Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle has been done by them 
ACT.4.17	But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak from this time forth 
ACT.4.18	And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Yeshua 
ACT.4.19	But Kefa 
ACT.4.20	For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.
ACT.4.21	So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all 
ACT.4.22	For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was showed.
ACT.4.23	And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.
ACT.4.24	And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God-The Father with one accord, and said, Lord - Kurios, you
ACT.4.25	Who by the mouth of your
ACT.4.26	The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord - Kurios, and against his Moshiach 
ACT.4.27	For of a tagainst your
ACT.4.28	For to do whatsoever your
ACT.4.29	And now, Lord - Kurios, behold their threatenings: and grant unto your
ACT.4.30	By stretching forth your
ACT.4.31	And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit 
ACT.4.32	And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any 
ACT.4.33	And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord - Kurios 
ACT.4.34	Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,
ACT.4.35	And laid 
ACT.4.36	And Yosi 
ACT.4.37	Having land, sold 
ACT.5.1	But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,
ACT.5.2	And kept back 
ACT.5.3	But Kefa 
ACT.5.4	Whiles it remained, was it not your
ACT.5.5	And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.
ACT.5.6	And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried 
ACT.5.7	And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.
ACT.5.8	And Kefa 
ACT.5.9	Then Kefa 
ACT.5.10	Then fell she down immediately at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying 
ACT.5.11	And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.
ACT.5.12	And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Shlomo 
ACT.5.13	And of the rest dared 
ACT.5.14	And believers were the more added to the Lord - Kurios, multitudes both of men and women.)
ACT.5.15	Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid 
ACT.5.16	There came also a multitude 
ACT.5.17	Then the High Priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Tz’dukim 
ACT.5.18	And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.
ACT.5.19	But the angel of the Lord - Kurios by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,
ACT.5.20	Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.
ACT.5.21	And when they heard 
ACT.5.22	But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,
ACT.5.23	Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.
ACT.5.24	Now when the High Priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.
ACT.5.25	Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom you
ACT.5.26	Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.
ACT.5.27	And when they had brought them, they set 
ACT.5.28	Saying, Did not we straitly command you that you
ACT.5.29	Then Kefa 
ACT.5.30	The God-The Father of our fathers raised up Yeshua 
ACT.5.31	Him has God-The Father exalted with his right hand 
ACT.5.32	And we are his witnesses of these things; and 
ACT.5.33	When they heard 
ACT.5.34	Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee 
ACT.5.35	And said unto them, You
ACT.5.36	For before these days rose up Todah 
ACT.5.37	After this man rose up Y’hudah 
ACT.5.38	And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nothing:
ACT.5.39	But if it be of God-The Father, you
ACT.5.40	And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten 
ACT.5.41	And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer 
ACT.5.42	And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Yeshua 
ACT.6.1	And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians [Greek [unstable: the miry one]-speaking Jewish people] against the ‘Evri’ot 
ACT.6.2	Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples 
ACT.6.3	For what reason, brethren, look you
ACT.6.4	But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.
ACT.6.5	And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen 
ACT.6.6	Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid 
ACT.6.7	And the word of God-The Father increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Yerushalayim 
ACT.6.8	And Stephen 
ACT.6.9	Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called 
ACT.6.10	And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit 
ACT.6.11	Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moshe 
ACT.6.12	And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the Torah-teachers 
ACT.6.13	And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceases not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:
ACT.6.14	For we have heard him say, that this Yeshua 
ACT.6.15	And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.
ACT.7.1	Then said the High Priest, Are these things so?
ACT.7.2	And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God-The Father of glory appeared unto our father Avraham 
ACT.7.3	And said unto him, Get you
ACT.7.4	Then came he out of the land of the Kasdim 
ACT.7.5	And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not 
ACT.7.6	And God-The Father spoke on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat 
ACT.7.7	And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God-The Father: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.
ACT.7.8	And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so [Avraham 
ACT.7.9	And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Yosef 
ACT.7.10	And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Par’oh 
ACT.7.11	Now there came a famine over all the land of Mitzrayim 
ACT.7.12	But when Ya’akov 
ACT.7.13	And at the second 
ACT.7.14	Then sent Yosef 
ACT.7.15	So Ya’akov 
ACT.7.16	And were carried over into Sh’khem 
ACT.7.17	But when the time of the promise drew near, which God-The Father had sworn to Avraham 
ACT.7.18	Till another king arose, which knew not Yosef 
ACT.7.19	The same dealt subtilly with our family, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.
ACT.7.20	In which time Moshe 
ACT.7.21	And when he was cast out, Par’oh’s 
ACT.7.22	And Moshe 
ACT.7.23	And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the people of Yisra’el 
ACT.7.24	And seeing one 
ACT.7.25	For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God-The Father by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.
ACT.7.26	And the next day he showed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, you
ACT.7.27	But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made you
ACT.7.28	Will you
ACT.7.29	Then fled Moshe 
ACT.7.30	And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai 
ACT.7.31	When Moshe 
ACT.7.33	Then said the Lord - Kurios to him, Put 
ACT.7.34	I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Mitzrayim 
ACT.7.35	This Moshe 
ACT.7.36	He brought them out, after that he had showed wonders and signs in the land of Mitzrayim 
ACT.7.37	This is that Moshe 
ACT.7.38	This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spoke to him in the mount Sinai 
ACT.7.39	To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust 
ACT.7.40	Saying unto Aharon 
ACT.7.41	And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.
ACT.7.42	Then God-The Father turned, and gave them up to worship the army of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O you
ACT.7.43	Yes, you
ACT.7.44	Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moshe 
ACT.7.45	Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Yeshua 
ACT.7.46	Who found favour before God-The Father, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God-The Father of Ya’akov 
ACT.7.47	But Shlomo 
ACT.7.48	However the Most High dwells not in temples made with hands; as says the prophet,
ACT.7.49	Heaven 
ACT.7.50	Has not my hand made all these things?
ACT.7.51	You
ACT.7.52	Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom you
ACT.7.53	Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept 
ACT.7.54	When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with 
ACT.7.55	But he, being full of the Holy Spirit 
ACT.7.56	And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of God-The Father.
ACT.7.57	Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,
ACT.7.58	And cast 
ACT.7.59	And they stoned Stephen 
ACT.7.60	And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord - Kurios, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
ACT.8.1	And Sha’ul 
ACT.8.2	And devout men carried Stephen 
ACT.8.3	As for Sha’ul 
ACT.8.4	Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.
ACT.8.5	Then Philip 
ACT.8.6	And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip 
ACT.8.7	For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed 
ACT.8.8	And there was great joy in that city.
ACT.8.9	But there was a certain man, called Shim’on 
ACT.8.10	To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God-The Father.
ACT.8.11	And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.
ACT.8.12	But when they believed Philip 
ACT.8.13	Then Shim’on 
ACT.8.14	Now when the apostles which were at Yerushalayim 
ACT.8.15	Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit 
ACT.8.16	(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord - Kurios 
ACT.8.17	Then laid they 
ACT.8.18	And when Shim’on 
ACT.8.19	Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit 
ACT.8.20	But Kefa 
ACT.8.21	you
ACT.8.22	Repent therefore of this your
ACT.8.23	For I perceive that you
ACT.8.24	Then answered Shim’on 
ACT.8.25	And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord - Kurios, returned to Yerushalayim 
ACT.8.26	And the angel of the Lord - Kurios spoke unto Philip 
ACT.8.27	And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia 
ACT.8.28	Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Yesha’yahu 
ACT.8.29	Then the Spirit 
ACT.8.30	And Philip 
ACT.8.31	And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip 
ACT.8.32	The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:
ACT.8.33	In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.
ACT.8.34	And the eunuch answered Philip 
ACT.8.35	Then Philip 
ACT.8.36	And as they went on 
ACT.8.37	And Philip 
ACT.8.38	And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip 
ACT.8.39	And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit 
ACT.8.40	But Philip 
ACT.9.1	And Sha’ul 
ACT.9.2	And desired of him letters to Dammesek 
ACT.9.3	And as he journeyed, he came near Dammesek 
ACT.9.4	And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Sha’ul 
ACT.9.5	And he said, Who are you
ACT.9.6	And he trembling and astonished said, Lord - Kurios, what will you
ACT.9.7	And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.
ACT.9.8	And Sha’ul 
ACT.9.9	And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.
ACT.9.10	And there was a certain disciple at Dammesek 
ACT.9.11	And the Lord - Kurios 
ACT.9.12	And has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting 
ACT.9.13	Then Ananias answered, Lord - Kurios, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he has done to your
ACT.9.14	And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on your
ACT.9.15	But the Lord - Kurios said unto him, Go your
ACT.9.16	For I will show him how great things he must suffer 
ACT.9.17	And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Sha’ul 
ACT.9.18	And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.
ACT.9.19	And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Sha’ul 
ACT.9.20	And immediately he preached Moshiach 
ACT.9.21	But all that heard 
ACT.9.22	But Sha’ul 
ACT.9.23	And after that many days were fulfilled, the Y’hudim 
ACT.9.24	But their laying await was known of Sha’ul 
ACT.9.25	Then the disciples took him by night, and let 
ACT.9.26	And when Sha’ul 
ACT.9.27	But Bar-Nabba 
ACT.9.28	And he was with them coming in and going out at Yerushalayim 
ACT.9.29	And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord - Kurios 
ACT.9.31	Then had the churches rest throughout all Y’hudah 
ACT.9.32	And it came to pass, as Kefa 
ACT.9.33	And there he found a certain man named Aeneas 
ACT.9.34	And Kefa 
ACT.9.35	And all that dwelt at Lud 
ACT.9.36	Now there was at Yafo 
ACT.9.37	And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid 
ACT.9.38	And forasmuch as Lud 
ACT.9.39	Then Kefa 
ACT.9.40	But Kefa 
ACT.9.41	And he gave her 
ACT.9.42	And it was known throughout all Yafo 
ACT.9.43	And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Yafo 
ACT.10.1	There was a certain man in Caesarea 
ACT.10.3	He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God-The Father coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius 
ACT.10.4	And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord - Kurios? And he said unto him, Your
ACT.10.5	And now send men to Yafo 
ACT.10.6	He lodgeth with one Shim’on 
ACT.10.7	And when the angel which spoke unto Cornelius 
ACT.10.8	And when he had declared all 
ACT.10.9	On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew near unto the city, Kefa 
ACT.10.10	And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,
ACT.10.11	And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:
ACT.10.12	Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.
ACT.10.13	And there came a voice to him, Rise, Kefa 
ACT.10.14	But Kefa 
ACT.10.15	And the voice 
ACT.10.16	This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.
ACT.10.17	Now while Kefa 
ACT.10.18	And called, and asked whether Shim’on 
ACT.10.19	While Kefa 
ACT.10.20	Arise therefore, and get you
ACT.10.21	Then Kefa 
ACT.10.22	And they said, Cornelius 
ACT.10.23	Then called he them in, and lodged 
ACT.10.24	And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea 
ACT.10.25	And as Kefa 
ACT.10.26	But Kefa 
ACT.10.27	And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.
ACT.10.28	And he said unto them, You
ACT.10.29	Therefore came I 
ACT.10.30	And Cornelius 
ACT.10.31	And said, Cornelius 
ACT.10.32	Send therefore to Yafo 
ACT.10.33	Immediately therefore I sent to you
ACT.10.34	Then Kefa 
ACT.10.35	But in every nation he that fears him, and works righteousness, is accepted with him.
ACT.10.36	The word which 
ACT.10.37	That word, 
ACT.10.38	How God-The Father anointed Yeshua 
ACT.10.39	And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Y’hudim 
ACT.10.40	Him God-The Father raised up the third day, and showed him openly;
ACT.10.41	Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God-The Father, 
ACT.10.42	And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God-The Father 
ACT.10.43	To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believes in him shall receive forgiveness 
ACT.10.44	While Kefa 
ACT.10.45	And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Kefa 
ACT.10.46	For they heard them speak with tongues 
ACT.10.47	Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Spirit 
ACT.10.48	And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord - Kurios. Then prayed they him to wait certain days.
ACT.11.1	And the apostles and brethren that were in Y’hudah 
ACT.11.2	And when Kefa 
ACT.11.3	Saying, you
ACT.11.4	But Kefa 
ACT.11.5	I was in the city of Yafo 
ACT.11.6	Upon the which when I had fastened my eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.
ACT.11.7	And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Kefa 
ACT.11.8	But I said, Not so, Lord - Kurios: for nothing common or unclean has at any time entered into my mouth.
ACT.11.9	But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God-The Father has cleansed, 
ACT.11.10	And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.
ACT.11.11	And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea 
ACT.11.12	And the Spirit 
ACT.11.13	And he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Yafo 
ACT.11.14	Who shall tell you
ACT.11.15	And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit 
ACT.11.16	Then remembered I the word of the Lord - Kurios, how that he said, Yochanan 
ACT.11.17	Forasmuch then as God-The Father gave them the like gift as 
ACT.11.18	When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God-The Father, saying, Then has God-The Father also to the Goyim 
ACT.11.19	Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen 
ACT.11.20	And some of them were men of Cyprus 
ACT.11.21	And the hand of the Lord - Kurios was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord - Kurios.
ACT.11.22	Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Yerushalayim 
ACT.11.23	Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God-The Father, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cling to 
ACT.11.24	For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit 
ACT.11.25	Then departed Bar-Nabba 
ACT.11.26	And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch 
ACT.11.27	And in these days came prophets from Yerushalayim 
ACT.11.28	And there stood up one of them named Agav 
ACT.11.29	Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Y’hudah 
ACT.11.30	Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Bar-Nabba 
ACT.12.1	Now about that time Herod 
ACT.12.2	And he killed Ya’akov 
ACT.12.3	And because he saw it pleased the Y’hudim 
ACT.12.4	And when he had apprehended him, he put 
ACT.12.5	Kefa 
ACT.12.6	And when Herod 
ACT.12.7	And, behold, the angel of the Lord - Kurios came upon 
ACT.12.8	And the angel said unto him, Gird yourself, and bind on your
ACT.12.9	And he went out, and followed him; and did not know not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.
ACT.12.10	When they were past the first and the second ward 
ACT.12.11	And when Kefa 
ACT.12.12	And when he had considered 
ACT.12.13	And as Kefa 
ACT.12.14	And when she knew Kefa 
ACT.12.15	And they said unto her, you
ACT.12.16	But Kefa 
ACT.12.17	But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord - Kurios had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go show these things unto Ya’akov 
ACT.12.18	Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Kefa 
ACT.12.19	And when Herod 
ACT.12.20	And Herod 
ACT.12.21	And upon a set day Herod 
ACT.12.22	And the people gave a shout, 
ACT.12.23	And immediately the angel of the Lord - Kurios struck him, because he gave not God-The Father the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.
ACT.12.24	But the word of God-The Father grew and multiplied.
ACT.12.25	And Bar-Nabba 
ACT.13.1	Now there were in the church that was at Antioch 
ACT.13.2	As they ministered to the Lord - Kurios, and fasted, the Holy Spirit 
ACT.13.3	And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid 
ACT.13.4	So they, being sent forth by the Holy Spirit 
ACT.13.5	And when they were at Salamis 
ACT.13.6	And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos 
ACT.13.7	Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius [earth-born: a wonder] Paulus 
ACT.13.8	But Elymas 
ACT.13.9	Then Sha’ul 
ACT.13.10	And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, 
ACT.13.11	And now, behold, the hand of the Lord - Kurios 
ACT.13.12	Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord - Kurios.
ACT.13.13	Now when Sha’ul 
ACT.13.14	But when they departed from Perga 
ACT.13.15	And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, 
ACT.13.16	Then Sha’ul 
ACT.13.17	The God-The Father of this people of Yisra’el 
ACT.13.18	And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.
ACT.13.19	And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Kena’an 
ACT.13.20	And after that he gave 
ACT.13.21	And afterward they desired a king: and God-The Father gave unto them Sha’ul 
ACT.13.22	And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David 
ACT.13.23	Of this man’s seed has God-The Father according to 
ACT.13.24	When Yochanan 
ACT.13.25	And as Yochanan 
ACT.13.26	Men 
ACT.13.27	For they that dwell at Yerushalayim 
ACT.13.28	And though they found no cause of death 
ACT.13.29	And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took 
ACT.13.30	But God-The Father raised him from the dead:
ACT.13.31	And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galil 
ACT.13.32	And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,
ACT.13.33	God-The Father has fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he has raised up Yeshua 
ACT.13.34	And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, 
ACT.13.35	For what reason he says also in another 
ACT.13.36	For David 
ACT.13.37	But he, whom God-The Father raised again, saw no corruption.
ACT.13.38	Be it known unto you therefore, men 
ACT.13.39	And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which you
ACT.13.40	Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;
ACT.13.41	Behold, you
ACT.13.42	And when the Y’hudim 
ACT.13.43	Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Y’hudim 
ACT.13.44	And the next Shabbat 
ACT.13.45	But when the Y’hudim 
ACT.13.46	Then Sha’ul 
ACT.13.47	For so has the Lord - Kurios commanded us, 
ACT.13.48	And when the Goyim 
ACT.13.49	And the word of the Lord - Kurios was published throughout all the region.
ACT.13.50	But the Y’hudim 
ACT.13.51	But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium 
ACT.13.52	And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Spirit 
ACT.14.1	And it came to pass in Iconium 
ACT.14.2	But the unbelieving Y’hudim 
ACT.14.3	Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord - Kurios, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
ACT.14.4	But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Y’hudim 
ACT.14.5	And when there was an assault made both of the Goyim 
ACT.14.6	They were ware of 
ACT.14.7	And there they preached the Gospel 
ACT.14.8	And there sat a certain man at Lystra 
ACT.14.9	The same heard Sha’ul 
ACT.14.10	Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on your
ACT.14.11	And when the people saw what Sha’ul 
ACT.14.12	And they called Bar-Nabba 
ACT.14.13	Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.
ACT.14.15	And saying, Sirs, why do you
ACT.14.16	Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.
ACT.14.17	Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.
ACT.14.18	And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them.
ACT.14.19	And there came there 
ACT.14.20	However, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Bar-Nabba 
ACT.14.21	And when they had preached the Gospel 
ACT.14.22	Confirming the souls of the disciples, 
ACT.14.23	And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord - Kurios, on whom they believed.
ACT.14.24	And after they had passed throughout Pisidia 
ACT.14.25	And when they had preached the word in Perga 
ACT.14.26	And there sailed to Antioch 
ACT.14.27	And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God-The Father had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Goyim 
ACT.14.28	And there they abode long time with the disciples.
ACT.15.1	And certain men which came down from Y’hudah 
ACT.15.2	When therefore Sha’ul 
ACT.15.3	And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phoenicia 
ACT.15.4	And when they were come to Yerushalayim 
ACT.15.5	But there rose up certain of the sect of the P’rushim 
ACT.15.6	And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.
ACT.15.7	And when there had been much disputing, Kefa 
ACT.15.8	And God-The Father, which knows the hearts, bore them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit 
ACT.15.9	And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.
ACT.15.10	Now therefore why tempt you
ACT.15.11	But we believe that through the grace of the Lord - Kurios 
ACT.15.12	Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Bar-Nabba 
ACT.15.13	And after they had held their peace, Ya’akov 
ACT.15.14	Shim’on 
ACT.15.15	And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
ACT.15.16	After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David 
ACT.15.17	That the residue 
ACT.15.18	Known unto God-The Father are all his works from the beginning of the world.
ACT.15.19	For what reason my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Goyim 
ACT.15.20	But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and 
ACT.15.21	For Moshe 
ACT.15.22	Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch 
ACT.15.23	And they wrote 
ACT.15.24	Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, 
ACT.15.25	It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Bar-Nabba 
ACT.15.26	Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord - Kurios 
ACT.15.27	We have sent therefore Y’hudah 
ACT.15.28	For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit 
ACT.15.29	That you
ACT.15.30	So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch 
ACT.15.32	And Y’hudah 
ACT.15.33	And after they had tarried 
ACT.15.34	Yet it pleased Silas 
ACT.15.35	Sha’ul 
ACT.15.36	And some days after Sha’ul 
ACT.15.37	And Bar-Nabba 
ACT.15.38	But Sha’ul 
ACT.15.39	And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Bar-Nabba 
ACT.15.40	And Sha’ul 
ACT.15.41	And he went through Aram 
ACT.16.1	Then came he to Derbe 
ACT.16.2	Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra 
ACT.16.3	Him would Sha’ul 
ACT.16.4	And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Yerushalayim 
ACT.16.5	And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.
ACT.16.6	Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia 
ACT.16.7	After they were come to Mysia 
ACT.16.8	And they passing by Mysia 
ACT.16.9	And a vision appeared to Sha’ul 
ACT.16.10	And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia 
ACT.16.11	Therefore loosing from Troas 
ACT.16.12	And from there to Philippi 
ACT.16.13	And on the Shabbat 
ACT.16.14	And a certain woman named Lydia 
ACT.16.15	And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought 
ACT.16.16	And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain girl possessed with a Spirit 
ACT.16.17	The same followed Sha’ul 
ACT.16.18	And this did she many days. But Sha’ul 
ACT.16.19	And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Sha’ul 
ACT.16.20	And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Y’hudim 
ACT.16.21	And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans 
ACT.16.22	And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat 
ACT.16.23	And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast 
ACT.16.24	Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.
ACT.16.25	And at midnight Sha’ul 
ACT.16.26	And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bands were loosed.
ACT.16.27	And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.
ACT.16.28	But Sha’ul 
ACT.16.29	Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Sha’ul 
ACT.16.30	And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
ACT.16.31	And they said, Believe on the Lord - Kurios 
ACT.16.32	And they spoke unto him the word of the Lord - Kurios, and to all that were in his house.
ACT.16.33	And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed 
ACT.16.34	And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God-The Father with all his house.
ACT.16.35	And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go.
ACT.16.36	And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Sha’ul 
ACT.16.37	But Sha’ul 
ACT.16.38	And the sergeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans 
ACT.16.39	And they came and besought them, and brought 
ACT.16.40	And they went out of the prison, and entered into 
ACT.17.1	Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica 
ACT.17.2	And Sha’ul 
ACT.17.3	Opening and alleging, that Moshiach 
ACT.17.4	And some of them believed, and consorted with Sha’ul 
ACT.17.5	But the Y’hudim 
ACT.17.6	And when they found them not, they drew Jason 
ACT.17.7	Whom Jason 
ACT.17.8	And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.
ACT.17.9	And when they had taken security of Jason 
ACT.17.10	And the brethren immediately sent away Sha’ul 
ACT.17.11	These were more noble than those in Thessalonica 
ACT.17.12	Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks [unstable: miry ones], and of men, not a few.
ACT.17.13	But when the Y’hudim 
ACT.17.14	And then immediately the brethren sent away Sha’ul 
ACT.17.15	And they that conducted Sha’ul 
ACT.17.16	Now while Sha’ul 
ACT.17.17	Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Y’hudim 
ACT.17.18	Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans [a helper: defender], and of the Stoicks 
ACT.17.19	And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus 
ACT.17.20	For you
ACT.17.21	(For all the Athenians 
ACT.17.22	Then Sha’ul 
ACT.17.23	For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore you
ACT.17.24	God-The Father that made the world and all things in it, seeing that he is Lord - Kurios of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands;
ACT.17.25	Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he gives to all life, and breath, and all things;
ACT.17.26	And has made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;
ACT.17.27	That they should seek the Lord - Kurios, if perhaps 
ACT.17.28	For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.
ACT.17.29	Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God-The Father, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by are and man’s device.
ACT.17.30	And the times of this ignorance God-The Father winked at; but now commands all men every where to repent:
ACT.17.31	Because he has appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by 
ACT.17.32	And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some deceived: and others said, We will hear you
ACT.17.33	So Sha’ul 
ACT.17.34	However certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which 
ACT.18.1	After these things Sha’ul 
ACT.18.2	And found a certain Jewish person named Aquila 
ACT.18.3	And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.
ACT.18.4	And he reasoned in the synagogue every Shabbat 
ACT.18.5	And when Silas 
ACT.18.6	And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook 
ACT.18.7	And he departed there, and entered into a certain 
ACT.18.8	And Crispus 
ACT.18.9	Then spoke the Lord - Kurios to Sha’ul 
ACT.18.10	For I am with you
ACT.18.11	And he continued 
ACT.18.12	And when Gallio 
ACT.18.13	Saying, This 
ACT.18.14	And when Sha’ul 
ACT.18.15	But if it be a question of words and names, and 
ACT.18.16	And he drove them from the judgment seat.
ACT.18.17	Then all the Greeks [unstable: miry ones] took Sosthenes 
ACT.18.18	And Sha’ul 
ACT.18.19	And he came to Ephesus 
ACT.18.20	When they desired 
ACT.18.21	But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that comes in Yerushalayim 
ACT.18.22	And when he had landed at Caesarea 
ACT.18.23	And after he had spent some time 
ACT.18.24	And a certain Jewish man named Apollos 
ACT.18.25	This man was instructed in the way of the Lord - Kurios; and being fervent in the Spirit 
ACT.18.26	And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila 
ACT.18.27	And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia 
ACT.18.28	For he mightily convinced the Y’hudim 
ACT.19.1	And it came to pass, that, while Apollos 
ACT.19.2	He said unto them, Have you
ACT.19.3	And he said unto them, Unto what then were you
ACT.19.4	Then said Sha’ul 
ACT.19.5	When they heard 
ACT.19.6	And when Sha’ul 
ACT.19.7	And all the men were about twelve.
ACT.19.8	And he went into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God-The Father.
ACT.19.9	But when different were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus 
ACT.19.10	And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia 
ACT.19.11	And God-The Father wrought special miracles by the hands of Sha’ul 
ACT.19.12	So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.
ACT.19.13	Then certain of the vagabond Y’hudim 
ACT.19.14	And there were seven sons of 
ACT.19.15	And the evil Spirit 
ACT.19.16	And the man in whom the evil Spirit 
ACT.19.17	And this was known to all the Y’hudim 
ACT.19.18	And many that believed came, and confessed, and showed their deeds.
ACT.19.19	Many of them also which used Divination 
ACT.19.20	So mightily grew the word of God-The Father and prevailed.
ACT.19.21	After these things were ended, Sha’ul 
ACT.19.22	So he sent into Macedonia 
ACT.19.23	And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.
ACT.19.24	For a certain 
ACT.19.25	Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, you
ACT.19.26	Moreover you
ACT.19.27	So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nothing 
ACT.19.28	And when they heard 
ACT.19.29	And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius 
ACT.19.30	And when Sha’ul 
ACT.19.31	And certain of the chief of Asia 
ACT.19.32	Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.
ACT.19.33	And they drew Alexander 
ACT.19.34	But when they knew that he was a Jewish person, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great 
ACT.19.35	And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, 
ACT.19.36	Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, you
ACT.19.37	For you
ACT.19.38	For what reason if Demetrius 
ACT.19.39	But if you
ACT.19.40	For we are in danger to be called in question for this day’s uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.
ACT.19.41	And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.
ACT.20.1	And after the uproar was ceased, Sha’ul 
ACT.20.2	And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much Exhortation 
ACT.20.3	And 
ACT.20.4	And there accompanied him into Asia 
ACT.20.5	These going before tarried for us at Troas 
ACT.20.6	And we sailed away from Philippi 
ACT.20.7	And upon the first 
ACT.20.8	And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.
ACT.20.9	And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus 
ACT.20.10	And Sha’ul 
ACT.20.11	When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.
ACT.20.12	And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.
ACT.20.13	And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos 
ACT.20.14	And when he met with us at Assos 
ACT.20.15	And we sailed there, and came the next 
ACT.20.16	For Sha’ul 
ACT.20.17	And from Miletus 
ACT.20.18	And when they were come to him, he said unto them, You
ACT.20.19	Serving the Lord - Kurios with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Y’hudim 
ACT.20.21	Testifying both to the Y’hudim 
ACT.20.22	And now, behold, I go bound in the Spirit 
ACT.20.23	Save that the Holy Spirit 
ACT.20.24	But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord - Kurios 
ACT.20.25	And now, behold, I know that you
ACT.20.26	For what reason I take you to record this day, that I 
ACT.20.27	For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God-The Father.
ACT.20.28	Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Spirit 
ACT.20.29	For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
ACT.20.30	Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.
ACT.20.31	Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.
ACT.20.32	And now, brethren, I commend you to God-The Father, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.
ACT.20.33	I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.
ACT.20.34	Yes, you
ACT.20.35	I have showed you all things, how that so labouring you
ACT.20.36	And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.
ACT.20.37	And they all wept sore, and fell on Sha’ul 
ACT.20.38	Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spoke, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.
ACT.21.1	And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos 
ACT.21.2	And finding a ship sailing over unto Phoenicia 
ACT.21.3	Now when we had discovered Cyprus 
ACT.21.4	And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Sha’ul 
ACT.21.5	And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till 
ACT.21.6	And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again.
ACT.21.7	And when we had finished 
ACT.21.8	And the next 
ACT.21.9	And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.
ACT.21.10	And as we tarried 
ACT.21.11	And when he was come unto us, he took Sha’ul 
ACT.21.12	And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Yerushalayim 
ACT.21.13	Then Sha’ul 
ACT.21.14	And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord - Kurios be done.
ACT.21.15	And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Yerushalayim 
ACT.21.16	There went with us also 
ACT.21.17	And when we were come to Yerushalayim 
ACT.21.18	And the 
ACT.21.19	And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God-The Father had wrought among the Goyim 
ACT.21.20	And when they heard 
ACT.21.21	And they are informed of you
ACT.21.22	What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that you
ACT.21.23	Do therefore this that we say to you
ACT.21.24	Them take, and purify yourself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave 
ACT.21.25	As touching the Goyim 
ACT.21.26	Then Sha’ul 
ACT.21.27	And when the seven days were almost ended, the Y’hudim 
ACT.21.28	Crying out, Men of Yisra’el 
ACT.21.29	(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus 
ACT.21.30	And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Sha’ul 
ACT.21.31	And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Yerushalayim 
ACT.21.32	Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Sha’ul 
ACT.21.33	Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded 
ACT.21.34	And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.
ACT.21.35	And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.
ACT.21.36	For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.
ACT.21.37	And as Sha’ul 
ACT.21.38	Are not you
ACT.21.39	But Sha’ul 
ACT.21.40	And when he had given him license, Sha’ul 
ACT.22.1	Men, brethren, and fathers, hear you
ACT.22.2	(And when they heard that he spoke in the ‘Evri’ot 
ACT.22.3	I am truly a man 
ACT.22.4	And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.
ACT.22.5	As also the High Priest does bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Dammesek 
ACT.22.6	And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come near unto Dammesek 
ACT.22.7	And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Sha’ul 
ACT.22.8	And I answered, Who are you
ACT.22.9	And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spoke to me.
ACT.22.10	And I said, What shall I do, Lord - Kurios? And the Lord - Kurios said unto me, Arise, and go into Dammesek 
ACT.22.11	And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Dammesek 
ACT.22.12	And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Y’hudim 
ACT.22.13	Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Sha’ul 
ACT.22.14	And he said, The God-The Father of our fathers has chosen you
ACT.22.15	For you
ACT.22.16	And now why wait you
ACT.22.17	And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Yerushalayim 
ACT.22.18	And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get you
ACT.22.19	And I said, Lord - Kurios, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on you
ACT.22.20	And when the blood of your
ACT.22.21	And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send you
ACT.22.22	And they gave him audience unto this word, and 
ACT.22.23	And as they cried out, and cast off 
ACT.22.24	The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.
ACT.22.25	And as they bound him with thongs, Sha’ul 
ACT.22.26	When the Centurion 
ACT.22.27	Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, are you
ACT.22.28	And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Sha’ul 
ACT.22.29	Then immediately they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman 
ACT.22.30	On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Y’hudim 
ACT.23.1	And Sha’ul 
ACT.23.2	And the High Priest Ananias 
ACT.23.3	Then said Sha’ul 
ACT.23.4	And they that stood by said, Revile you
ACT.23.5	Then said Sha’ul 
ACT.23.6	But when Sha’ul 
ACT.23.7	And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the P’rushim 
ACT.23.8	For the Tz’dukim 
ACT.23.9	And there arose a great cry: and the Torah-teachers 
ACT.23.10	And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Sha’ul 
ACT.23.11	And the night following the Lord - Kurios stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Sha’ul 
ACT.23.12	And when it was day, certain of the Y’hudim 
ACT.23.13	And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.
ACT.23.14	And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Sha’ul 
ACT.23.15	Now therefore you
ACT.23.16	And when Sha’ul 
ACT.23.17	Then Sha’ul 
ACT.23.18	So he took him, and brought 
ACT.23.19	Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went 
ACT.23.20	And he said, The Y’hudim 
ACT.23.21	But do not you
ACT.23.22	So the chief captain 
ACT.23.23	And he called unto 
ACT.23.24	And provide 
ACT.23.25	And he wrote a letter after this manner:
ACT.23.26	Claudius 
ACT.23.27	This man was taken of the Y’hudim 
ACT.23.28	And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:
ACT.23.29	Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.
ACT.23.30	And when it was told me how that the Y’hudim 
ACT.23.31	Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Sha’ul 
ACT.23.32	On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:
ACT.23.33	Who, when they came to Caesarea 
ACT.23.34	And when the governor had read 
ACT.23.35	I will hear you
ACT.24.1	And after five days Ananias 
ACT.24.2	And when he was called forth, Tertullus 
ACT.24.3	We accept 
ACT.24.4	Yet, that I be not further tedious unto you
ACT.24.5	For we have found this man 
ACT.24.6	Who also has gone about to Profane 
ACT.24.7	But the chief captain Lysias 
ACT.24.8	Commanding his accusers to come unto you
ACT.24.9	And the Y’hudim 
ACT.24.10	Then Sha’ul 
ACT.24.11	Because that you
ACT.24.12	And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:
ACT.24.13	Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.
ACT.24.14	But this I confess unto you
ACT.24.15	And have hope toward God-The Father, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.
ACT.24.16	And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God-The Father, and 
ACT.24.17	Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.
ACT.24.18	Whereupon certain Y’hudim 
ACT.24.19	Who ought to have been here before you
ACT.24.20	Or else let these same 
ACT.24.21	Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.
ACT.24.22	And when Felix 
ACT.24.23	And he commanded a Centurion 
ACT.24.24	And after certain days, when Felix 
ACT.24.25	And as he reasoned of righteousness, self-control, and judgment to come, Felix 
ACT.24.26	He hoped also that money should have been given him of Sha’ul 
ACT.24.27	But after two years Porcius Festus 
ACT.25.1	Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea 
ACT.25.2	Then the High Priest and the chief of the Y’hudim 
ACT.25.3	And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Yerushalayim 
ACT.25.4	But Festus answered, that Sha’ul 
ACT.25.5	Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with 
ACT.25.6	And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea 
ACT.25.7	And when he was come, the Y’hudim 
ACT.25.8	While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Y’hudim 
ACT.25.9	But Festus, willing to do the Y’hudim 
ACT.25.10	Then said Sha’ul 
ACT.25.11	For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar 
ACT.25.12	Then Festus 
ACT.25.13	And after certain days king Agrippa 
ACT.25.14	And when they had been there many days, Festus 
ACT.25.15	About whom, when I was at Yerushalayim 
ACT.25.16	To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans 
ACT.25.17	Therefore, when they were come here, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.
ACT.25.18	Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:
ACT.25.19	But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Yeshua 
ACT.25.20	And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked 
ACT.25.21	But when Sha’ul 
ACT.25.22	Then Agrippa 
ACT.25.23	And on the morrow, when Agrippa 
ACT.25.24	And Festus 
ACT.25.25	But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself has appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.
ACT.25.26	Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. For what reason I have brought him forth before you, and specially before you
ACT.25.27	For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes 
ACT.26.1	Then Agrippa 
ACT.26.2	I think myself happy, king Agrippa 
ACT.26.3	Especially 
ACT.26.4	My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among my own nation at Yerushalayim 
ACT.26.5	Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee 
ACT.26.6	And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God-The Father unto our fathers:
ACT.26.7	Unto which 
ACT.26.8	Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God-The Father should raise the dead?
ACT.26.9	I truly thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Yeshua 
ACT.26.10	Which thing I also did in Yerushalayim 
ACT.26.11	And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled 
ACT.26.12	Whereupon as I went to Dammesek 
ACT.26.13	At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.
ACT.26.14	And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the ‘Evri’ot 
ACT.26.15	And I said, Who are you
ACT.26.16	But rise, and stand upon your
ACT.26.17	Delivering you
ACT.26.18	To open their eyes, 
ACT.26.19	Whereupon, O king Agrippa 
ACT.26.20	But showed first unto them of Dammesek 
ACT.26.21	For these causes the Y’hudim 
ACT.26.22	Having therefore obtained help of God-The Father, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moshe 
ACT.26.23	That Moshiach 
ACT.26.24	And as he thus spoke for himself, Festus 
ACT.26.25	But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus 
ACT.26.26	For the king knows of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.
ACT.26.27	King Agrippa 
ACT.26.28	Then Agrippa 
ACT.26.29	And Sha’ul 
ACT.26.30	And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice 
ACT.26.31	And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
ACT.26.32	Then said Agrippa 
ACT.27.1	And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy 
ACT.27.2	And entering into a ship of Adramyttium 
ACT.27.3	And the next 
ACT.27.4	And when we had launched from there, we sailed under Cyprus 
ACT.27.5	And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia 
ACT.27.6	And there the Centurion 
ACT.27.7	And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus 
ACT.27.8	And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The Fair Havens; near whereunto was the city 
ACT.27.9	Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Sha’ul 
ACT.27.10	And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.
ACT.27.11	Nevertheless the Centurion 
ACT.27.12	And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart there also, if by any means they might attain to Phoenicia 
ACT.27.13	And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained 
ACT.27.14	But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon 
ACT.27.15	And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let 
ACT.27.16	And running under a certain island which is called Clauda 
ACT.27.17	Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, struck sail, and so were driven.
ACT.27.18	And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next 
ACT.27.19	And the third 
ACT.27.20	And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on 
ACT.27.21	But after long abstinence Sha’ul 
ACT.27.22	And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of 
ACT.27.23	For there stood by me this night the angel of God-The Father, whose I am, and whom I serve,
ACT.27.24	Saying, Fear not, Sha’ul 
ACT.27.25	For what reason, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God-The Father, that it shall be even as it was told me.
ACT.27.26	However we must be cast upon a certain island.
ACT.27.27	But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria 
ACT.27.28	And sounded, and found 
ACT.27.29	Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.
ACT.27.30	And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,
ACT.27.31	Sha’ul 
ACT.27.32	Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.
ACT.27.33	And while the day was coming on, Sha’ul 
ACT.27.34	For what reason I pray you to take 
ACT.27.35	And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God-The Father in presence of them all: and when he had broken 
ACT.27.36	Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took 
ACT.27.37	And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.
ACT.27.38	And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.
ACT.27.39	And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.
ACT.27.40	And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed 
ACT.27.41	And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.
ACT.27.42	And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.
ACT.27.43	But the Centurion 
ACT.27.44	And the rest, some on boards, and some on 
ACT.28.1	And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita 
ACT.28.2	And the barbarous 
ACT.28.3	And when Sha’ul 
ACT.28.4	And when the barbarians saw the 
ACT.28.5	And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.
ACT.28.6	However they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.
ACT.28.7	In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius 
ACT.28.8	And it came to pass, that the father of Publius 
ACT.28.9	So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:
ACT.28.10	Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded 
ACT.28.11	And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria 
ACT.28.12	And landing at Syracuse 
ACT.28.13	And from there we went on a circular course (go around, encircle; encompass), and came to Rhegium [breach (breaking forth; a break; opening, inlet)]: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli 
ACT.28.14	Where we found brethren, and were desired to wait with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome 
ACT.28.15	And from there, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii 
ACT.28.16	And when we came to Rome 
ACT.28.17	And it came to pass, that after three days Sha’ul 
ACT.28.18	Who, when they had examined me, would have let 
ACT.28.19	But when the Y’hudim 
ACT.28.20	For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see 
ACT.28.21	And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Y’hudah 
ACT.28.22	But we desire to hear of you
ACT.28.23	And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into 
ACT.28.24	And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.
ACT.28.25	And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Sha’ul 
ACT.28.26	Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing you
ACT.28.27	For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with 
ACT.28.28	Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God-The Father is sent unto the Goyim 
ACT.28.29	And when he had said these words, the Y’hudim 
ACT.28.30	And Sha’ul 
ACT.28.31	Preaching the kingdom of God-The Father, and teaching those things which concern the Lord - Kurios 
ROM.1.1	Sha’ul 
ROM.1.2	(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)
ROM.1.3	Concerning his Son Yeshua 
ROM.1.4	And declared 
ROM.1.5	By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:
ROM.1.6	Among whom are you
ROM.1.7	To all that be in Rome 
ROM.1.8	First, I thank my God-The Father through Yeshua 
ROM.1.9	For God-The Father is my witness, whom I serve with my Spirit 
ROM.1.10	Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God-The Father to come unto you.
ROM.1.11	For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end you
ROM.1.12	That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.
ROM.1.13	Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but hinder 
ROM.1.14	I am debtor both to the Greeks 
ROM.1.15	So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the Gospel 
ROM.1.16	For I am not ashamed of the Gospel 
ROM.1.17	For in it is the righteousness of God-The Father revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.
ROM.1.18	For the wrath of God-The Father is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the tin unrighteousness;
ROM.1.19	Because that which may be known of God-The Father is manifest in them; for God-The Father has showed 
ROM.1.20	For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, 
ROM.1.21	Because that, when they knew God-The Father, they glorified 
ROM.1.22	Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
ROM.1.23	And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God-The Father into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.
ROM.1.24	For what reason God-The Father also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:
ROM.1.25	Who changed the tof God-The Father into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is Blessed 
ROM.1.26	For this cause God-The Father gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:
ROM.1.27	And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is inappropriate, and receiving in themselves that recompence 
ROM.1.28	And even as they did not like to retain God-The Father in 
ROM.1.29	Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
ROM.1.30	Backbiters, haters of God-The Father, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
ROM.1.31	Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable 
ROM.1.32	Who knowing the judgment of God-The Father, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.
ROM.2.1	Therefore you
ROM.2.2	But we are sure that the judgment of God-The Father is according to tagainst them which commit such things.
ROM.2.3	And think you
ROM.2.4	Or despise you
ROM.2.5	But after your
ROM.2.6	Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
ROM.2.7	To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:
ROM.2.8	But unto them that are contentious 
ROM.2.9	Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that does evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;
ROM.2.10	But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:
ROM.2.11	For there is no respect of persons with God-The Father.
ROM.2.12	For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;
ROM.2.13	(For not the hearers of the law 
ROM.2.14	For when the Goyim 
ROM.2.15	Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and 
ROM.2.16	In the day when God-The Father shall judge the secrets of men by Yeshua 
ROM.2.17	Behold, you
ROM.2.18	And know 
ROM.2.19	And are confident that you
ROM.2.20	An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which have the form of knowledge and of the tin the law.
ROM.2.21	you
ROM.2.22	you
ROM.2.23	you
ROM.2.24	For the name of God-The Father is blasphemed among the Goyim 
ROM.2.25	For circumcision truly profits, if you
ROM.2.26	Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
ROM.2.27	And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfill the law, judge you
ROM.2.28	For he is not a Jewish person, which is one outwardly; neither 
ROM.2.29	But he 
ROM.3.1	What advantage then has the Jew? or what profit 
ROM.3.2	Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God-The Father.
ROM.3.3	For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God-The Father without effect?
ROM.3.4	May it not be: yes, let God-The Father be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That you
ROM.3.5	But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God-The Father, what shall we say? 
ROM.3.6	May it not be: for then how shall God-The Father judge the world?
ROM.3.7	For if the tof God-The Father has more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
ROM.3.8	And not 
ROM.3.9	What then? are we better 
ROM.3.10	As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
ROM.3.11	There is none that understands, there is none that seeks after God-The Father.
ROM.3.12	They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that does good, no, not one.
ROM.3.13	Their throat 
ROM.3.14	Whose mouth 
ROM.3.15	Their feet 
ROM.3.16	Destruction and misery 
ROM.3.17	And the way of peace have they not known:
ROM.3.18	There is no fear of God-The Father before their eyes.
ROM.3.19	Now we know that what things soever the law says, it says to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God-The Father.
ROM.3.20	Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law 
ROM.3.21	But now the righteousness of God-The Father without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
ROM.3.22	Even the righteousness of God-The Father 
ROM.3.23	For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God-The Father;
ROM.3.24	Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Moshiach 
ROM.3.25	Whom God-The Father has set forth 
ROM.3.26	To declare, 
ROM.3.27	Where 
ROM.3.28	Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.
ROM.3.30	Seeing 
ROM.3.31	Do we then make void the law through faith? May it not be: yes, we establish the law.
ROM.4.1	What shall we say then that Avraham 
ROM.4.2	For if Avraham 
ROM.4.3	For what says the scripture? Avraham 
ROM.4.4	Now to him that works is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.
ROM.4.5	But to him that works not, but believes on him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
ROM.4.6	Even as David 
ROM.4.8	Blessed 
ROM.4.10	How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
ROM.4.11	And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which 
ROM.4.12	And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Avraham 
ROM.4.13	For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, 
ROM.4.14	For if they which are of the law 
ROM.4.15	Because the law works wrath: for where no law is, 
ROM.4.16	Therefore 
ROM.4.17	(As it is written, I have made you
ROM.4.18	Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall your
ROM.4.19	And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah 
ROM.4.20	He staggered not at the promise of God-The Father through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God-The Father;
ROM.4.21	And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to finish.
ROM.4.22	And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
ROM.4.23	Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;
ROM.4.24	But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Yeshua 
ROM.4.25	Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.
ROM.5.1	Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God-The Father through our Lord - Kurios 
ROM.5.2	By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God-The Father.
ROM.5.3	And not only 
ROM.5.4	And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
ROM.5.5	And hope makes not ashamed; because the love of God-The Father is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit 
ROM.5.6	For when we were yet without strength, in due time Moshiach 
ROM.5.7	For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet perhaps for a good man some would even dare to die.
ROM.5.8	But God-The Father commends his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Moshiach 
ROM.5.9	Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
ROM.5.10	For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God-The Father by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.
ROM.5.11	And not only 
ROM.5.12	For what reason, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:
ROM.5.13	(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
ROM.5.14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam 
ROM.5.15	But not as the offence, so also 
ROM.5.16	And not as 
ROM.5.17	For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Yeshua 
ROM.5.18	Therefore as by the offence of one 
ROM.5.19	For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
ROM.5.20	Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:
ROM.5.21	That as sin has reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Yeshua 
ROM.6.1	What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
ROM.6.2	May it not be. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer in it?
ROM.6.3	Know you
ROM.6.4	Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Moshiach 
ROM.6.5	For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also 
ROM.6.6	Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with 
ROM.6.7	For he that is dead is freed from sin.
ROM.6.8	Now if we be dead with Moshiach 
ROM.6.9	Knowing that Moshiach 
ROM.6.10	For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he lives, he lives unto God-The Father.
ROM.6.11	Likewise reckon you
ROM.6.12	Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that you
ROM.6.13	Neither yield you
ROM.6.14	For sin shall not have dominion over you: for you
ROM.6.15	What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? May it not be.
ROM.6.16	Know you
ROM.6.17	But God-The Father be thanked, that you
ROM.6.18	Being then made free from sin, you
ROM.6.19	I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as you
ROM.6.20	For when you
ROM.6.21	What fruit had you
ROM.6.22	But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God-The Father, you
ROM.6.23	For the wages of sin 
ROM.7.1	Know you
ROM.7.2	For the woman which has an husband is bound by the law to 
ROM.7.3	So then if, while 
ROM.7.4	For what reason, my brethren, you
ROM.7.5	For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.
ROM.7.6	But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of Spirit 
ROM.7.7	What shall we say then? 
ROM.7.8	But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence 
ROM.7.9	For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.
ROM.7.10	And the commandment, which 
ROM.7.11	For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed 
ROM.7.12	For what reason the law 
ROM.7.13	Was then that which is good made death unto me? May it not be. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.
ROM.7.14	For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal 
ROM.7.15	For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.
ROM.7.16	If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that 
ROM.7.17	Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.
ROM.7.18	For I know that in me 
ROM.7.19	For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.
ROM.7.20	Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.
ROM.7.21	I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.
ROM.7.22	For I delight in the law of God-The Father after the inward man:
ROM.7.23	But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
ROM.7.24	O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
ROM.7.25	I thank God-The Father through Yeshua 
ROM.8.2	For the law of the Spirit 
ROM.8.3	For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God-The Father sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
ROM.8.4	That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit 
ROM.8.5	For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit 
ROM.8.6	For to be carnally minded 
ROM.8.7	Because the carnal 
ROM.8.8	So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God-The Father.
ROM.8.9	But you
ROM.8.10	And if Moshiach 
ROM.8.11	But if the Spirit 
ROM.8.12	Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.
ROM.8.13	For if you
ROM.8.14	For as many as are led by the Spirit 
ROM.8.15	For you
ROM.8.16	The Spirit 
ROM.8.17	And if children, then heirs; heirs of God-The Father, and joint-heirs with Moshiach 
ROM.8.18	For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time 
ROM.8.19	For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God-The Father.
ROM.8.20	For the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected 
ROM.8.21	Because the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God-The Father.
ROM.8.22	For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.
ROM.8.23	And not only 
ROM.8.24	For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for?
ROM.8.25	But if we hope for that we see not, 
ROM.8.26	Likewise the Spirit 
ROM.8.27	And he that searches the hearts knows what 
ROM.8.28	And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God-The Father, to them who are the called according to 
ROM.8.29	For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate 
ROM.8.30	Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
ROM.8.31	What shall we then say to these things? If God-The Father 
ROM.8.32	He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
ROM.8.33	Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God-The Father’s elect? 
ROM.8.34	Who 
ROM.8.35	Who shall separate us from the love of Moshiach 
ROM.8.36	As it is written, For your
ROM.8.37	No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
ROM.8.38	For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor Principalities 
ROM.8.39	Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God-The Father, which is in Moshiach 
ROM.9.1	I say the tin Moshiach 
ROM.9.2	That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.
ROM.9.3	For I could wish that myself were accursed from Moshiach 
ROM.9.4	Who are Yisra’eli’s; to whom 
ROM.9.5	Whose 
ROM.9.6	Not as though the word of God-The Father has taken none effect. For they 
ROM.9.7	Neither, because they are the seed of Avraham 
ROM.9.8	That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these 
ROM.9.9	For this 
ROM.9.10	And not only 
ROM.9.11	(For 
ROM.9.12	It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.
ROM.9.13	As it is written, Ya’akov 
ROM.9.14	What shall we say then? 
ROM.9.15	For he says to Moshe 
ROM.9.16	So then 
ROM.9.17	For the scripture says unto Par’oh 
ROM.9.18	Therefore has he mercy on whom he will 
ROM.9.19	you
ROM.9.20	No but, O man, who are you
ROM.9.21	Has not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?
ROM.9.23	And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,
ROM.9.24	Even us, whom he has called, not of the Y’hudim 
ROM.9.25	As he says also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.
ROM.9.26	And it shall come to pass, 
ROM.9.27	Yesha’yahu 
ROM.9.28	For he will finish the work, and cut 
ROM.9.29	And as Yesha’yahu 
ROM.9.30	What shall we say then? That the Goyim 
ROM.9.31	But Yisra’el 
ROM.9.32	For what reason? Because 
ROM.9.33	As it is written, Behold, I lay in Tziyon 
ROM.10.1	Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God-The Father for Yisra’el 
ROM.10.2	For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God-The Father, but not according to knowledge.
ROM.10.3	For they being ignorant of God-The Father’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God-The Father.
ROM.10.4	For Moshiach 
ROM.10.5	For Moshe 
ROM.10.6	But the righteousness which is of faith speaks on this wise, Say not in your
ROM.10.7	Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Moshiach 
ROM.10.8	But what says it? The word is near you
ROM.10.9	That if you
ROM.10.10	For with the heart man believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
ROM.10.11	For the scripture says, Whosoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.
ROM.10.12	For there is no difference between the Jewish person and the Greek [unstable: the miry one]: for the same Lord - Kurios over all is rich unto all that call upon him.
ROM.10.13	For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord - Kurios shall be saved.
ROM.10.14	How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
ROM.10.15	And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Gospel 
ROM.10.16	But they have not all obeyed the Gospel 
ROM.10.17	So then faith 
ROM.10.18	But I say, Have they not heard? Yes truly, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.
ROM.10.19	But I say, Did not Yisra’el 
ROM.10.20	But Yesha’yahu 
ROM.10.21	But to Yisra’el 
ROM.11.1	I say then, Has God-The Father cast away his people? May it not be. For I also am an Israeli, of the seed of Avraham 
ROM.11.2	God-The Father has not cast away his people which he foreknew. Knew 
ROM.11.3	Lord - Kurios, they have killed your
ROM.11.4	But what says the answer of God-The Father unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to 
ROM.11.5	Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
ROM.11.6	And if by grace, then 
ROM.11.7	What then? Yisra’el 
ROM.11.8	(According as it is written, God-The Father has given them the Spirit 
ROM.11.9	And David 
ROM.11.10	Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back always.
ROM.11.11	I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? May it not be: but 
ROM.11.12	Now if the fall of them 
ROM.11.13	For I speak to you Goyim 
ROM.11.14	If by any means I may provoke to emulation 
ROM.11.15	For if the casting away of them 
ROM.11.16	For if the firstfruit 
ROM.11.17	And if some of the branches be broken off, and you
ROM.11.18	Boast not against the branches. But if you
ROM.11.19	you
ROM.11.20	Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and you
ROM.11.21	For if God-The Father spared not the natural branches, 
ROM.11.22	Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God-The Father: on them which fell, severity; but toward you
ROM.11.23	And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God-The Father is able to graff them in again.
ROM.11.24	For if you
ROM.11.25	For I would not, brethren, that you
ROM.11.26	And so all Yisra’el 
ROM.11.27	For this 
ROM.11.28	As concerning the Gospel 
ROM.11.29	For the gifts and calling of God-The Father 
ROM.11.30	For as you
ROM.11.31	Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.
ROM.11.32	For God-The Father has concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.
ROM.11.33	O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God-The Father! how unsearchable 
ROM.11.34	For who has known the mind of the Lord - Kurios? or who has been his counsellor?
ROM.11.35	Or who has first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?
ROM.11.36	For of him, and through him, and to him, 
ROM.12.1	I beseech 
ROM.12.2	And be not conformed to this world: but be you
ROM.12.3	For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think 
ROM.12.4	For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:
ROM.12.5	So we, 
ROM.12.6	Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, 
ROM.12.7	Or ministry, 
ROM.12.8	Or he that exhorts, on Exhortation 
ROM.12.11	Not slothful in business; fervent in Spirit 
ROM.12.12	Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;
ROM.12.13	Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.
ROM.12.14	Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.
ROM.12.15	Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.
ROM.12.17	Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.
ROM.12.18	If it be possible, as much as lies in you, live peaceably with all men.
ROM.12.19	Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but 
ROM.12.20	Therefore if your
ROM.12.21	Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
ROM.13.1	Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God-The Father: the powers that be are ordained of God-The Father.
ROM.13.2	Whosoever therefore resists the power, resists the ordinance of God-The Father: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.
ROM.13.3	For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Will you
ROM.13.4	For he is the minister of God-The Father to you
ROM.13.5	For what reason 
ROM.13.6	For for this cause pay you
ROM.13.7	Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute 
ROM.13.8	Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loves another has fulfilled the law.
ROM.13.9	For this, you
ROM.13.10	Love works no ill to his neighbour: therefore love 
ROM.13.11	And that, knowing the time, that now 
ROM.13.12	The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.
ROM.13.13	Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in lewdness 
ROM.13.14	But put you
ROM.14.1	Him that is weak in the faith receive you
ROM.14.2	For one believes that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eats herbs.
ROM.14.3	Let not him that eats despise him that eats not; and let not him which eats not judge him that eats: for God-The Father has received him.
ROM.14.4	Who are you
ROM.14.5	One man esteems one day above another: another esteems every day 
ROM.14.6	He that regards the day, regards 
ROM.14.7	For none of us lives to himself, and no man dies to himself.
ROM.14.8	For whether we live, we live unto the Lord - Kurios; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord - Kurios: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord - Kurios’s.
ROM.14.9	For to this end Moshiach 
ROM.14.10	But why do you
ROM.14.11	For it is written, 
ROM.14.12	So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God-The Father.
ROM.14.13	Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in 
ROM.14.14	I know, and am persuaded by the Lord - Kurios 
ROM.14.15	But if your
ROM.14.16	Let not then your good be evil spoken of:
ROM.14.17	For the kingdom of God-The Father is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit 
ROM.14.18	For he that in these things serves Moshiach 
ROM.14.19	Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things which one may edify another.
ROM.14.20	For meat destroy not the work of God-The Father. All things indeed 
ROM.14.22	Have you
ROM.14.23	And he that doubts is judged if he eat, because 
ROM.14.24	Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my Gospel 
ROM.14.25	But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God-The Father, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:
ROM.14.26	To God-The Father only wise, 
ROM.15.1	We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
ROM.15.2	Let every one of us please 
ROM.15.3	For even Moshiach 
ROM.15.4	For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.
ROM.15.5	Now the God-The Father of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Moshiach 
ROM.15.6	That you
ROM.15.7	For what reason receive you
ROM.15.8	Now I say that Yeshua 
ROM.15.9	And that the Goyim 
ROM.15.10	And again he says, Rejoice, you
ROM.15.11	And again, Praise the Lord - Kurios, all you
ROM.15.12	And again, Yesha’yahu 
ROM.15.13	Now the God-The Father of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you
ROM.15.14	And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that you
ROM.15.15	Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God-The Father,
ROM.15.16	That I should be the minister of Yeshua 
ROM.15.17	I have therefore whereof I may glory through Yeshua 
ROM.15.18	For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Moshiach 
ROM.15.19	Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit 
ROM.15.20	Yes, so have I strived to preach the Gospel 
ROM.15.21	But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.
ROM.15.22	For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.
ROM.15.23	But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;
ROM.15.24	Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way toward it by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your 
ROM.15.25	But now I go unto Yerushalayim 
ROM.15.26	For it has pleased them of Macedonia 
ROM.15.27	It has pleased them truly; and their debtors they are. For if the Goyim 
ROM.15.28	When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.
ROM.15.29	And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the Gospel 
ROM.15.30	Now I beseech 
ROM.15.31	That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Y’hudah 
ROM.15.32	That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God-The Father, and may with you be refreshed.
ROM.15.33	Now the God-The Father of peace 
ROM.16.1	I commend unto you Phebe 
ROM.16.2	That you
ROM.16.3	Greet Priscilla 
ROM.16.4	Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Goyim 
ROM.16.5	Likewise 
ROM.16.6	Greet Miryam 
ROM.16.7	Salute Andronicus 
ROM.16.8	Greet Amplias 
ROM.16.9	Salute Urbane 
ROM.16.10	Salute Apelles 
ROM.16.11	Salute Herodion 
ROM.16.12	Salute Tryphena 
ROM.16.13	Salute Rufus 
ROM.16.14	Salute Asyncritus 
ROM.16.15	Salute Philologus 
ROM.16.16	Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Moshiach 
ROM.16.17	Now I beseech 
ROM.16.18	For they that are such serve not our Lord - Kurios 
ROM.16.19	For your obedience is come abroad unto all 
ROM.16.20	And the God-The Father of peace shall bruise Satan 
ROM.16.21	Timothy 
ROM.16.22	I Tertius 
ROM.16.23	Gaius 
ROM.16.24	The grace of our Lord - Kurios 
ROM.16.25	Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my Gospel 
ROM.16.26	But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God-The Father, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:
ROM.16.27	To God-The Father only wise, 
1CO.1.1	Sha’ul 
1CO.1.2	Unto the church of God-The Father which is at Corinth 
1CO.1.3	Grace 
1CO.1.4	I thank my God-The Father always on your behalf, for the grace of God-The Father which is given you by Yeshua 
1CO.1.5	That in every thing you
1CO.1.6	Even as the testimony of Moshiach 
1CO.1.7	So that you
1CO.1.8	Who shall also confirm you unto the end, [that you
1CO.1.9	God-The Father 
1CO.1.10	Now I beseech 
1CO.1.11	For it has been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them 
1CO.1.12	Now this I say, that every one of you says, I am of Sha’ul 
1CO.1.13	Is Moshiach 
1CO.1.14	I thank God-The Father that I baptized none of you, but Crispus 
1CO.1.15	Lest any should say that I had baptized in my own name.
1CO.1.16	And I baptized also the household of Stephanas 
1CO.1.17	For Moshiach 
1CO.1.18	For the preaching of the stake 
1CO.1.19	For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.
1CO.1.20	Where 
1CO.1.21	For after that in the wisdom of God-The Father the world by wisdom knew not God-The Father, it pleased God-The Father by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.
1CO.1.22	For the Y’hudim 
1CO.1.23	But we preach Moshiach 
1CO.1.24	But unto them which are called, both Y’hudim 
1CO.1.25	Because the foolishness of God-The Father is wiser than men; and the weakness of God-The Father is stronger than men.
1CO.1.26	For you
1CO.1.27	But God-The Father has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God-The Father has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;
1CO.1.28	And base things of the world, and things which are despised, has God-The Father chosen, 
1CO.1.29	That no flesh should glory in his presence.
1CO.1.30	But of him are you
1CO.1.31	That, according as it is written, He that glories, let him glory in the Lord - Kurios.
1CO.2.1	And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God-The Father.
1CO.2.2	For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Yeshua 
1CO.2.3	And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
1CO.2.4	And my speech and my preaching 
1CO.2.5	That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God-The Father.
1CO.2.6	However we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:
1CO.2.7	But we speak the wisdom of God-The Father in a mystery, 
1CO.2.8	Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known 
1CO.2.9	But as it is written, Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God-The Father has prepared for them that love him.
1CO.2.10	But God-The Father has revealed 
1CO.2.11	For what man knows the things of a man, save the Spirit 
1CO.2.12	Now we have received, not the Spirit 
1CO.2.13	Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit 
1CO.2.14	But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit 
1CO.2.15	But he that is spiritual all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.
1CO.2.16	For who has known the mind of the Lord - Kurios, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Moshiach 
1CO.3.1	And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal 
1CO.3.2	I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for up to this time you
1CO.3.3	For you
1CO.3.4	For while one says, I am of Sha’ul 
1CO.3.5	Who then is Sha’ul 
1CO.3.6	I have planted, Apollos 
1CO.3.7	So then neither is he that plants any thing, neither he that waters; but God-The Father that gives the increase.
1CO.3.8	Now he that plants and he that waters are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.
1CO.3.9	For we are labourers together with God-The Father: you
1CO.3.10	According to the grace of God-The Father which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds thereon. But let every man take heed how he builds thereupon.
1CO.3.11	For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Yeshua 
1CO.3.12	Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;
1CO.3.13	Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is.
1CO.3.14	If any man’s work abide which he has built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.
1CO.3.15	If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer 
1CO.3.16	Know you
1CO.3.17	If any man defile the temple of God-The Father, him shall God-The Father destroy; for the temple of God-The Father is holy, which 
1CO.3.18	Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.
1CO.3.19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God-The Father. For it is written, He takes the wise in their own craftiness.
1CO.3.20	And again, The Lord - Kurios knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.
1CO.3.21	Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;
1CO.3.22	Whether Sha’ul 
1CO.3.23	And you
1CO.4.1	Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Moshiach 
1CO.4.2	Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
1CO.4.3	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yes, I judge not my own self.
1CO.4.4	For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that me is the Lord - Kurios.
1CO.4.5	Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord - Kurios come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God-The Father.
1CO.4.6	And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and 
1CO.4.7	For who makes you
1CO.4.8	Now you
1CO.4.9	For I think that God-The Father has set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.
1CO.4.10	We 
1CO.4.11	Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;
1CO.4.12	And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer 
1CO.4.13	Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, 
1CO.4.14	I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn 
1CO.4.15	For though you
1CO.4.16	For what reason I beseech 
1CO.4.17	For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy 
1CO.4.18	Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.
1CO.4.19	But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord - Kurios will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.
1CO.4.20	For the kingdom of God-The Father 
1CO.4.21	What will you
1CO.5.1	It is reported commonly 
1CO.5.2	And you
1CO.5.3	For I truly, as absent in body, but present in Spirit 
1CO.5.4	In the name of our Lord - Kurios 
1CO.5.5	To deliver such an one unto Satan 
1CO.5.6	Your glorying 
1CO.5.7	Purge out therefore the old leaven, that you
1CO.5.8	Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened 
1CO.5.9	I wrote unto you in an Epistle 
1CO.5.10	Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must you
1CO.5.11	But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.
1CO.5.12	For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not you
1CO.5.13	But them that are without God-The Father judges. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.
1CO.6.1	Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?
1CO.6.2	Do you
1CO.6.3	Know you
1CO.6.4	If then you
1CO.6.5	I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?
1CO.6.6	But brother goes to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.
1CO.6.7	Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because you
1CO.6.8	No, you
1CO.6.9	Know you
1CO.6.10	Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God-The Father.
1CO.6.11	And such were some of you: but you
1CO.6.12	All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.
1CO.6.13	Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God-The Father shall destroy both it and them. Now the body 
1CO.6.14	And God-The Father has both raised up the Lord - Kurios, and will also raise up us by his own power.
1CO.6.15	Know you
1CO.6.16	What? know you
1CO.6.17	But he that is joined unto the Lord - Kurios is one Spirit 
1CO.6.18	Flee fornication. Every sin that a man does is without the body; but he that commit fornication sins against his own body.
1CO.6.19	What? know you
1CO.6.20	For you
1CO.7.1	Now concerning the things whereof you
1CO.7.2	Nevertheless, 
1CO.7.3	Let the husband render unto the wife sexual dues: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.
1CO.7.4	The wife has not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband has not power of his own body, but the wife.
1CO.7.5	Defraud you
1CO.7.6	But I speak this by permission, 
1CO.7.7	For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man has his proper 
1CO.7.8	I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.
1CO.7.9	But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.
1CO.7.10	And unto the married I command, 
1CO.7.11	But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to 
1CO.7.12	But to the rest speak I, not the Lord - Kurios: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.
1CO.7.13	And the woman which has an husband that believes not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.
1CO.7.14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.
1CO.7.15	But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such 
1CO.7.16	For what know you
1CO.7.17	But as God-The Father has distributed to every man, as the Lord - Kurios has called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.
1CO.7.18	Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.
1CO.7.19	Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but 
1CO.7.20	Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.
1CO.7.21	Are you
1CO.7.22	For he that is called in the Lord - Kurios, 
1CO.7.23	You
1CO.7.24	Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, in it abide with God-The Father.
1CO.7.25	Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord - Kurios: yet I give my judgment, as one that has obtained mercy of the Lord - Kurios to be faithful.
1CO.7.26	I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, 
1CO.7.27	Are you
1CO.7.28	But and if you
1CO.7.29	But this I say, brethren, the time 
1CO.7.30	And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;
1CO.7.31	And they that use this world, as not abusing 
1CO.7.32	But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord - Kurios, how he may please the Lord - Kurios:
1CO.7.33	But he that is married cares for the things that are of the world, how he may please 
1CO.7.34	There is difference 
1CO.7.35	And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely 
1CO.7.36	But if any man think that he behaves himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of 
1CO.7.37	Nevertheless he that stands stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own will, and has so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, does well.
1CO.7.38	So then he that gives 
1CO.7.39	The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord - Kurios.
1CO.7.40	But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit 
1CO.8.1	Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.
1CO.8.2	And if any man think that he knows any thing, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know.
1CO.8.3	But if any man love God-The Father, the same is known of him.
1CO.8.4	As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol 
1CO.8.5	For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)
1CO.8.6	But to us 
1CO.8.7	However 
1CO.8.8	But meat commends us not to God-The Father: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.
1CO.8.9	But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.
1CO.8.10	For if any man see you
1CO.8.11	And through your
1CO.8.12	But when you
1CO.8.13	For what reason, if meat make my brother to offend 
1CO.9.1	Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Yeshua 
1CO.9.2	If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of my apostleship are you
1CO.9.3	Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,
1CO.9.4	Have we not power to eat and to drink?
1CO.9.5	Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and 
1CO.9.6	Or I only and Bar-Nabba 
1CO.9.7	Who goes a warfare any time at his own charges? who plants a vineyard, and eats not of the fruit thereof? or who feeds a flock, and eats not of the milk of the flock?
1CO.9.8	Say I these things as a man? or says not the law the same also?
1CO.9.9	For it is written in the law of Moshe 
1CO.9.10	Or says he 
1CO.9.11	If we have sown unto you spiritual things, 
1CO.9.12	If others be partakers of 
1CO.9.13	Do you
1CO.9.14	Even so has the Lord - Kurios ordained that they which preach the Gospel 
1CO.9.15	But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for 
1CO.9.16	For though I preach the Gospel 
1CO.9.17	For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation 
1CO.9.18	What is my reward then? 
1CO.9.19	For though I be free from all 
1CO.9.20	And unto the Y’hudim 
1CO.9.21	To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God-The Father, but under the law to Moshiach 
1CO.9.22	To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all 
1CO.9.23	And this I do for the Gospel 
1CO.9.24	Know you
1CO.9.25	And every man that strives for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they 
1CO.9.26	I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beats the air:
1CO.9.27	But I keep under my body, and bring 
1CO.10.1	Moreover, brethren, I would not that you
1CO.10.2	And were all baptized unto Moshe 
1CO.10.3	And did all eat the same spiritual meat;
1CO.10.4	And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Moshiach 
1CO.10.5	But with many of them God-The Father was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
1CO.10.6	Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.
1CO.10.7	Neither be you
1CO.10.8	Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.
1CO.10.9	Neither let us tempt Moshiach 
1CO.10.10	Neither murmur you
1CO.10.11	Now all these things happened unto them for examples 
1CO.10.12	For what reason let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.
1CO.10.13	There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God-The Father 
1CO.10.14	For what reason, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.
1CO.10.15	I speak as to wise men; judge you
1CO.10.16	The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Moshiach 
1CO.10.17	For we 
1CO.10.18	Behold Yisra’el 
1CO.10.19	What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?
1CO.10.20	But I 
1CO.10.21	You
1CO.10.22	Do we provoke the Lord - Kurios to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
1CO.10.23	All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.
1CO.10.24	Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s 
1CO.10.25	Whatsoever is sold in the marketplace, 
1CO.10.26	For the earth 
1CO.10.27	If any of them that believe not bid you 
1CO.10.28	But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that showed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth 
1CO.10.29	Conscience, I say, not your
1CO.10.30	For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?
1CO.10.31	Whether therefore you
1CO.10.32	Give none offence, neither to the Y’hudim 
1CO.10.33	Even as I please all 
1CO.11.1	Be you
1CO.11.2	Now I praise you, brethren, that you
1CO.11.3	But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Moshiach 
1CO.11.4	Every man praying or prophesying, having 
1CO.11.5	But every woman that prays or prophesies with 
1CO.11.6	For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.
1CO.11.7	For a man indeed ought not to cover 
1CO.11.8	For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.
1CO.11.9	Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.
1CO.11.10	For this cause ought the woman to have power on 
1CO.11.11	Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord - Kurios.
1CO.11.12	For as the woman 
1CO.11.13	Judge in yourselves: is it comely 
1CO.11.14	Does not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?
1CO.11.15	But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for 
1CO.11.16	But if any man seem to be contentious 
1CO.11.17	Now in this that I declare 
1CO.11.18	For first of all, when you
1CO.11.19	For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.
1CO.11.20	When you
1CO.11.21	For in eating every one takes before 
1CO.11.22	What? have you
1CO.11.23	For I have received of the Lord - Kurios that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord - Kurios 
1CO.11.24	And when he had given thanks, he broke 
1CO.11.25	After the same manner also 
1CO.11.26	For as often as you
1CO.11.27	For what reason whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink 
1CO.11.28	But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of 
1CO.11.29	For he that eats and drink unworthily, eats and drink damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord - Kurios’s body.
1CO.11.30	For this cause many 
1CO.11.31	For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
1CO.11.32	But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord - Kurios, that we should not be condemned with the world.
1CO.11.33	For what reason, my brethren, when you
1CO.11.34	And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that you
1CO.12.1	Now concerning spiritual 
1CO.12.2	You
1CO.12.3	For what reason I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit 
1CO.12.4	Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit 
1CO.12.5	And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord - Kurios.
1CO.12.6	And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God-The Father which works all in all.
1CO.12.7	But the manifestation of the Spirit 
1CO.12.8	For to one is given by the Spirit 
1CO.12.9	To another faith by the same Spirit 
1CO.12.10	To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another 
1CO.12.11	But all these works that one and the selfsame Spirit 
1CO.12.12	For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also 
1CO.12.13	For by one Spirit 
1CO.12.14	For the body is not one member, but many.
1CO.12.15	If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
1CO.12.16	And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
1CO.12.17	If the whole body 
1CO.12.18	But now has God-The Father set the members every one of them in the body, as it has pleased him.
1CO.12.19	And if they were all one member, where 
1CO.12.20	But now 
1CO.12.21	And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of you
1CO.12.22	No, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:
1CO.12.23	And those 
1CO.12.24	For our comely 
1CO.12.25	That there should be no schism in the body; but 
1CO.12.26	And whether one member suffer 
1CO.12.27	Now you
1CO.12.28	And God-The Father has set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues 
1CO.12.30	Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues 
1CO.12.31	But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet show I unto you a more excellent way.
1CO.13.1	Though I speak with the tongues 
1CO.13.2	And though I have 
1CO.13.3	And though I bestow all my goods to feed 
1CO.13.4	Charity suffers long, 
1CO.13.5	Does not behave itself inappropriate, seeks not her own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil;
1CO.13.6	Rejoices not in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;
1CO.13.7	Bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
1CO.13.8	Charity never fails: but whether 
1CO.13.9	For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
1CO.13.10	But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
1CO.13.11	When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.
1CO.13.12	For now we see through a mirror, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.
1CO.13.13	And now abides faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these 
1CO.14.1	Follow after charity, and desire spiritual 
1CO.14.2	For he that speaks in an 
1CO.14.3	But he that prophesies speaks unto men 
1CO.14.4	He that speaks in an 
1CO.14.5	I would that you
1CO.14.6	Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues 
1CO.14.7	And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?
1CO.14.8	For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?
1CO.14.9	So likewise you
1CO.14.10	There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them 
1CO.14.11	Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks 
1CO.14.12	Even so you
1CO.14.13	For what reason let him that speaks in an 
1CO.14.14	For if I pray in an 
1CO.14.15	What is it then? I will pray with the Spirit 
1CO.14.16	Else when you
1CO.14.17	For you
1CO.14.18	I thank my God-The Father, I speak with tongues 
1CO.14.19	Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that 
1CO.14.20	Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be you
1CO.14.21	In the law it is written, With 
1CO.14.22	For what reason tongues 
1CO.14.23	If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues 
1CO.14.24	But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believes not, or 
1CO.14.25	And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on 
1CO.14.26	How is it then, brethren? when you
1CO.14.27	If any man speak in an 
1CO.14.28	But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God-The Father.
1CO.14.29	Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.
1CO.14.30	If 
1CO.14.31	For you
1CO.14.32	And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
1CO.14.33	For God-The Father is not 
1CO.14.34	Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but 
1CO.14.35	And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.
1CO.14.36	What? came the word of God-The Father out from you? or came it unto you only?
1CO.14.37	If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord - Kurios.
1CO.14.38	But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.
1CO.14.39	For what reason, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues 
1CO.14.40	Let all things be done decently and in order.
1CO.15.1	Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the Gospel 
1CO.15.2	By which also you
1CO.15.3	For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Moshiach 
1CO.15.4	And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
1CO.15.5	And that he was seen of Kefa 
1CO.15.6	After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.
1CO.15.7	After that, he was seen of Ya’akov 
1CO.15.8	And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.
1CO.15.9	For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God-The Father.
1CO.15.10	But by the grace of God-The Father I am what I am: and his grace which 
1CO.15.11	Therefore whether 
1CO.15.12	Now if Moshiach 
1CO.15.13	But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Moshiach 
1CO.15.14	And if Moshiach 
1CO.15.15	Yes, and we are found false witnesses of God-The Father; because we have testified of God-The Father that he raised up Moshiach 
1CO.15.16	For if the dead rise not, then is not Moshiach 
1CO.15.17	And if Moshiach 
1CO.15.18	Then they also which are fallen asleep in Moshiach 
1CO.15.19	If in this life only we have hope in Moshiach 
1CO.15.20	But now is Moshiach 
1CO.15.21	For since by man 
1CO.15.22	For as in Adam 
1CO.15.23	But every man in his own order: Moshiach 
1CO.15.24	Then 
1CO.15.25	For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet.
1CO.15.26	The last enemy 
1CO.15.27	For he has put all things under his feet. But when he says all things are put under 
1CO.15.28	And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God-The Father may be all in all.
1CO.15.29	Else what shall they do which are baptized for the hope of the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?
1CO.15.30	And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?
1CO.15.31	I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Moshiach 
1CO.15.32	If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus 
1CO.15.33	Be not deceived: evil associations, companionships corrupt good manners.
1CO.15.34	Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God-The Father: I speak 
1CO.15.35	But some 
1CO.15.37	And that which you
1CO.15.38	But God-The Father gives it a body as it has pleased him, and to every seed his own body.
1CO.15.39	All flesh 
1CO.15.42	So also 
1CO.15.43	It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:
1CO.15.44	It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
1CO.15.45	And so it is written, The first man Adam 
1CO.15.46	However that 
1CO.15.47	The first man 
1CO.15.48	As 
1CO.15.49	And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
1CO.15.50	Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God-The Father; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.
1CO.15.51	Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
1CO.15.52	In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
1CO.15.53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal 
1CO.15.54	So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
1CO.15.55	O death, where 
1CO.15.56	The sting of death 
1CO.15.57	But thanks 
1CO.15.58	Therefore, my beloved brethren, be you
1CO.16.1	Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia 
1CO.16.2	Upon the first 
1CO.16.3	And when I come, whomsoever you
1CO.16.4	And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.
1CO.16.5	Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia 
1CO.16.6	And it may be that I will abide, yes, and winter with you, that you
1CO.16.7	For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to wait a while with you, if the Lord - Kurios permit.
1CO.16.8	But I will wait at Ephesus 
1CO.16.9	For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and 
1CO.16.10	Now if Timothy 
1CO.16.11	Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.
1CO.16.12	As touching 
1CO.16.13	Watch you
1CO.16.14	Let all your things be done with charity.
1CO.16.15	I beseech 
1CO.16.16	That you
1CO.16.17	I am glad of the coming of Stephanas 
1CO.16.18	For they have refreshed my Spirit 
1CO.16.19	The churches of Asia 
1CO.16.20	All the brethren greet you. Greet you
1CO.16.21	The Greeting of 
1CO.16.22	If any man love not the Lord - Kurios 
1CO.16.23	The grace of our Lord - Kurios 
1CO.16.24	My love 
2CO.1.1	Sha’ul 
2CO.1.2	Grace 
2CO.1.3	Blessed 
2CO.1.4	Who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort which we ourselves are comforted of God-The Father.
2CO.1.5	For as the sufferings of Moshiach 
2CO.1.6	And whether we be afflicted, 
2CO.1.7	And our hope of you 
2CO.1.8	For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia 
2CO.1.9	But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God-The Father which raises the dead:
2CO.1.10	Who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver 
2CO.1.11	You
2CO.1.12	For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly with incorruption, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God-The Father, we have had our Conversation 
2CO.1.13	For we write none other things unto you, than what you
2CO.1.14	As also you
2CO.1.15	And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that you
2CO.1.16	And to pass by you into Macedonia 
2CO.1.17	When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yes yes, and No No?
2CO.1.18	But 
2CO.1.19	For the Son of God-The Father, Yeshua 
2CO.1.20	For all the promises of God-The Father in him 
2CO.1.21	Now he which establishes us with you in Moshiach 
2CO.1.22	Who has also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit 
2CO.1.23	Moreover I call God-The Father for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth 
2CO.1.24	Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith you
2CO.2.1	But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.
2CO.2.2	For if I make you sorry, who is he then that makes me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?
2CO.2.3	And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is 
2CO.2.4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that you
2CO.2.5	But if any have caused grief, he has not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.
2CO.2.6	Sufficient to such a man 
2CO.2.7	So that contrariwise you
2CO.2.8	For what reason I beseech 
2CO.2.9	For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether you
2CO.2.10	To whom you
2CO.2.11	Lest Satan 
2CO.2.12	Furthermore, when I came to Troas 
2CO.2.13	I had no rest in my Spirit 
2CO.2.14	Now thanks 
2CO.2.15	For we are unto God-The Father a sweet savour of Moshiach 
2CO.2.16	To the one 
2CO.2.17	For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God-The Father: but as of with incorruption, but as of God-The Father, in the sight of God-The Father speak we in Moshiach 
2CO.3.1	Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some 
2CO.3.2	You
2CO.3.4	And such trust have we through Moshiach 
2CO.3.5	Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency 
2CO.3.6	Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament 
2CO.3.7	But if the ministration 
2CO.3.8	How shall not the ministration 
2CO.3.9	For if the ministration 
2CO.3.10	For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.
2CO.3.11	For if that which is done away 
2CO.3.12	Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:
2CO.3.13	And not as Moshe 
2CO.3.14	But their minds were blinded: for until this day remains the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament 
2CO.3.15	But even unto this day, when Moshe 
2CO.3.16	Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord - Kurios, the vail shall be taken away.
2CO.3.17	Now the Lord - Kurios is that Spirit 
2CO.3.18	But we all, with open face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord - Kurios, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, 
2CO.4.1	Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we give up not;
2CO.4.2	But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God-The Father deceitfully; but by manifestation of the tcommending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God-The Father.
2CO.4.3	But if our Gospel 
2CO.4.4	In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious Gospel 
2CO.4.5	For we preach not ourselves, but Moshiach 
2CO.4.6	For God-The Father, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts, to 
2CO.4.7	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God-The Father, and not of us.
2CO.4.9	Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
2CO.4.10	Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord - Kurios 
2CO.4.11	For we which live are always delivered unto death for Yeshua 
2CO.4.12	So then death works in us, but life in you.
2CO.4.13	We having the same Spirit 
2CO.4.14	Knowing that he which raised up the Lord - Kurios 
2CO.4.15	For all things 
2CO.4.16	For which cause we give up not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward 
2CO.4.17	For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding 
2CO.4.18	While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen 
2CO.5.1	For we know that if our earthly house of 
2CO.5.2	For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:
2CO.5.3	If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
2CO.5.4	For we that are in 
2CO.5.5	Now he that has wrought us for the selfsame thing 
2CO.5.6	Therefore 
2CO.5.7	(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)
2CO.5.8	We are confident, 
2CO.5.9	For what reason we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.
2CO.5.10	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Moshiach 
2CO.5.11	Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord - Kurios, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God-The Father; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.
2CO.5.12	For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that you
2CO.5.13	For whether we be beside ourselves, 
2CO.5.14	For the love of Moshiach 
2CO.5.15	And 
2CO.5.16	For what reason from this time forth 
2CO.5.17	Therefore if any man 
2CO.5.18	And all things 
2CO.5.19	To wit, that God-The Father was in Moshiach 
2CO.5.20	Now then we are ambassadors for Moshiach 
2CO.5.21	For he has made him 
2CO.6.1	We then, 
2CO.6.2	(For he says, I have heard you
2CO.6.3	Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:
2CO.6.4	But in all 
2CO.6.5	In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;
2CO.6.6	By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit 
2CO.6.7	By the word of truth, by the power of God-The Father, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
2CO.6.8	By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and 
2CO.6.9	As unknown, and 
2CO.6.10	As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and 
2CO.6.11	O 
2CO.6.12	You
2CO.6.13	Now for a recompence 
2CO.6.14	Be you
2CO.6.15	And what concord 
2CO.6.16	And what agreement has the temple of God-The Father with idols? for you
2CO.6.17	For what reason come out from among them, and be you
2CO.6.18	And will be a Father unto you, and you
2CO.7.1	Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and Spirit 
2CO.7.2	Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.
2CO.7.3	I speak not 
2CO.7.4	Great 
2CO.7.5	For, when we were come into Macedonia 
2CO.7.6	Nevertheless God-The Father, that comforts those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus 
2CO.7.7	And not by his coming only, but by the consolation which he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.
2CO.7.8	For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same Epistle 
2CO.7.9	Now I rejoice, not that you
2CO.7.10	For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world works death.
2CO.7.11	For behold this selfsame thing, that you
2CO.7.12	For what reason, though I wrote unto you, 
2CO.7.13	Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yes, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus 
2CO.7.14	For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which 
2CO.7.15	And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you
2CO.7.16	I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all 
2CO.8.1	Moreover, brethren, we do you that is to say of the grace of God-The Father bestowed on the churches of Macedonia 
2CO.8.2	How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
2CO.8.3	For to 
2CO.8.4	Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and 
2CO.8.5	And 
2CO.8.6	Insomuch that we desired Titus 
2CO.8.7	Therefore, as you
2CO.8.8	I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness 
2CO.8.9	For you
2CO.8.10	And herein I give 
2CO.8.11	Now therefore finish the doing 
2CO.8.12	For if there be first a willing mind, 
2CO.8.13	For 
2CO.8.14	But by an equality, 
2CO.8.15	As it is written, He that 
2CO.8.16	But thanks 
2CO.8.17	For indeed he accepted the Exhortation 
2CO.8.18	And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise 
2CO.8.19	And not 
2CO.8.20	Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:
2CO.8.21	Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord - Kurios, but also in the sight of men.
2CO.8.22	And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which 
2CO.8.23	Whether 
2CO.8.24	For what reason show you
2CO.9.1	For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous 
2CO.9.2	For I know the forwardness 
2CO.9.3	Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, you
2CO.9.4	Lest perhaps 
2CO.9.5	Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof you
2CO.9.6	But this 
2CO.9.7	Every man according as he purposes in his heart, 
2CO.9.8	And God-The Father 
2CO.9.9	(As it is written, He has dispersed abroad; he has given to the poor: his righteousness remains forever.
2CO.9.10	Now he that ministers seed to the sower both minister bread for 
2CO.9.11	Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causes through us thanksgiving to God-The Father.
2CO.9.12	For the administration of this service not only supplies the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God-The Father;
2CO.9.13	Whiles by the experiment of this ministration 
2CO.9.14	And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God-The Father in you.
2CO.9.15	Thanks 
2CO.10.1	Now I Sha’ul 
2CO.10.2	But I beseech 
2CO.10.3	For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:
2CO.10.4	(For the weapons of our warfare 
2CO.10.5	Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God-The Father, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Moshiach 
2CO.10.6	And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.
2CO.10.7	Do you
2CO.10.8	For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord - Kurios has given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:
2CO.10.9	That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.
2CO.10.10	For 
2CO.10.11	Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such 
2CO.10.12	For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.
2CO.10.13	But we will not boast of things without 
2CO.10.14	For we stretch not ourselves beyond 
2CO.10.15	Not boasting of things without 
2CO.10.16	To preach the Gospel 
2CO.10.17	But he that glories, let him glory in the Lord - Kurios.
2CO.10.18	For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord - Kurios commendeth.
2CO.11.1	Would to God-The Father you
2CO.11.2	For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present 
2CO.11.3	But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Khav’vah 
2CO.11.4	For if he that comes preaches another Yeshua 
2CO.11.5	For I suppose I was not the least bit behind the very most important apostles.
2CO.11.6	But though 
2CO.11.7	Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that you
2CO.11.8	I robbed other churches, taking wages 
2CO.11.9	And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia 
2CO.11.10	As the tof Moshiach 
2CO.11.11	For what reason? because I love you not? God-The Father knows.
2CO.11.12	But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.
2CO.11.13	For such 
2CO.11.14	And no marvel; for Satan 
2CO.11.15	Therefore 
2CO.11.16	I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.
2CO.11.17	That which I speak, I speak 
2CO.11.18	Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
2CO.11.19	For you
2CO.11.20	For you
2CO.11.21	I speak as concerning reproach 
2CO.11.22	Are they ‘Evri’ot 
2CO.11.23	Are they ministers of Moshiach 
2CO.11.24	Of the Y’hudim 
2CO.11.25	Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;
2CO.11.27	In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.
2CO.11.28	Beside those things that are without, that which comes upon me daily, the care of all the churches.
2CO.11.29	Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?
2CO.11.30	If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern my infirmities.
2CO.11.31	The God-The Father and Father of our Lord - Kurios 
2CO.11.32	In Dammesek 
2CO.11.33	And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.
2CO.12.1	It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord - Kurios.
2CO.12.2	I knew a man in Moshiach 
2CO.12.3	And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God-The Father knows;)
2CO.12.4	How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
2CO.12.5	Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in my infirmities.
2CO.12.6	For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but 
2CO.12.7	And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan 
2CO.12.8	For this thing I besought the Lord - Kurios thrice, that it might depart from me.
2CO.12.9	And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for you
2CO.12.10	Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Moshiach 
2CO.12.11	I am become a fool in glorying; you
2CO.12.12	Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.
2CO.12.13	For what is it wherein you
2CO.12.14	Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
2CO.12.15	And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.
2CO.12.16	But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with deceit.
2CO.12.17	Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?
2CO.12.18	I desired Titus 
2CO.12.19	Again, think you
2CO.12.20	For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and 
2CO.13.1	This 
2CO.13.2	I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:
2CO.13.3	Since you
2CO.13.4	For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives by the power of God-The Father. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God-The Father toward you.
2CO.13.5	Examine yourselves, whether you
2CO.13.6	But I trust that you
2CO.13.7	Now I pray to God-The Father that you
2CO.13.8	For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
2CO.13.9	For we are glad, when we are weak, and you
2CO.13.10	Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord - Kurios has given me to edification, and not to destruction.
2CO.13.11	Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God-The Father of love and peace shall be with you.
2CO.13.12	Greet one another with an holy kiss.
2CO.13.13	All the saints salute you.
2CO.13.14	The grace of the Lord - Kurios 
GAL.1.1	Sha’ul 
GAL.1.2	And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia 
GAL.1.3	Grace 
GAL.1.4	Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God-The Father and our Father:
GAL.1.5	To whom 
GAL.1.6	I marvel that you
GAL.1.7	Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the Gospel 
GAL.1.8	But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other Gospel 
GAL.1.9	As we said before, so say I now again, If any 
GAL.1.10	For do I now persuade men, or God-The Father? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the slave of Moshiach 
GAL.1.11	But I certify you, brethren, that the Gospel 
GAL.1.12	For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught 
GAL.1.13	For you
GAL.1.14	And profited in the Y’hudit 
GAL.1.15	But when it pleased God-The Father, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called 
GAL.1.16	To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:
GAL.1.17	Neither went I up to Yerushalayim 
GAL.1.18	Then after three years I went up to Yerushalayim 
GAL.1.19	But other of the apostles saw I none, save Ya’akov 
GAL.1.20	Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God-The Father, I lie not.
GAL.1.21	Afterwards I came into the regions of Aram 
GAL.1.22	And was unknown by face unto the churches of Y’hudah 
GAL.1.23	But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preaches the faith which once he destroyed.
GAL.1.24	And they glorified God-The Father in me.
GAL.2.1	Then fourteen years after I went up again to Yerushalayim 
GAL.2.2	And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that Gospel 
GAL.2.3	But neither Titus 
GAL.2.4	And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in Moshiach 
GAL.2.5	To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the tof the Gospel 
GAL.2.6	But of these who seemed to be somewhat 
GAL.2.7	But contrariwise, when they saw that the Gospel 
GAL.2.8	(For he that wrought effectually in Kefa 
GAL.2.9	And when Ya’akov 
GAL.2.10	Only 
GAL.2.11	But when Kefa 
GAL.2.12	For before that certain came from Ya’akov 
GAL.2.13	And the other Y’hudim 
GAL.2.14	But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the tof the Gospel 
GAL.2.15	We 
GAL.2.16	Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Yeshua 
GAL.2.17	But if, while we seek to be justified by Moshiach 
GAL.2.18	For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.
GAL.2.19	For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God-The Father.
GAL.2.20	I am crucified with Moshiach 
GAL.2.21	I do not frustrate the grace of God-The Father: for if righteousness 
GAL.3.1	O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, that you
GAL.3.2	This only would I learn of you, Received you
GAL.3.3	Are you
GAL.3.4	Have you
GAL.3.5	He therefore that ministers to you the Spirit 
GAL.3.6	Even as Avraham 
GAL.3.7	Know you
GAL.3.8	And the scripture, foreseeing that God-The Father would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the Gospel 
GAL.3.9	So then they which be of faith are Blessed 
GAL.3.10	For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed 
GAL.3.11	But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God-The Father, 
GAL.3.12	And the law is not of faith: but, The man that does them shall live in them.
GAL.3.13	Moshiach 
GAL.3.14	That the blessing of Avraham 
GAL.3.15	Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though 
GAL.3.16	Now to Avraham 
GAL.3.17	And this I say, 
GAL.3.18	For if the inheritance 
GAL.3.19	For what reason then 
GAL.3.20	Now a mediator is not 
GAL.3.22	But the scripture has concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Yeshua 
GAL.3.23	But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.
GAL.3.24	For what reason the law was our schoolmaster 
GAL.3.25	But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.
GAL.3.26	For you
GAL.3.27	For as many of you as have been baptized into Moshiach 
GAL.3.28	There is neither Jewish 
GAL.3.29	And if you
GAL.4.1	Now I say, 
GAL.4.2	But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.
GAL.4.3	Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:
GAL.4.4	But when the fullness of the time was come, God-The Father sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,
GAL.4.5	To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the sonship of sons.
GAL.4.6	And because you
GAL.4.7	For what reason you
GAL.4.8	However then, when you
GAL.4.9	But now, after that you
GAL.4.10	You
GAL.4.11	I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.
GAL.4.12	Brethren, I beseech 
GAL.4.13	You
GAL.4.14	And my temptation which was in my flesh you
GAL.4.15	Where is then the blessedness you
GAL.4.16	Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?
GAL.4.17	They zealously affect you, 
GAL.4.18	But 
GAL.4.19	My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Moshiach 
GAL.4.20	I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.
GAL.4.21	Tell me, you
GAL.4.22	For it is written, that Avraham 
GAL.4.23	But he 
GAL.4.24	Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.
GAL.4.25	For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia 
GAL.4.26	But Yerushalayim 
GAL.4.27	For it is written, Rejoice, 
GAL.4.28	Now we, brethren, as Yitz’khak 
GAL.4.29	But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him 
GAL.4.30	Nevertheless what says the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.
GAL.4.31	So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.
GAL.5.1	Stand fast therefore in the liberty which Moshiach 
GAL.5.2	Behold, I Sha’ul 
GAL.5.3	For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
GAL.5.4	Moshiach 
GAL.5.5	For we through the Spirit 
GAL.5.6	For in Yeshua 
GAL.5.7	You
GAL.5.8	This persuasion 
GAL.5.9	A little leaven leavens the whole lump.
GAL.5.10	I have confidence in you through the Lord - Kurios, that you
GAL.5.11	And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer 
GAL.5.12	I would they were even cut off which trouble you.
GAL.5.13	For, brethren, you
GAL.5.14	For all the law is fulfilled in one word, 
GAL.5.15	But if you
GAL.5.17	For the flesh lusts against the Spirit 
GAL.5.18	But if you
GAL.5.19	Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are 
GAL.5.20	Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, disagreement 
GAL.5.21	Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told 
GAL.5.22	But the fruit of the Spirit 
GAL.5.23	Meekness, self-control: against such there is no law.
GAL.5.24	And they that are Moshiach 
GAL.5.25	If we live in the Spirit 
GAL.5.26	Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.
GAL.6.1	Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you
GAL.6.2	Bear you
GAL.6.3	For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
GAL.6.4	But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.
GAL.6.5	For every man shall bear his own burden.
GAL.6.6	Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teaches in all good things.
GAL.6.7	Be not deceived; God-The Father is not deceived: for whatsoever a man sows, that shall he also reap.
GAL.6.8	For he that sows to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that sows to the Spirit 
GAL.6.9	And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we give up not.
GAL.6.10	As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all 
GAL.6.11	You
GAL.6.12	As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain 
GAL.6.13	For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
GAL.6.14	But May it not be that I should glory, save in the stake 
GAL.6.15	For in Moshiach 
GAL.6.16	And as many as walk according to this rule, peace 
GAL.6.17	From from this time forth 
GAL.6.18	Brethren, the grace of our Lord - Kurios 
EPH.1.1	Sha’ul 
EPH.1.2	Grace 
EPH.1.3	Blessed 
EPH.1.4	According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:
EPH.1.5	Having predestinated us unto the sonship of children by Yeshua 
EPH.1.6	To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved.
EPH.1.7	In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;
EPH.1.8	Wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;
EPH.1.9	Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:
EPH.1.10	That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Moshiach 
EPH.1.11	In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will:
EPH.1.12	That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Moshiach 
EPH.1.13	In whom you
EPH.1.14	Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.
EPH.1.15	For what reason I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord - Kurios 
EPH.1.16	Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;
EPH.1.17	That the God-The Father of our Lord - Kurios 
EPH.1.18	The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you
EPH.1.19	And what 
EPH.1.20	Which he wrought in Moshiach 
EPH.1.21	Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:
EPH.1.22	And has put all 
EPH.1.23	Which is his body, the fullness of him that fills all in all.
EPH.2.1	And you 
EPH.2.2	Wherein in time past you
EPH.2.3	Among whom also we all had our Conversation 
EPH.2.4	But God-The Father, who is rich in mercy, for his great love which he loved us,
EPH.2.5	Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Moshiach 
EPH.2.6	And has raised 
EPH.2.7	That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in 
EPH.2.8	For by grace are you
EPH.2.9	Not of works, lest any man should boast.
EPH.2.10	For we are his workmanship, created in Moshiach 
EPH.2.11	For what reason remember, that you
EPH.2.12	That at that time you
EPH.2.13	But now in Moshiach 
EPH.2.14	For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition 
EPH.2.15	Having abolished in his flesh the hatred 
EPH.2.16	And that he might reconcile both unto God-The Father in one body by the stake 
EPH.2.17	And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were near.
EPH.2.18	For through him we both have access by one Spirit 
EPH.2.19	Now therefore you
EPH.2.20	And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Yeshua 
EPH.2.21	In whom all the building fitly framed together grows unto an holy temple in the Lord - Kurios:
EPH.2.22	In whom you
EPH.3.1	For this cause I Sha’ul 
EPH.3.2	If you
EPH.3.3	How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,
EPH.3.4	Whereby, when you
EPH.3.5	Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit 
EPH.3.6	That the Goyim 
EPH.3.7	Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God-The Father given unto me by the effectual working of his power.
EPH.3.8	Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Goyim 
EPH.3.9	And to make all 
EPH.3.10	To the intent that now unto the Principalities 
EPH.3.11	According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Moshiach 
EPH.3.12	In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.
EPH.3.13	For what reason I desire that you
EPH.3.14	For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord - Kurios 
EPH.3.15	Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,
EPH.3.16	That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit 
EPH.3.17	That Moshiach 
EPH.3.18	May be able to comprehend with all saints what 
EPH.3.19	And to know the love of Moshiach 
EPH.3.20	Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,
EPH.3.21	Unto him 
EPH.4.1	I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord - Kurios, beseech 
EPH.4.2	With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;
EPH.4.3	Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit 
EPH.4.5	One Lord - Kurios, one faith, one baptism,
EPH.4.6	One God-The Father and Father of all, who 
EPH.4.7	But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Moshiach 
EPH.4.8	For what reason he says, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.
EPH.4.9	(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?
EPH.4.10	He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)
EPH.4.11	And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
EPH.4.12	For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Moshiach 
EPH.4.13	Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God-The Father, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Moshiach 
EPH.4.14	That we 
EPH.4.15	But speaking the tin love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, 
EPH.4.16	From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.
EPH.4.17	This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord - Kurios, that you
EPH.4.18	Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God-The Father through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:
EPH.4.19	Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness (being lustful, loose or lewd; promoting lustful desires in others), to work all uncleanness with greediness.
EPH.4.20	But you
EPH.4.21	If so be that you
EPH.4.22	That you
EPH.4.23	And be renewed in the Spirit 
EPH.4.24	And that you
EPH.4.25	For what reason putting away lying, speak every man twith his neighbour: for we are members one of another.
EPH.4.26	Be you
EPH.4.27	Neither give place to the devil.
EPH.4.28	Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with 
EPH.4.29	Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.
EPH.4.30	And grieve not the holy Spirit 
EPH.4.31	Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and yelling 
EPH.4.32	And be you
EPH.5.1	Be you
EPH.5.2	And walk in love, as Moshiach 
EPH.5.3	But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becomes saints;
EPH.5.4	Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient 
EPH.5.5	For this you
EPH.5.6	Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things comes the wrath of God-The Father upon the children of disobedience.
EPH.5.7	Be not you
EPH.5.8	For you
EPH.5.9	(For the fruit of the Spirit 
EPH.5.10	Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord - Kurios.
EPH.5.11	And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove 
EPH.5.12	For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.
EPH.5.13	But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever does make manifest is light.
EPH.5.14	For what reason he says, Awake you
EPH.5.15	See then that you
EPH.5.16	Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
EPH.5.17	For what reason be you
EPH.5.18	And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit 
EPH.5.19	Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord - Kurios;
EPH.5.20	Giving thanks always for all things unto God-The Father and the Father in the name of our Lord - Kurios 
EPH.5.21	Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God-The Father.
EPH.5.22	Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord - Kurios.
EPH.5.23	For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Moshiach 
EPH.5.24	Therefore as the church is subject unto Moshiach 
EPH.5.25	Husbands, love your wives, even as Moshiach 
EPH.5.26	That he might sanctify 
EPH.5.27	That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
EPH.5.28	So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loves his wife loves himself.
EPH.5.29	For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord - Kurios the church:
EPH.5.30	For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
EPH.5.31	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.
EPH.5.32	This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Moshiach 
EPH.5.33	Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife 
EPH.6.1	Children, obey your parents in the Lord - Kurios: for this is right.
EPH.6.2	Honour your
EPH.6.3	That it may be well with you
EPH.6.4	And, you
EPH.6.5	Servants, be obedient to them that are 
EPH.6.6	Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Moshiach 
EPH.6.7	With good will doing service, as to the Lord - Kurios, and not to men:
EPH.6.8	Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man does, the same shall he receive of the Lord - Kurios, whether 
EPH.6.9	And, you
EPH.6.10	Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord - Kurios, and in the power of his might.
EPH.6.11	Put 
EPH.6.12	For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against Principalities 
EPH.6.13	For what reason take unto you the whole armour of God-The Father, that you
EPH.6.14	Stand therefore, having your waist wrapped around about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;
EPH.6.15	And your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel 
EPH.6.16	Above all, taking the shield of faith, which you
EPH.6.17	And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit 
EPH.6.18	Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit 
EPH.6.19	And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the Gospel 
EPH.6.20	For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
EPH.6.21	But that you
EPH.6.22	Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that you
EPH.6.23	Peace 
EPH.6.24	Grace 
PHP.1.1	Sha’ul 
PHP.1.2	Grace 
PHP.1.3	I thank my God-The Father upon every remembrance of you,
PHP.1.4	Always in every prayer of my for you all making request with joy,
PHP.1.5	For your fellowship in the Gospel 
PHP.1.6	Being confident of this very thing, that he which has begun a good work in you will finish 
PHP.1.7	Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the Gospel 
PHP.1.8	For God-The Father is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels 
PHP.1.9	And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and 
PHP.1.10	That you
PHP.1.11	Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Yeshua 
PHP.1.12	But I would you
PHP.1.13	So that my bonds in Moshiach 
PHP.1.14	And many of the brethren in the Lord - Kurios, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
PHP.1.15	Some indeed preach Moshiach 
PHP.1.16	The one preach Moshiach 
PHP.1.17	But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the Gospel 
PHP.1.18	What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Moshiach 
PHP.1.19	For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit 
PHP.1.20	According to my earnest expectation and 
PHP.1.21	For to me to live 
PHP.1.22	But if I live in the flesh, this 
PHP.1.23	For I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Moshiach 
PHP.1.24	Nevertheless to abide in the flesh 
PHP.1.25	And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;
PHP.1.26	That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Yeshua 
PHP.1.27	Only let your Conversation 
PHP.1.28	And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God-The Father.
PHP.1.29	For unto you it is given in the behalf of Moshiach 
PHP.1.30	Having the same conflict which you
PHP.2.1	If 
PHP.2.2	Fulfill you
PHP.2.4	Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.
PHP.2.5	Let this mind be in you, which was also in Moshiach 
PHP.2.6	Who, being in the form of God-The Father, thought it not robbery to be equal with God-The Father:
PHP.2.7	But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a slave, and was made in the likeness of men:
PHP.2.8	And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the stake 
PHP.2.9	For what reason God-The Father also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:
PHP.2.10	That at the name of Yeshua 
PHP.2.11	And 
PHP.2.12	For what reason, my beloved, as you
PHP.2.13	For it is God-The Father which works in you both to will and to do of 
PHP.2.14	Do all things without murmurings and disputings:
PHP.2.15	That you
PHP.2.16	Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Moshiach 
PHP.2.17	Yes, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.
PHP.2.18	For the same cause also do you
PHP.2.19	But I trust in the Lord - Kurios 
PHP.2.20	For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.
PHP.2.21	For all seek their own, not the things which are Yeshua 
PHP.2.22	But you
PHP.2.23	Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.
PHP.2.24	But I trust in the Lord - Kurios that I also myself shall come shortly.
PHP.2.25	Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus 
PHP.2.26	For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that you
PHP.2.27	For indeed he was sick near unto death: but God-The Father had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
PHP.2.28	I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when you
PHP.2.29	Receive him therefore in the Lord - Kurios with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:
PHP.2.30	Because for the work of Moshiach 
PHP.3.1	Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord - Kurios. To write the same things to you, to me indeed 
PHP.3.2	Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision 
PHP.3.3	For we are the circumcision, which serve in 
PHP.3.4	Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:
PHP.3.5	Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Yisra’el 
PHP.3.6	Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.
PHP.3.7	But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Moshiach 
PHP.3.8	Yes doubtless, and I count all things 
PHP.3.9	And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Moshiach 
PHP.3.10	That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;
PHP.3.11	If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.
PHP.3.12	Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Moshiach 
PHP.3.13	Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but 
PHP.3.14	I press toward the Mark 
PHP.3.15	Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing you
PHP.3.16	Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.
PHP.3.17	Brethren, be followers together of me, and Mark 
PHP.3.18	(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, 
PHP.3.19	Whose end 
PHP.3.20	For our citizenship is in heaven; from what place also we look for the Saviour, the Lord - Kurios 
PHP.3.21	Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
PHP.4.1	Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord - Kurios, 
PHP.4.2	I beseech 
PHP.4.3	And I intreat you
PHP.4.4	Rejoice in the Lord - Kurios always: 
PHP.4.5	Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord - Kurios 
PHP.4.6	Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God-The Father.
PHP.4.7	And the peace of God-The Father, which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Moshiach 
PHP.4.8	Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things 
PHP.4.9	Those things, which you
PHP.4.10	But I rejoiced in the Lord - Kurios greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again; wherein you
PHP.4.11	Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, 
PHP.4.12	I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer 
PHP.4.13	I can do all things through Moshiach 
PHP.4.14	Yet you
PHP.4.15	Now you
PHP.4.16	For even in Thessalonica 
PHP.4.17	Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.
PHP.4.18	But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus 
PHP.4.19	But my God-The Father shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Moshiach 
PHP.4.20	Now unto God-The Father and our Father 
PHP.4.21	Salute every saint in Moshiach 
PHP.4.22	All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar 
PHP.4.23	The grace of our Lord - Kurios 
COL.1.1	Sha’ul 
COL.1.2	To the saints and faithful brethren in Moshiach 
COL.1.3	We give thanks to God-The Father and the Father of our Lord - Kurios 
COL.1.4	Since we heard of your faith in Moshiach 
COL.1.5	For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof you
COL.1.6	Which is come unto you, as 
COL.1.7	As you
COL.1.8	Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit 
COL.1.9	For this cause we also, since the day we heard 
COL.1.10	That you
COL.1.11	Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;
COL.1.12	Giving thanks unto the Father, which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:
COL.1.13	Who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated 
COL.1.14	In whom we have redemption through his blood, 
COL.1.15	Who is the image of the invisible God-The Father, the firstborn of every creature:
COL.1.16	For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether 
COL.1.17	And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
COL.1.18	And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all 
COL.1.19	For it pleased 
COL.1.20	And, having made peace through the blood of his stake 
COL.1.21	And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in 
COL.1.22	In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:
COL.1.23	If you
COL.1.24	Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Moshiach 
COL.1.25	Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God-The Father which is given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God-The Father;
COL.1.27	To whom God-The Father would make known what 
COL.1.28	Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Moshiach 
COL.1.29	Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which works in me mightily.
COL.2.1	For I would that you
COL.2.2	That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God-The Father, and of the Father, and of Moshiach 
COL.2.3	In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
COL.2.4	And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.
COL.2.5	For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the Spirit 
COL.2.6	As you
COL.2.7	Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as you
COL.2.8	Beware lest any man spoil 
COL.2.9	For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
COL.2.10	And you
COL.2.11	In whom also you
COL.2.12	Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you
COL.2.13	And you--being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh--you hath He quickened together with him, having forgiven us all the trespasses;
COL.2.14	Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his stake 
COL.2.16	Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the Shabbat 
COL.2.17	Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body of Moshiach 
COL.2.18	Let no man judge against you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,
COL.2.19	And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God-The Father.
COL.2.20	For what reason if you
COL.2.21	(Touch not; taste not; handle not;
COL.2.22	Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?
COL.2.23	Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.
COL.3.1	If you
COL.3.2	Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.
COL.3.3	For you
COL.3.4	When Moshiach 
COL.3.5	Mortify 
COL.3.6	For which things’ sake the wrath of God-The Father comes on the children of disobedience:
COL.3.7	In the which you
COL.3.8	But now you
COL.3.9	Lie not one to another, seeing that you
COL.3.10	And have put on the new 
COL.3.11	Where there is neither Greek 
COL.3.12	Put 
COL.3.13	Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Moshiach 
COL.3.14	And above all these things 
COL.3.15	And let the peace of God-The Father rule in your hearts, to the which also you
COL.3.16	Let the word of Moshiach 
COL.3.17	And whatsoever you
COL.3.18	Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord - Kurios.
COL.3.19	Husbands, love 
COL.3.20	Children, obey 
COL.3.21	Fathers, provoke not your children 
COL.3.22	Servants, obey in all things 
COL.3.23	And whatsoever you
COL.3.24	Knowing that of the Lord - Kurios you
COL.3.25	But he that does wrong shall receive for the wrong which he has done: and there is no respect of persons.
COL.4.1	Masters, give unto 
COL.4.2	Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;
COL.4.3	Withal praying also for us, that God-The Father would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Moshiach 
COL.4.4	That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.
COL.4.5	Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.
COL.4.6	Let your speech 
COL.4.7	All my state shall Tychicus 
COL.4.8	Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;
COL.4.9	With Onesimus 
COL.4.10	Aristarchus

COL.4.18	The Greeting by the hand of me Sha’ul 
1TH.1.1	Sha’ul 
1TH.1.2	We give thanks to God-The Father always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;
1TH.1.3	Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord - Kurios 
1TH.1.4	Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God-The Father.
1TH.1.5	For our Gospel 
1TH.1.6	And you
1TH.1.7	So that you
1TH.1.8	For from you sounded out the word of the Lord - Kurios not only in Macedonia 
1TH.1.9	For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how you
1TH.1.10	And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, 
1TH.2.1	For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:
1TH.2.2	But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you
1TH.2.3	For our Exhortation 
1TH.2.4	But as we were allowed of God-The Father to be put in trust with the Gospel 
1TH.2.5	For neither at any time used we flattering words, as you
1TH.2.6	Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor 
1TH.2.7	But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherishes her children:
1TH.2.8	So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the Gospel 
1TH.2.9	For you
1TH.2.10	You
1TH.2.11	As you
1TH.2.12	That you
1TH.2.13	For this cause also thank we God-The Father without ceasing, because, when you
1TH.2.14	For you
1TH.2.15	Who both killed the Lord - Kurios 
1TH.2.16	Forbidding us to speak to the Goyim 
1TH.2.17	But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.
1TH.2.18	For what reason we would have come unto you, even I Sha’ul 
1TH.2.19	For what 
1TH.2.20	For you
1TH.3.1	For what reason when we could no longer refrain 
1TH.3.2	And sent Timothy 
1TH.3.3	That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.
1TH.3.4	For truly, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer 
1TH.3.5	For this cause, when I could no longer refrain 
1TH.3.6	But now when Timothy 
1TH.3.7	Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:
1TH.3.8	For now we live, if you
1TH.3.9	For what thanks can we render to God-The Father again for you, for all the joy which we joy for your sakes before our God-The Father;
1TH.3.10	Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?
1TH.3.11	Now God-The Father himself and our Father, and our Lord - Kurios 
1TH.3.12	And the Lord - Kurios make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all 
1TH.3.13	To the end he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God-The Father, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord - Kurios 
1TH.4.1	Furthermore then we beseech 
1TH.4.2	For you
1TH.4.3	For this is the will of God-The Father, 
1TH.4.4	That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;
1TH.4.5	Not in the lust of concupiscence 
1TH.4.6	That no 
1TH.4.7	For God-The Father has not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.
1TH.4.8	He therefore that despises, despises not man, but God-The Father, who has also given unto us his holy Spirit 
1TH.4.9	But as touching brotherly love you
1TH.4.10	And indeed you
1TH.4.11	And that you
1TH.4.12	That you
1TH.4.13	But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that you
1TH.4.14	For if we believe that Yeshua 
1TH.4.15	For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord - Kurios, that we which are alive 
1TH.4.16	For the Lord - Kurios himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God-The Father: and the dead in Moshiach 
1TH.4.17	Then we which are alive 
1TH.4.18	For what reason comfort one another with these words.
1TH.5.1	But of the times and the seasons, brethren, you
1TH.5.2	For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord - Kurios so comes as a thief in the night.
1TH.5.3	For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction comes upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
1TH.5.4	But you
1TH.5.5	You
1TH.5.6	Therefore let us not sleep, as 
1TH.5.7	For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.
1TH.5.8	But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.
1TH.5.9	For God-The Father has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord - Kurios 
1TH.5.10	Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.
1TH.5.11	For what reason comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also you
1TH.5.12	And we beseech 
1TH.5.13	And to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. 
1TH.5.14	Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all 
1TH.5.15	See that none render evil for evil unto any 
1TH.5.16	Rejoice evermore.
1TH.5.17	Pray without ceasing.
1TH.5.18	In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God-The Father in Moshiach 
1TH.5.19	Quench not the Spirit 
1TH.5.20	Despise not prophesyings.
1TH.5.21	but Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
1TH.5.22	Abstain from all appearance of evil.
1TH.5.23	And the very God-The Father of peace sanctify 
1TH.5.24	Faithful 
1TH.5.25	Brethren, pray for us.
1TH.5.26	Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.
1TH.5.27	I charge you by the Lord - Kurios that this Epistle 
1TH.5.28	The grace of our Lord - Kurios 
2TH.1.1	Sha’ul 
2TH.1.2	Grace unto you, and peace, from God-The Father our Father and the Lord - Kurios 
2TH.1.3	We are bound to thank God-The Father always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith grows exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other abounds;
2TH.1.4	So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God-The Father for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you
2TH.1.6	Seeing 
2TH.1.7	And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord - Kurios 
2TH.1.8	In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God-The Father, and that obey not the Gospel 
2TH.1.9	Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord - Kurios, and from the glory of his power;
2TH.1.10	When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe 
2TH.1.11	For what reason also we pray always for you, that our God-The Father would count you worthy of 
2TH.1.12	That the name of our Lord - Kurios 
2TH.2.1	Now we beseech 
2TH.2.2	That you
2TH.2.3	Let no man deceive you by any means: for 
2TH.2.4	Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God-The Father, or that is worshipped; so that he as God-The Father sits in the temple of God-The Father, showing himself that he is God-The Father.
2TH.2.5	Remember you
2TH.2.6	And now you
2TH.2.7	For the mystery of iniquity does already work: only he who now lets 
2TH.2.8	And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord - Kurios shall consume with the Spirit 
2TH.2.10	And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.
2TH.2.11	And for this cause God-The Father shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:
2TH.2.12	That they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
2TH.2.13	But we are bound to give thanks always to God-The Father for you, brethren beloved of the Lord - Kurios, because God-The Father has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit 
2TH.2.14	Whereunto he called you by our Gospel 
2TH.2.15	Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which you
2TH.2.16	Now our Lord - Kurios 
2TH.2.17	Comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work.
2TH.3.1	Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord - Kurios may have 
2TH.3.2	And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all 
2TH.3.3	But the Lord - Kurios is faithful, who shall establish you, and keep 
2TH.3.4	And we have confidence in the Lord - Kurios touching you, that you
2TH.3.5	And the Lord - Kurios direct your hearts into the love of God-The Father, and into the patient waiting for Moshiach 
2TH.3.6	Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord - Kurios 
2TH.3.7	For yourselves know how you
2TH.3.8	Neither did we eat any man’s bread for nothing; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:
2TH.3.9	Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an example unto you to follow us.
2TH.3.10	For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.
2TH.3.11	For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.
2TH.3.12	Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord - Kurios 
2TH.3.13	But you
2TH.3.14	And if any man obey not our word by this Epistle 
2TH.3.15	Yet count 
2TH.3.16	Now the Lord - Kurios of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord - Kurios 
2TH.3.17	The Greeting of Sha’ul 
2TH.3.18	The grace of our Lord - Kurios 
1TI.1.1	Sha’ul 
1TI.1.2	Unto Timothy 
1TI.1.3	As I besought you
1TI.1.4	Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: 
1TI.1.5	Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and 
1TI.1.6	From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain quarreling 
1TI.1.7	Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.
1TI.1.8	But we know that the law 
1TI.1.9	Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and Profane 
1TI.1.10	For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;
1TI.1.11	According to the glorious Gospel 
1TI.1.12	And I thank Moshiach 
1TI.1.13	Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did 
1TI.1.14	And the grace of our Lord - Kurios was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Moshiach 
1TI.1.15	This 
1TI.1.16	However for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Yeshua 
1TI.1.17	Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God-The Father, 
1TI.1.18	This charge I commit unto you
1TI.1.19	Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:
1TI.1.20	Of whom is Hymenaeus 
1TI.2.1	I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, 
1TI.2.2	For kings, and 
1TI.2.3	For this 
1TI.2.4	Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.
1TI.2.5	For 
1TI.2.6	Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.
1TI.2.7	Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the tin Moshiach 
1TI.2.8	I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.
1TI.2.9	In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array 
1TI.2.10	But 
1TI.2.11	Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
1TI.2.12	But I suffer 
1TI.2.13	For Adam 
1TI.2.14	And Adam 
1TI.2.15	Yet she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.
1TI.3.1	This 
1TI.3.2	A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;
1TI.3.3	Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy profit; but patient, not a brawler 
1TI.3.4	One that rules well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;
1TI.3.5	(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God-The Father?)
1TI.3.6	Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.
1TI.3.7	Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach 
1TI.3.8	Likewise 
1TI.3.9	Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
1TI.3.10	And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being 
1TI.3.11	Even so 
1TI.3.12	Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.
1TI.3.13	For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Moshiach 
1TI.3.14	These things write I unto you
1TI.3.15	But if I wait long, that you
1TI.3.16	And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God-The Father was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit 
1TI.4.1	Now the Spirit 
1TI.4.2	Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;
1TI.4.3	Forbidding to marry, 
1TI.4.4	For every creature of God-The Father 
1TI.4.5	For it is sanctified by the word of God-The Father and prayer.
1TI.4.6	If you
1TI.4.7	But refuse Profane 
1TI.4.8	For bodily exercise profits for a little time: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.
1TI.4.9	This 
1TI.4.10	For therefore we both labour and suffer 
1TI.4.11	These things command and teach.
1TI.4.12	Let no man despise your
1TI.4.13	Till I come, give attendance to reading, to Exhortation 
1TI.4.14	Neglect not the gift that is in you
1TI.4.15	Meditate upon these things; give yourself wholly to them; that your
1TI.4.16	Take heed unto yourself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this you
1TI.5.1	Rebuke 
1TI.5.2	The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.
1TI.5.3	Honour widows that are widows indeed.
1TI.5.4	But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to offer support for their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God-The Father.
1TI.5.5	Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusts in God-The Father, and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.
1TI.5.6	But she that lives in pleasure is dead while she lives.
1TI.5.7	And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.
1TI.5.8	But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.
1TI.5.9	Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,
1TI.5.10	Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints’ feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.
1TI.5.11	But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to grow 
1TI.5.12	Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.
1TI.5.13	And withal they learn 
1TI.5.14	I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.
1TI.5.15	For some are already turned aside after Satan 
1TI.5.16	If any man or woman that believes have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.
1TI.5.17	Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.
1TI.5.18	For the scripture says, you
1TI.5.19	Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.
1TI.5.20	Them that sin rebuke 
1TI.5.21	I charge 
1TI.5.22	Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep yourself pure.
1TI.5.23	Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for your
1TI.5.24	Some men’s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some 
1TI.5.25	Likewise also the good works 
1TI.6.1	Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God-The Father and 
1TI.6.2	And they that have believing masters, let them not despise 
1TI.6.3	If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, 
1TI.6.4	He is proud, knowing nothing, but sick about questions and strifes of words, whereof comes envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,
1TI.6.5	Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw yourself.
1TI.6.6	But godliness with contentment is great gain.
1TI.6.7	For we brought nothing into 
1TI.6.8	And having food and clothing let us be with that content.
1TI.6.9	But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and 
1TI.6.10	For the love of money is a root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
1TI.6.11	But you
1TI.6.12	Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto you
1TI.6.13	I give you
1TI.6.14	That you
1TI.6.15	Which in his times he shall show, 
1TI.6.16	Who only has immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom 
1TI.6.17	Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God-The Father, who gives us richly all things to enjoy;
1TI.6.18	That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;
1TI.6.19	Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.
1TI.6.20	O Timothy 
1TI.6.21	Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace 
2TI.1.1	Sha’ul 
2TI.1.2	To Timothy 
2TI.1.3	I thank God-The Father, whom I serve from 
2TI.1.4	Greatly desiring to see you
2TI.1.5	When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in you
2TI.1.6	For what reason I put you
2TI.1.7	For God-The Father has not given us the Spirit 
2TI.1.8	Be not you
2TI.1.9	Who has saved us, and called 
2TI.1.10	But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Yeshua 
2TI.1.11	Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Goyim 
2TI.1.12	For the which cause I also suffer 
2TI.1.13	Hold fast the form of sound words, which you
2TI.1.14	That good thing which was committed unto your
2TI.1.15	This you
2TI.1.16	The Lord - Kurios give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus 
2TI.1.17	But, when he was in Rome 
2TI.1.18	The Lord - Kurios grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord - Kurios in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus 
2TI.2.1	you
2TI.2.2	And the things that you
2TI.2.3	you
2TI.2.4	No man that wars entangles himself with the affairs of 
2TI.2.5	And if a man also strive for masteries, 
2TI.2.6	The farmer 
2TI.2.7	Consider what I say; and the Lord - Kurios give you
2TI.2.8	Remember that Yeshua 
2TI.2.9	Wherein I suffer 
2TI.2.10	Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Moshiach 
2TI.2.12	If we suffer 
2TI.2.13	If we believe not, 
2TI.2.14	Of these things put 
2TI.2.15	Study to show yourself approved unto God-The Father, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightly expounding 
2TI.2.16	But shun Profane 
2TI.2.17	And their word will eat as does a canker (something that eats away, corrodes; cancer; gangrene; an ulcer-like sore): of whom is Hymenaeus 
2TI.2.18	Who concerning the thave erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.
2TI.2.19	Nevertheless the foundation of God-The Father stands sure, having this seal, The Lord - Kurios knows them that are his. And, Let every one that names the name of 
2TI.2.20	But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.
2TI.2.21	If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, 
2TI.2.22	Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord - Kurios out of a pure heart.
2TI.2.23	But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.
2TI.2.24	And the slave of the Lord - Kurios must not strive; but be gentle unto all 
2TI.2.25	In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God-The Father perhaps will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;
2TI.2.26	And 
2TI.3.1	This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
2TI.3.2	For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
2TI.3.3	Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent (without self-control; unbridled), fierce, despisers of those that are good,
2TI.3.4	Traitors, headstrong 
2TI.3.5	Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.
2TI.3.6	For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with different lusts,
2TI.3.7	Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
2TI.3.8	Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moshe 
2TI.3.9	But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all 
2TI.3.10	But you
2TI.3.11	Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch 
2TI.3.12	Yes, and all that will live godly in Moshiach 
2TI.3.13	But evil men and seducers shall grow 
2TI.3.14	But continue you
2TI.3.15	And that from a child you
2TI.3.16	All scripture 
2TI.3.17	That the man of God-The Father may be spiritually mature, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.
2TI.4.1	I charge 
2TI.4.2	Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke 
2TI.4.3	For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;
2TI.4.4	And they shall turn away 
2TI.4.5	But watch you
2TI.4.6	For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.
2TI.4.7	I have fought a good fight, I have finished 
2TI.4.8	From this time forth 
2TI.4.9	Do you
2TI.4.10	For Demas 
2TI.4.11	Only Luke 
2TI.4.12	And Tychicus 
2TI.4.13	The cloak that I left at Troas 
2TI.4.14	Alexander 
2TI.4.15	Of whom be you
2TI.4.16	At my first answer no man stood with me, but all 
2TI.4.17	Yet the Lord - Kurios stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and 
2TI.4.18	And the Lord - Kurios shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve 
2TI.4.19	Salute Prisca 
2TI.4.20	Erastus 
2TI.4.21	Do you
2TI.4.22	The Lord - Kurios 
TIT.1.1	Sha’ul 
TIT.1.2	In hope of eternal life, which God-The Father, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;
TIT.1.3	But has in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God-The Father our Saviour;
TIT.1.4	To Titus 
TIT.1.5	For this cause left I you
TIT.1.6	If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.
TIT.1.7	For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God-The Father; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy profit;
TIT.1.8	But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;
TIT.1.9	Holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convict the gainsayers.
TIT.1.10	For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:
TIT.1.11	Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy profit’s sake.
TIT.1.12	One of themselves, 
TIT.1.13	This witness is true. For what reason rebuke 
TIT.1.14	Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.
TIT.1.15	Unto the pure all things 
TIT.1.16	They profess that they know God-The Father; but in works they deny 
TIT.2.1	But speak you
TIT.2.2	That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.
TIT.2.3	The aged women likewise, that 
TIT.2.4	That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,
TIT.2.6	Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.
TIT.2.7	In all things showing yourself a pattern of good works: in doctrine 
TIT.2.8	Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.
TIT.2.10	Not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God-The Father our Saviour in all things.
TIT.2.11	For the grace of God-The Father that brings salvation has appeared to all men,
TIT.2.12	Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;
TIT.2.13	Looking for that Blessed 
TIT.2.14	Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar (particular; special; one’s own) people, zealous of good works.
TIT.2.15	These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke 
TIT.3.1	Put 
TIT.3.2	To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, 
TIT.3.3	For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving different lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, 
TIT.3.4	But after that the kindness and love of God-The Father our Saviour toward man appeared,
TIT.3.5	Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit 
TIT.3.6	Which he shed on us abundantly through Yeshua 
TIT.3.7	That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
TIT.3.9	But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
TIT.3.10	A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;
TIT.3.11	Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sins, being condemned of himself.
TIT.3.12	When I shall send Artemas 
TIT.3.13	Bring Zenas 
TIT.3.14	And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.
TIT.3.15	All that are with me salute you
PHM.1.1	Sha’ul 
PHM.1.2	And to 
PHM.1.3	Grace to you, and peace, from God-The Father our Father and the Lord - Kurios 
PHM.1.4	I thank my God-The Father, making mention of you
PHM.1.5	Hearing of your
PHM.1.6	That the communication of your
PHM.1.7	For we have great joy and consolation in your
PHM.1.8	For what reason, though I might be much bold in Moshiach 
PHM.1.9	Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech 
PHM.1.10	I beseech 
PHM.1.11	Which in time past was to you
PHM.1.12	Whom I have sent again: you
PHM.1.13	Whom I would have retained with me, that in your
PHM.1.14	But without your
PHM.1.15	For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that you
PHM.1.16	Not now as a slave, but above a slave, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto you
PHM.1.17	If you
PHM.1.18	If he has wronged you
PHM.1.19	I Sha’ul 
PHM.1.20	Yes, brother, let me have joy of you
PHM.1.21	Having confidence in your
PHM.1.22	But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
PHM.1.23	There salute you
PHM.1.24	Marcus 
PHM.1.25	The grace of our Lord - Kurios 
HEB.1.1	God-The Father, who at sundry times and in different manners spoke in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,
HEB.1.2	Has in these last days spoken unto us by 
HEB.1.3	Who being the brightness of 
HEB.1.4	Being made so much better than the angels, as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.
HEB.1.5	For unto which of the angels said he at any time, you
HEB.1.6	And again, when he brings in the firstbegotten into the world, he says, And let all the angels of God-The Father worship him.
HEB.1.7	And of the angels he says, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.
HEB.1.8	But unto the Son 
HEB.1.9	you
HEB.1.10	And, you
HEB.1.11	They shall perish; but you
HEB.1.12	And as a vesture shall you
HEB.1.13	But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make your
HEB.1.14	Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?
HEB.2.1	Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let 
HEB.2.2	For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence 
HEB.2.3	How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord - Kurios, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard 
HEB.2.4	God-The Father also bearing 
HEB.2.5	For unto the angels has he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.
HEB.2.6	But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that you
HEB.2.7	you
HEB.2.8	you
HEB.2.9	But we see Yeshua 
HEB.2.10	For it became him 
HEB.2.11	For both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified 
HEB.2.12	Saying, I will declare your
HEB.2.13	And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God-The Father has given me.
HEB.2.14	Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;
HEB.2.15	And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
HEB.2.16	For truly he took not on 
HEB.2.17	For what reason in all things it behoved him to be made like unto 
HEB.2.18	For in that he himself has suffered being tried or tested, he is able to help 
HEB.3.1	For what reason, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Moshiach 
HEB.3.2	Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moshe 
HEB.3.3	For this 
HEB.3.4	For every house is built by some 
HEB.3.5	And Moshe 
HEB.3.6	But Moshiach 
HEB.3.7	For what reason (as the Holy Spirit 
HEB.3.8	Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:
HEB.3.9	When your fathers tried or tested me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.
HEB.3.10	For what reason I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do always err in 
HEB.3.11	So I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)
HEB.3.12	Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God-The Father.
HEB.3.13	But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
HEB.3.14	For we are made partakers of Moshiach 
HEB.3.15	While it is said, To day if you
HEB.3.16	For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Mitzrayim 
HEB.3.17	But with whom was he grieved forty years? 
HEB.3.18	And to whom swore he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?
HEB.3.19	So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
HEB.4.1	Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left 
HEB.4.2	For unto us was the Gospel 
HEB.4.3	For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
HEB.4.4	For he spoke in a certain place of the seventh 
HEB.4.5	And in this 
HEB.4.6	Seeing therefore it remains that some must enter in it, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:
HEB.4.7	Again, he limits a certain day, saying in David 
HEB.4.8	For if Yehoshua 
HEB.4.9	There remains therefore a keeping of a Sabbath to the people of God-The Father.
HEB.4.10	For he that is entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God-The Father 
HEB.4.11	Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.
HEB.4.12	For the word of God-The Father 
HEB.4.13	Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things 
HEB.4.14	Seeing then that we have a great High Priest, that is passed into the heavens, Yeshua 
HEB.4.15	For we have not an High Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tried or tested like as 
HEB.4.16	Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
HEB.5.1	For every High Priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things 
HEB.5.2	Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.
HEB.5.3	And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.
HEB.5.4	And no man takes this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God-The Father, as 
HEB.5.5	So also Moshiach 
HEB.5.6	As he says also in another 
HEB.5.7	Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;
HEB.5.8	Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;
HEB.5.9	And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;
HEB.5.10	Called of God-The Father an High Priest after the order of Malki-Tzedek 
HEB.5.11	Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing you
HEB.5.12	For when for the time you
HEB.5.13	For every one that uses milk 
HEB.5.14	But strong meat belongs to them that are of full age, 
HEB.6.1	Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Moshiach 
HEB.6.2	Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
HEB.6.3	And this will we do, if God-The Father permit.
HEB.6.4	For 
HEB.6.5	And have tasted the good word of God-The Father, and the powers of the world to come,
HEB.6.6	If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God-The Father afresh, and put 
HEB.6.7	For the earth which drink in the rain that comes oft upon it, and brings forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receives blessing from God-The Father:
HEB.6.8	But that which bears thorns and briers 
HEB.6.9	But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.
HEB.6.10	For God-The Father 
HEB.6.11	And we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:
HEB.6.12	That you
HEB.6.13	For when God-The Father made promise to Avraham 
HEB.6.14	Saying, Surely blessing I will bless you
HEB.6.15	And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
HEB.6.16	For men truly swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation 
HEB.6.17	Wherein God-The Father, willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed 
HEB.6.18	That by two Immutable 
HEB.6.19	Which 
HEB.6.20	Where the forerunner is for us entered, 
HEB.7.1	For this Malki-Tzedek 
HEB.7.2	To whom also Avraham 
HEB.7.3	Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God-The Father; abides a priest continually.
HEB.7.4	Now consider how great this man 
HEB.7.5	And truly they that are of the sons of Levi 
HEB.7.6	But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Avraham 
HEB.7.7	And without all contradiction the less is Blessed 
HEB.7.8	And here men that die receive tithes; but there he 
HEB.7.9	And as I may so say, Levi 
HEB.7.10	For he was yet in the waist of his father, when Malki-Tzedek 
HEB.7.11	If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, 
HEB.7.12	For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.
HEB.7.13	For he of whom these things are spoken pertains to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.
HEB.7.14	For 
HEB.7.15	And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Malki-Tzedek 
HEB.7.16	Who is made, not after the law of a carnal 
HEB.7.17	For he testifies, you
HEB.7.18	For there is truly a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.
HEB.7.19	For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope 
HEB.7.20	And inasmuch as not without an oath 
HEB.7.21	(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord - Kurios swore and will not repent, you
HEB.7.22	By so much was Yeshua 
HEB.7.23	And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:
HEB.7.24	But this 
HEB.7.25	For what reason he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God-The Father by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.
HEB.7.26	For such an High Priest became us, 
HEB.7.27	Who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.
HEB.7.28	For the law makes men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, 
HEB.8.1	Now of the things which we have spoken 
HEB.8.2	A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord - Kurios pitched, and not man.
HEB.8.3	For every High Priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore 
HEB.8.4	For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:
HEB.8.5	Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moshe 
HEB.8.6	But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.
HEB.8.7	For if that first 
HEB.8.8	For finding fault to them, he says, Behold, the days come, says the Lord - Kurios, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Yisra’el 
HEB.8.9	Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Mitzrayim 
HEB.8.10	For this 
HEB.8.11	And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord - Kurios: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.
HEB.8.12	For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
HEB.8.13	In that he says, A new 
HEB.9.1	Then truly the first 
HEB.9.2	For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein 
HEB.9.3	And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;
HEB.9.4	Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein 
HEB.9.5	And over it the k’vurim 
HEB.9.6	Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service 
HEB.9.7	But into the second 
HEB.9.8	The Holy Spirit 
HEB.9.9	Which 
HEB.9.11	But Moshiach 
HEB.9.12	Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption 
HEB.9.13	For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh:
HEB.9.14	How much more shall the blood of Moshiach 
HEB.9.15	And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament 
HEB.9.16	For where a testament 
HEB.9.17	For a testament 
HEB.9.18	Whereupon neither the first 
HEB.9.19	For when Moshe 
HEB.9.20	Saying, This 
HEB.9.21	Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.
HEB.9.22	And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no forgiveness 
HEB.9.24	For Moshiach 
HEB.9.25	Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the High Priest enters into the holy place every year with blood of others;
HEB.9.26	For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
HEB.9.27	And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:
HEB.9.28	So Moshiach 
HEB.10.1	For the law having a shadow of good things to come, 
HEB.10.2	For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.
HEB.10.3	But in those 
HEB.10.4	For 
HEB.10.5	For what reason when he comes into the world, he says, Sacrifice and offering you
HEB.10.6	In burnt offerings and 
HEB.10.7	Then said I, Lo, I come 
HEB.10.8	Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and 
HEB.10.9	Then said he, Lo, I come to do you
HEB.10.10	By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Yeshua 
HEB.10.11	And every priest stands daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
HEB.10.12	But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God-The Father;
HEB.10.13	From from this time forth 
HEB.10.14	For by one offering he has perfected forever them that are sanctified.
HEB.10.16	This 
HEB.10.17	And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
HEB.10.18	Now where forgiveness 
HEB.10.19	Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Yeshua 
HEB.10.20	By a new and living way, which he has consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;
HEB.10.21	And 
HEB.10.22	Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.
HEB.10.23	Let us hold fast the profession of 
HEB.10.24	And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:
HEB.10.25	Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some 
HEB.10.26	For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,
HEB.10.27	But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
HEB.10.28	He that despised Moshe 
HEB.10.29	Of how much sorer punishment, suppose you
HEB.10.30	For we know him that has said, Vengeance 
HEB.10.32	But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you
HEB.10.33	Partly, whilst you
HEB.10.34	For you
HEB.10.35	Cast not away therefore your confidence, which has great recompence 
HEB.10.36	For you
HEB.10.37	For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not wait.
HEB.10.38	Now the just shall live by faith: but if 
HEB.10.39	But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.
HEB.11.1	Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
HEB.11.2	For by it the elders obtained a good report.
HEB.11.3	Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God-The Father, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.
HEB.11.4	By faith Hevel 
HEB.11.5	By faith Hanokh 
HEB.11.6	But without faith 
HEB.11.7	By faith No’ah 
HEB.11.8	By faith Avraham 
HEB.11.9	By faith he detained 
HEB.11.10	For he looked for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker 
HEB.11.11	Through faith also Sarah 
HEB.11.12	Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, 
HEB.11.13	These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of 
HEB.11.14	For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.
HEB.11.15	And truly, if they had been mindful of that 
HEB.11.16	But now they desire a better 
HEB.11.17	By faith Avraham 
HEB.11.18	Of whom it was said, That in Yitz’khak 
HEB.11.19	Accounting that God-The Father 
HEB.11.20	By faith Yitz’khak 
HEB.11.21	By faith Ya’akov 
HEB.11.22	By faith Yosef 
HEB.11.23	By faith Moshe 
HEB.11.24	By faith Moshe 
HEB.11.25	Choosing rather to suffer 
HEB.11.26	Esteeming the reproach 
HEB.11.27	By faith he forsook Mitzrayim 
HEB.11.28	Through faith he kept the Passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.
HEB.11.29	By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry 
HEB.11.30	By faith the walls of Yericho 
HEB.11.31	By faith the prostitute Rachav 
HEB.11.32	And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gid’on 
HEB.11.33	Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
HEB.11.34	Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.
HEB.11.35	Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:
HEB.11.36	And others had trial of 
HEB.11.37	They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tried or tested, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;
HEB.11.38	(Of whom the world was not worthy) they wandered in deserts, and 
HEB.11.39	And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:
HEB.11.40	God-The Father having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.
HEB.12.1	For what reason seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which does so easily beset 
HEB.12.2	Looking unto Yeshua 
HEB.12.3	For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest you
HEB.12.4	You
HEB.12.5	And you
HEB.12.6	For whom the Lord - Kurios loves he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives.
HEB.12.7	If you
HEB.12.8	But if you
HEB.12.9	Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected 
HEB.12.10	For they truly for a few days chastened 
HEB.12.11	Now no chastening for the present seems to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.
HEB.12.12	For what reason lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;
HEB.12.13	And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.
HEB.12.14	Follow peace with all 
HEB.12.15	Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God-The Father; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble 
HEB.12.16	Lest there 
HEB.12.17	For you
HEB.12.18	For you
HEB.12.19	And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which 
HEB.12.20	(For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:
HEB.12.21	And so terrible was the sight, 
HEB.12.22	But you
HEB.12.23	To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God-The Father the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,
HEB.12.24	And to Yeshua 
HEB.12.25	See that you
HEB.12.26	Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he has promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.
HEB.12.27	And this 
HEB.12.28	For what reason we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God-The Father acceptably with reverence and godly fear:
HEB.12.29	For our God-The Father 
HEB.13.1	Let brotherly love continue.
HEB.13.2	Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.
HEB.13.3	Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; 
HEB.13.4	Marriage 
HEB.13.6	So that we may boldly say, The Lord - Kurios 
HEB.13.7	Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God-The Father: whose faith follow, considering the end of 
HEB.13.8	Yeshua 
HEB.13.9	Be not carried away with different and strange doctrines. For 
HEB.13.10	We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.
HEB.13.11	For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the High Priest for sin, are burned without the camp.
HEB.13.12	For what reason Yeshua 
HEB.13.13	Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach 
HEB.13.14	For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.
HEB.13.15	By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God-The Father continually, that is, the fruit of 
HEB.13.16	But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God-The Father is well pleased.
HEB.13.17	Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that 
HEB.13.18	Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.
HEB.13.19	But I beseech 
HEB.13.20	Now the God-The Father of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord - Kurios 
HEB.13.21	Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Yeshua 
HEB.13.22	And I beseech 
HEB.13.23	Know you
HEB.13.24	Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy 
HEB.13.25	Grace 
JAS.1.1	Ya’akov 
JAS.1.2	My brethren, count it all joy when you
JAS.1.3	Knowing 
JAS.1.4	But let patience have 
JAS.1.5	If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God-The Father, that gives to all 
JAS.1.6	But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
JAS.1.7	For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord - Kurios.
JAS.1.8	A double minded man 
JAS.1.9	Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
JAS.1.10	But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.
JAS.1.11	For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withers the grass, and the flower thereof falls, and the grace of the fashion of it perishes: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
JAS.1.12	Blessed 
JAS.1.13	Let no man say when he is tried or tested, I am tried or tested of God-The Father: for God-The Father cannot be tried or tested with evil, neither tempts he any man:
JAS.1.14	But every man is tried or tested, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.
JAS.1.15	Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, brings forth death.
JAS.1.16	Do not err, my beloved brethren.
JAS.1.17	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
JAS.1.18	Of his own will begat 
JAS.1.19	For what reason, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:
JAS.1.20	For the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God-The Father.
JAS.1.21	For what reason lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
JAS.1.22	But be you
JAS.1.23	For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror:
JAS.1.24	For he beholds himself, and goes his way, and immediately forgets what manner of man he was.
JAS.1.25	But whoso looks into the perfect law of liberty, and continues 
JAS.1.26	If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridles not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man’s religion 
JAS.1.27	Pure religion and undefiled before God-The Father and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, 
JAS.2.1	My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord - Kurios 
JAS.2.2	For if there come unto your Synagogue a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile clothing;
JAS.2.3	And you
JAS.2.4	Are you
JAS.2.5	Listen, my beloved brethren, Has not God-The Father chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them that love him?
JAS.2.6	But you
JAS.2.7	Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which you
JAS.2.8	If you
JAS.2.9	But if you
JAS.2.10	For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend 
JAS.2.11	For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if you
JAS.2.12	So speak you
JAS.2.13	For he shall have judgment without mercy, that has showed no mercy; and mercy rejoices against judgment.
JAS.2.14	What 
JAS.2.15	If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
JAS.2.16	And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be 
JAS.2.17	Even so faith, if it has not works, is dead, being alone.
JAS.2.18	Yes, a man may say, you
JAS.2.19	you
JAS.2.20	But will you
JAS.2.21	Was not Avraham 
JAS.2.22	See you
JAS.2.23	And the scripture was fulfilled which says, Avraham 
JAS.2.24	You
JAS.2.25	Likewise also was not Rachav 
JAS.2.26	For as the body without the Spirit 
JAS.3.1	My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.
JAS.3.2	For in many things we offend 
JAS.3.3	Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.
JAS.3.4	Behold also the ships, which though 
JAS.3.5	Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasts great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindles!
JAS.3.6	And the tongue 
JAS.3.7	For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed of mankind:
JAS.3.8	But the tongue can no man tame; 
JAS.3.9	Therewith bless we God-The Father, even the Father; and with that curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God-The Father.
JAS.3.10	Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.
JAS.3.11	Does a fountain send forth at the same place sweet 
JAS.3.12	Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so 
JAS.3.13	Who 
JAS.3.14	But if you
JAS.3.15	This wisdom descendeth not from above, but 
JAS.3.16	For where envying and strife 
JAS.3.17	But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, 
JAS.3.18	And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.
JAS.4.1	From from what place 
JAS.4.2	You
JAS.4.3	You
JAS.4.4	You
JAS.4.5	Do you
JAS.4.6	But he gives more grace. For what reason he says, God-The Father resists the proud, but gives grace unto the humble.
JAS.4.7	Submit yourselves therefore to God-The Father. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
JAS.4.8	Draw near to God-The Father, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse 
JAS.4.9	Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and 
JAS.4.10	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord - Kurios, and he shall lift you up.
JAS.4.11	Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaks evil of 
JAS.4.12	There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who are you
JAS.4.13	Go to now, you
JAS.4.14	Whereas you
JAS.4.15	For that you
JAS.4.16	But now you
JAS.4.17	Therefore to him that knows to do good, and does 
JAS.5.1	Go to now, 
JAS.5.2	Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.
JAS.5.3	Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. You
JAS.5.4	Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, cries: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord - Kurios of Tzva’ot 
JAS.5.5	You
JAS.5.6	You
JAS.5.7	Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord - Kurios. Behold, the farmer 
JAS.5.8	Be you
JAS.5.9	Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest you
JAS.5.10	Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord - Kurios, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.
JAS.5.11	Behold, we count them happy which endure. You
JAS.5.12	But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yes be yes; and 
JAS.5.13	Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.
JAS.5.14	Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord - Kurios:
JAS.5.15	And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord - Kurios shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.
JAS.5.16	Confess 
JAS.5.17	Eliyahu 
JAS.5.18	And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.
JAS.5.19	Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;
JAS.5.20	Let him know, that he which converts the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.
1PE.1.1	Kefa 
1PE.1.2	Elect according to the foreknowledge of God-The Father the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit 
1PE.1.3	Blessed 
1PE.1.4	To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for you,
1PE.1.5	Who are kept by the power of God-The Father through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
1PE.1.6	Wherein you
1PE.1.7	That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Yeshua 
1PE.1.8	Whom having not seen, you
1PE.1.9	Receiving the end of your faith, 
1PE.1.10	Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace 
1PE.1.11	Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit 
1PE.1.12	Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the Gospel 
1PE.1.13	For what reason gird up the waist of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Yeshua 
1PE.1.14	As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:
1PE.1.15	But as he which has called you is holy, so be you
1PE.1.16	Because it is written, Be you
1PE.1.17	And if you
1PE.1.18	Forasmuch as you
1PE.1.19	But with the precious blood of Moshiach 
1PE.1.20	Who truly was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,
1PE.1.21	Who by him do believe in God-The Father, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God-The Father.
1PE.1.22	Seeing you
1PE.1.23	Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God-The Father, which lives and abides forever.
1PE.1.24	For all flesh 
1PE.1.25	But the word of the Lord - Kurios endures forever. And this is the word which by the Gospel 
1PE.2.1	For what reason laying aside all malice, and all deceit, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,
1PE.2.2	As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that you
1PE.2.3	If so be you
1PE.2.4	To whom coming, 
1PE.2.5	You
1PE.2.6	For what reason also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Tziyon 
1PE.2.7	Unto you therefore which believe 
1PE.2.8	And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, 
1PE.2.9	But you
1PE.2.10	Which in time past 
1PE.2.11	Dearly beloved, I beseech 
1PE.2.12	Having your Conversation 
1PE.2.13	Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord - Kurios’s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;
1PE.2.14	Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.
1PE.2.15	For so is the will of God-The Father, that with well doing you
1PE.2.16	As free, and not using 
1PE.2.17	Honour all 
1PE.2.18	Servants, 
1PE.2.19	For this 
1PE.2.20	For what glory 
1PE.2.21	For even hereunto were you
1PE.2.22	Who did no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth:
1PE.2.23	Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed 
1PE.2.24	Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes you
1PE.2.25	For you
1PE.3.1	Likewise, you
1PE.3.2	While they behold your pure 
1PE.3.3	Whose adorning let it not be that outward 
1PE.3.4	But 
1PE.3.5	For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God-The Father, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:
1PE.3.6	Even as Sarah 
1PE.3.7	Likewise, you
1PE.3.8	Finally, 
1PE.3.9	Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that you
1PE.3.10	For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no deceit:
1PE.3.11	Let him avoid 
1PE.3.12	For the eyes of the Lord - Kurios 
1PE.3.13	And who 
1PE.3.14	But and if you
1PE.3.15	But sanctify 
1PE.3.16	Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good Conversation 
1PE.3.17	For 
1PE.3.18	For Moshiach 
1PE.3.19	By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;
1PE.3.20	Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God-The Father waited in the days of No’ach 
1PE.3.21	The like figure whereunto 
1PE.3.22	Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God-The Father; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.
1PE.4.1	Forasmuch then as Moshiach 
1PE.4.2	That he no longer should live the rest of 
1PE.4.3	For the time past of 
1PE.4.4	Wherein they think it strange that you
1PE.4.5	Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.
1PE.4.6	For for this cause was the Gospel 
1PE.4.7	But the end of all things is at hand: be you
1PE.4.8	And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.
1PE.4.9	Use hospitality one to another without grudging.
1PE.4.10	As every man has received the gift, 
1PE.4.11	If any man speak, 
1PE.4.12	Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:
1PE.4.13	But rejoice, inasmuch as you
1PE.4.14	If you
1PE.4.15	But let none of you suffer 
1PE.4.16	Yet if [any man suffer 
1PE.4.17	For the time 
1PE.4.18	And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?
1PE.4.19	For what reason let them that suffer 
1PE.5.1	The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Moshiach 
1PE.5.2	Feed the flock of God-The Father which is among you, taking the oversight 
1PE.5.3	Neither as being lords over 
1PE.5.4	And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, you
1PE.5.5	Likewise, you
1PE.5.6	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God-The Father, that he may exalt you in due time:
1PE.5.7	Casting all your care upon him; for he cares for you.
1PE.5.8	Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour:
1PE.5.9	Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.
1PE.5.10	But the God-The Father of all grace, who has called us unto his eternal glory by Moshiach 
1PE.5.11	To him 
1PE.5.12	By Silvanus 
1PE.5.13	The 
1PE.5.14	Greet you
2PE.1.1	Shim’on 
2PE.1.2	Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God-The Father, and of Yeshua 
2PE.1.3	According as his divine power has given unto us all things that 
2PE.1.4	Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these you
2PE.1.5	And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue 
2PE.1.6	And to knowledge self-control; and to self-control patience; and to patience godliness;
2PE.1.7	And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.
2PE.1.8	For if these things be in you, and abound, they make 
2PE.1.9	But he that lacks these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.
2PE.1.10	For what reason the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if you
2PE.1.11	For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord - Kurios and Saviour Yeshua 
2PE.1.12	For what reason I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though you
2PE.1.13	Yes, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting 
2PE.1.14	Knowing that shortly I must put off 
2PE.1.15	Moreover I will endeavour that you
2PE.1.16	For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord - Kurios 
2PE.1.17	For he received from God-The Father the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
2PE.1.18	And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.
2PE.1.19	We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you
2PE.1.20	Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
2PE.1.21	For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God-The Father spoke 
2PE.2.1	But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord - Kurios that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.
2PE.2.2	And many shall follow their pernicious 
2PE.2.3	And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingers not, and their damnation slumbers not.
2PE.2.4	For if God-The Father spared not the angels that sinned, but cast 
2PE.2.5	And spared not the old world, but saved No’ach 
2PE.2.6	And turning the cities of S’dom 
2PE.2.7	And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy Conversation 
2PE.2.8	(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed 
2PE.2.9	The Lord - Kurios knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:
2PE.2.10	But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous 
2PE.2.11	Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord - Kurios.
2PE.2.12	But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;
2PE.2.13	And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, 
2PE.2.14	Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:
2PE.2.15	Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Bil’am 
2PE.2.16	But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man’s voice forbad the madness of the prophet.
2PE.2.17	These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved forever.
2PE.2.18	For when they speak great swelling 
2PE.2.19	While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.
2PE.2.20	For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord - Kurios and Saviour Yeshua 
2PE.2.21	For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known 
2PE.2.22	But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog 
2PE.3.1	This second Epistle 
2PE.3.2	That you
2PE.3.3	Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,
2PE.3.4	And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as 
2PE.3.5	For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God-The Father the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:
2PE.3.6	Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:
2PE.3.7	But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.
2PE.3.8	But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day 
2PE.3.9	The Lord - Kurios is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward 
2PE.3.10	But the day of the Lord - Kurios will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are in it shall be burned up.
2PE.3.12	Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God-The Father, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?
2PE.3.13	Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness.
2PE.3.14	For what reason, beloved, seeing that you
2PE.3.15	And account 
2PE.3.16	As also in all 
2PE.3.17	You
2PE.3.18	But grow in grace, and 
1JN.1.1	That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;
1JN.1.2	(For the life was manifested, and we have seen 
1JN.1.3	That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that you
1JN.1.4	And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.
1JN.1.5	This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God-The Father is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
1JN.1.6	If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:
1JN.1.7	But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Yeshua 
1JN.1.8	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the tis not in us.
1JN.1.9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us 
1JN.1.10	If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
1JN.2.1	My little children, these things write I unto you, that you
1JN.2.2	And he is the Propitiation 
1JN.2.3	And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.
1JN.2.4	He that says, I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the tis not in him.
1JN.2.5	But whoso keeps his word, in him truly is the love of God-The Father perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.
1JN.2.6	He that says he abides in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.
1JN.2.7	Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which you
1JN.2.8	Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shines.
1JN.2.9	He that says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness even until now.
1JN.2.10	He that loves his brother abides in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.
1JN.2.11	But he that hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and knows not to which he goes, because that darkness has blinded his eyes.
1JN.2.12	I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.
1JN.2.13	I write unto you, fathers, because you
1JN.2.14	I have written unto you, fathers, because you
1JN.2.15	Love not the world, neither the things 
1JN.2.16	For all that 
1JN.2.17	And the world passes away, and the lust thereof: but he that does the will of God-The Father abides forever.
1JN.2.18	Little children, it is the last time: and as you
1JN.2.19	They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would 
1JN.2.20	But you
1JN.2.21	I have not written unto you because you
1JN.2.22	Who is a liar but he that denies that Yeshua 
1JN.2.23	Whosoever denies the Son, the same has not the Father:
1JN.2.24	Let that therefore abide in you, which you
1JN.2.25	And this is the promise that he has promised us, 
1JN.2.26	These 
1JN.2.27	But the anointing which you
1JN.2.28	And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.
1JN.2.29	If you
1JN.3.1	Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God-The Father: therefore the world knows us not, because it knew him not.
1JN.3.2	Beloved, now are we the sons of God-The Father, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.
1JN.3.3	And every man that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure.
1JN.3.4	Whosoever commit sin transgresses also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.
1JN.3.5	And you
1JN.3.6	Whosoever abides in him sins not: whosoever sins has not seen him, neither known him.
1JN.3.7	Little children, let no man deceive you: he that does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.
1JN.3.8	He that commit sin is of the devil; for the devil sins from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God-The Father was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
1JN.3.9	Whosoever is born of God-The Father does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God-The Father.
1JN.3.10	In this the children of God-The Father are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever does not righteousness is not of God-The Father, neither he that loves not his brother.
1JN.3.11	For this is the message that you
1JN.3.12	Not as Kayin 
1JN.3.13	Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.
1JN.3.14	We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loves not 
1JN.3.15	Whosoever hates his brother is a murderer: and you
1JN.3.16	Hereby perceive we the love 
1JN.3.17	But whoso has this world’s good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his bowels 
1JN.3.18	My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.
1JN.3.19	And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.
1JN.3.20	For if our heart condemn us, God-The Father is greater than our heart, and knows all things.
1JN.3.21	Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, 
1JN.3.22	And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.
1JN.3.23	And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Yeshua 
1JN.3.24	And he that keeps his commandments dwells in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit 
1JN.4.1	Beloved, believe not every Spirit 
1JN.4.2	Hereby know you
1JN.4.3	And every Spirit 
1JN.4.4	You
1JN.4.5	They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world hears them.
1JN.4.6	We are of God-The Father: he that knows God-The Father hears us; he that is not of God-The Father hears not us. Hereby know we the Spirit 
1JN.4.7	Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God-The Father; and every one that loves is born of God-The Father, and knows God-The Father.
1JN.4.8	He that loves not knows not God-The Father; for God-The Father is love.
1JN.4.9	In this was manifested the love of God-The Father toward us, because that God-The Father sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.
1JN.4.10	Herein is love, not that we loved God-The Father, but that he loved us, and sent his Son 
1JN.4.11	Beloved, if God-The Father so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
1JN.4.12	No man has seen God-The Father at any time. If we love one another, God-The Father dwells in us, and his love is perfected in us.
1JN.4.13	Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit 
1JN.4.14	And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son 
1JN.4.15	Whosoever shall confess that Yeshua 
1JN.4.16	And we have known and believed the love that God-The Father has to us. God-The Father is love; and he that dwells in love dwells in God-The Father, and God-The Father in him.
1JN.4.17	Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.
1JN.4.18	There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear: because fear has torment. He that fears is not made perfect in love.
1JN.4.19	We love him, because he first loved us.
1JN.4.20	If a man say, I love God-The Father, and hates his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God-The Father whom he has not seen?
1JN.4.21	And this commandment have we from him, That he who loves God-The Father love his brother also.
1JN.5.1	Whosoever believes that Yeshua 
1JN.5.2	By this we know that we love the children of God-The Father, when we love God-The Father, and keep his commandments.
1JN.5.3	For this is the love of God-The Father, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.
1JN.5.4	For whatsoever is born of God-The Father overcomes the world: and this is the victory that overcomes the world, 
1JN.5.5	Who is he that overcomes the world, but he that believes that Yeshua 
1JN.5.6	This is he that came by water and blood, 
1JN.5.7	For there are three that bear record in heaven
1JN.5.8	the Spirit 
1JN.5.9	If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God-The Father is greater: for this is the witness of God-The Father which he has testified of his Son.
1JN.5.10	He that believes on the Son of God-The Father has the witness in himself: he that believes not God-The Father has made him a liar; because he believes not the record that God-The Father gave of his Son.
1JN.5.11	And this is the record, that God-The Father has given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
1JN.5.12	He that has the Son has life; 
1JN.5.13	These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God-The Father; that you
1JN.5.14	And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us:
1JN.5.15	And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.
1JN.5.16	If any man see his brother sin a sin 
1JN.5.17	All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.
1JN.5.18	We know that whosoever is born of God-The Father sins not; but he that is begotten of God-The Father keeps himself, and that wicked one touches him not.
1JN.5.20	And we know that the Son of God-The Father is come, and has given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, 
1JN.5.21	Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.
2JN.1.1	The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;
2JN.1.2	For the truth’s sake, which dwells in us, and shall be with us forever.
2JN.1.3	Grace be with you, mercy, 
2JN.1.4	I rejoiced greatly that I found of your
2JN.1.5	And now I beseech 
2JN.1.6	And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as you
2JN.1.7	For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Yeshua 
2JN.1.8	Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.
2JN.1.9	Whosoever transgresses, and abides not in the doctrine of Moshiach 
2JN.1.10	If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into 
2JN.1.11	For he that biddes him God-The Father speed is partaker of his evil deeds.
2JN.1.12	Having many things to write unto you, I would not 
2JN.1.13	The children of your
3JN.1.1	The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius 
3JN.1.2	Beloved, I wish above all things that you
3JN.1.3	For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the tthat is in you
3JN.1.4	I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.
3JN.1.5	Beloved, you
3JN.1.6	Which have borne witness of your
3JN.1.7	Because that for his name’s sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Goyim 
3JN.1.8	We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.
3JN.1.9	I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes 
3JN.1.10	For what reason, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he does, babbling 
3JN.1.11	Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that does good is of God-The Father: but he that does evil has not seen God-The Father.
3JN.1.12	Demetrius 
3JN.1.13	I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto you
3JN.1.14	But I trust I shall shortly see you
JUD.1.1	Y’hudah 
JUD.1.2	Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.
JUD.1.3	Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort 
JUD.1.4	For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God-The Father into lasciviousness 
JUD.1.5	I will therefore put you in remembrance, though you
JUD.1.6	And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
JUD.1.7	Even as S’dom 
JUD.1.8	Likewise also these 
JUD.1.9	Yet Mikha’el 
JUD.1.10	But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.
JUD.1.11	Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Kayin 
JUD.1.12	These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds 
JUD.1.13	Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever.
JUD.1.14	And Hanokh 
JUD.1.15	To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard 
JUD.1.16	These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaks great swelling 
JUD.1.17	But, beloved, remember you
JUD.1.18	How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.
JUD.1.19	These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit 
JUD.1.20	But you
JUD.1.21	Keep yourselves in the love of God-The Father, looking for the mercy of our Lord - Kurios 
JUD.1.22	And of some have compassion, making a difference:
JUD.1.23	And others save with fear, pulling 
JUD.1.24	Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present 
JUD.1.25	To the only wise God-The Father our Saviour, 
REV.1.1	The Revelation of Yeshua 
REV.1.2	Who bore record of the word of God-The Father, and of the testimony of Yeshua 
REV.1.3	Blessed 
REV.1.4	Yochanan 
REV.1.5	And from Yeshua 
REV.1.6	And has made us kings and priests unto God-The Father and his Father; to him 
REV.1.7	Behold, he comes with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they 
REV.1.8	I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, says the Lord - Kurios, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.
REV.1.9	I Yochanan 
REV.1.10	I was in the Spirit 
REV.1.11	Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What you
REV.1.12	And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;
REV.1.13	And in the midst of the seven candlesticks 
REV.1.14	His head and 
REV.1.15	And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.
REV.1.16	And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his Countenance 
REV.1.17	And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:
REV.1.18	I 
REV.1.19	Write the things which you
REV.1.20	The mystery of the seven stars which you
REV.2.1	Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus 
REV.2.2	I know your
REV.2.3	And have borne, and have patience, and for my name’s sake have laboured, and have not fainted.
REV.2.4	Nevertheless I have 
REV.2.5	Remember therefore from what place you
REV.2.6	But this you
REV.2.7	He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit 
REV.2.8	And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna 
REV.2.9	I know your
REV.2.10	Fear none of those things which you
REV.2.11	He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit 
REV.2.12	And to the angel of the church in Pergamos 
REV.2.13	I know your
REV.2.14	But I have a few things against you
REV.2.15	So have you
REV.2.16	Repent; or else I will come unto you
REV.2.17	He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit 
REV.2.18	And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira 
REV.2.19	I know your
REV.2.20	Yet I have a few things against you
REV.2.21	And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she will not to repent of her fornication.
REV.2.22	Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.
REV.2.23	And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the reins 
REV.2.24	But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira 
REV.2.25	But that which you
REV.2.26	And he that overcomes, and keeps my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:
REV.2.27	And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.
REV.2.28	And I will give him the morning star.
REV.2.29	He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit 
REV.3.1	And unto the angel of the church in Sardis 
REV.3.2	Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found your
REV.3.3	Remember therefore how you
REV.3.4	you
REV.3.5	He that overcomes, the same shall be clothed in white clothing; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.
REV.3.6	He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit 
REV.3.7	And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia 
REV.3.8	I know your
REV.3.9	Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan 
REV.3.10	Because you
REV.3.11	Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which you
REV.3.12	Him that overcomes will I make a pillar in the temple of my God-The Father, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God-The Father, and the name of the city of my God-The Father, 
REV.3.13	He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit 
REV.3.14	And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans 
REV.3.15	I know your
REV.3.16	So then because you
REV.3.17	Because you
REV.3.18	I counsel you
REV.3.19	As many as I love, I rebuke 
REV.3.20	Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will eat with him, and he with me.
REV.3.21	To him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.
REV.3.22	He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit 
REV.4.1	After this I looked, and, behold, a door 
REV.4.2	And immediately I was in the Spirit 
REV.4.3	And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and 
REV.4.4	And round about the throne 
REV.4.5	And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and 
REV.4.6	And before the throne 
REV.4.7	And the first beast 
REV.4.8	And the four beasts had each of them six wings about 
REV.4.9	And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who lives forever and ever,
REV.4.10	The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
REV.4.11	you
REV.5.1	And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.
REV.5.2	And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?
REV.5.3	And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.
REV.5.4	And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.
REV.5.5	And one of the elders says unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Y’hudah 
REV.5.6	And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God-The Father sent forth into all the earth.
REV.5.7	And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.
REV.5.8	And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four 
REV.5.9	And they sung a new song, saying, you
REV.5.10	And have made us unto our God-The Father kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.
REV.5.11	And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;
REV.5.12	Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.
REV.5.13	And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, 
REV.5.14	And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four 
REV.6.1	And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.
REV.6.2	And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.
REV.6.3	And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see.
REV.6.4	And there went out another horse 
REV.6.5	And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.
REV.6.6	And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and 
REV.6.7	And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.
REV.6.8	And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.
REV.6.9	And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God-The Father, and for the testimony which they held:
REV.6.10	And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord - Kurios, holy and true, do you
REV.6.11	And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they 
REV.6.12	And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the whole moon became as blood;
REV.6.13	And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casts her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.
REV.6.14	And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
REV.6.15	And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman 
REV.6.16	And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:
REV.6.17	For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?
REV.7.1	And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.
REV.7.2	And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God-The Father: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,
REV.7.3	Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God-The Father in their foreheads.
REV.7.4	And I heard the number of them which were sealed: 
REV.7.5	Of the tribe of Y’hudah 
REV.7.6	Of the tribe of Asher 
REV.7.7	Of the tribe of Shim’on 
REV.7.8	Of the tribe of Zvulun 
REV.7.9	After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues 
REV.7.10	And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God-The Father which sits upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.
REV.7.11	And all the angels stood round about the throne, and 
REV.7.12	Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, 
REV.7.13	And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and from what place came they?
REV.7.14	And I said unto him, Sir, you
REV.7.15	Therefore are they before the throne of God-The Father, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sits on the throne shall dwell among them.
REV.7.16	They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.
REV.7.17	For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God-The Father shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
REV.8.1	And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.
REV.8.2	And I saw the seven angels which stood before God-The Father; and to them were given seven trumpets.
REV.8.3	And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer 
REV.8.4	And the smoke of the incense, 
REV.8.5	And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast 
REV.8.6	And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
REV.8.7	The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of the land was burnt up, and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.
REV.8.8	And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;
REV.8.9	And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.
REV.8.10	And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;
REV.8.11	And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.
REV.8.12	And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.
REV.8.13	And I beheld, and heard an eaglel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!
REV.9.1	And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.
REV.9.2	And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.
REV.9.3	And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
REV.9.4	And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God-The Father in their foreheads.
REV.9.5	And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment 
REV.9.6	And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.
REV.9.7	And the shapes of the locusts 
REV.9.8	And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as 
REV.9.9	And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings 
REV.9.10	And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power 
REV.9.11	And they had a king over them, 
REV.9.12	One woe is past; 
REV.9.13	And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God-The Father,
REV.9.14	Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates 
REV.9.15	And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.
REV.9.16	And the number of the army of the horsemen 
REV.9.17	And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and sulfur: and the heads of the horses 
REV.9.18	By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the sulfur, which issued out of their mouths.
REV.9.19	For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails 
REV.9.20	And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:
REV.9.21	Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.
REV.10.1	And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow 
REV.10.2	And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and 
REV.10.3	And cried with a loud voice, as 
REV.10.4	And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.
REV.10.5	And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,
REV.10.6	And swore by him that lives forever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that in it are, and the earth, and the things that in it are, and the sea, and the things which are in it, that there should be time no longer:
REV.10.7	But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God-The Father should be finished, as he has declared to his servants the prophets.
REV.10.8	And the voice which I heard from heaven spoke unto me again, and said, Go 
REV.10.9	And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take 
REV.10.10	And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.
REV.10.11	And he said unto me, you
REV.11.1	And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God-The Father, and the altar, and them that worship in it.
REV.11.2	But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Goyim 
REV.11.3	And I will give 
REV.11.4	These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God-The Father of the earth.
REV.11.5	And if any man will hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouth, and devours their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.
REV.11.6	These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to strike the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.
REV.11.7	And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.
REV.11.8	And their dead bodies 
REV.11.9	And they of the people and kindreds and tongues 
REV.11.10	And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.
REV.11.11	And after three days and an half the Spirit 
REV.11.12	And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up here. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.
REV.11.13	And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God-The Father of heaven.
REV.11.14	The second woe is past; 
REV.11.15	And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become 
REV.11.16	And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God-The Father on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God-The Father,
REV.11.17	Saying, We give you
REV.11.18	And the nations were angry, and your
REV.11.19	And the temple of God-The Father was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament 
REV.12.1	And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:
REV.12.2	And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.
REV.12.3	And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.
REV.12.4	And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.
REV.12.5	And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God-The Father, and 
REV.12.6	And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has there a place prepared of God-The Father, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred 
REV.12.7	And there was war in heaven: Mikha’el 
REV.12.8	And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.
REV.12.9	And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan 
REV.12.10	And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God-The Father, and the power of his Moshiach 
REV.12.11	And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.
REV.12.12	Therefore rejoice, 
REV.12.13	And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man 
REV.12.14	And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
REV.12.15	And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.
REV.12.16	And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.
REV.12.17	And the dragon was exceedingly angry with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God-The Father, and have the testimony of Yeshua 
REV.13.1	And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.
REV.13.2	And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as 
REV.13.3	And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.
REV.13.4	And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who 
REV.13.5	And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto it to make war forty 
REV.13.6	And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God-The Father, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.
REV.13.7	And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues 
REV.13.8	And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.
REV.13.9	If any man have an ear, let him hear.
REV.13.10	He that leads into captivity shall go into captivity: he that kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
REV.13.11	And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon.
REV.13.12	And he exercises all the power of the first beast before him, and causes the earth and them which dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.
REV.13.13	And he does great wonders, so that he makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,
REV.13.14	And deceives them that dwell on the earth by 
REV.13.15	And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.
REV.13.16	And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a Mark 
REV.13.17	And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the Mark 
REV.13.18	Here is wisdom. Let him that has understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number 
REV.14.1	And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Tziyon 
REV.14.2	And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:
REV.14.3	And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred 
REV.14.4	These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb to wherever he goes. These were redeemed from among men, 
REV.14.5	And in their mouth was found no deceit: for they are without fault before the throne of God-The Father.
REV.14.6	And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting Gospel 
REV.14.7	Saying with a loud voice, Fear God-The Father, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
REV.14.8	And there followed another angel, saying, Bavel 
REV.14.9	And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive 
REV.14.10	The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God-The Father, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:
REV.14.11	And the smoke of their torment ascends up forever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receives the Mark 
REV.14.12	Here is the patience of the saints: here 
REV.14.13	And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed 
REV.14.14	And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud 
REV.14.15	And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in your
REV.14.16	And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.
REV.14.17	And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.
REV.14.18	And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in your
REV.14.19	And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast 
REV.14.20	And the winepress was trampled without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand 
REV.15.1	And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God-The Father.
REV.15.2	And I saw as it were a sea of mirror mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his Mark 
REV.15.3	And they sing the song of Moshe 
REV.15.4	Who shall not fear you
REV.15.5	And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:
REV.15.6	And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles.
REV.15.7	And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God-The Father, who lives forever and ever.
REV.15.8	And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God-The Father, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.
REV.16.1	And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God-The Father upon the earth.
REV.16.2	And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a destructive 
REV.16.3	And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead 
REV.16.4	And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.
REV.16.5	And I heard the angel of the waters say, you
REV.16.6	For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and you
REV.16.7	And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord - Kurios God-The Father Almighty, true and righteous 
REV.16.8	And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.
REV.16.9	And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God-The Father, which has power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.
REV.16.10	And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues 
REV.16.11	And blasphemed the God-The Father of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.
REV.16.12	And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates 
REV.16.13	And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs 
REV.16.14	For they are the spirits of demons, working miracles, 
REV.16.15	Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed 
REV.16.16	And he gathered them together into a place called in the ‘Evri’ot 
REV.16.17	And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.
REV.16.18	And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, 
REV.16.19	And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Bavel 
REV.16.20	And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
REV.16.21	And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, 
REV.17.1	And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come here; I will show unto you
REV.17.2	With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.
REV.17.3	So he carried me away in the Spirit 
REV.17.4	And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:
REV.17.5	And upon her forehead 
REV.17.6	And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Yeshua 
REV.17.7	And the angel said unto me, For what reason did you
REV.17.8	The beast that you
REV.17.9	And here 
REV.17.10	And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, 
REV.17.11	And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes into perdition.
REV.17.12	And the ten horns which you
REV.17.13	These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.
REV.17.14	These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord - Kurios of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him 
REV.17.15	And he says unto me, The waters which you
REV.17.16	And the ten horns which you
REV.17.17	For God-The Father has put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God-The Father shall be fulfilled.
REV.17.18	And the woman which you
REV.18.1	And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.
REV.18.2	And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Bavel 
REV.18.3	For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.
REV.18.4	And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that you
REV.18.5	For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God-The Father has remembered her iniquities.
REV.18.6	Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she has filled fill to her double.
REV.18.7	How much she has glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she says in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.
REV.18.8	Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong 
REV.18.9	And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,
REV.18.10	Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Bavel 
REV.18.11	And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:
REV.18.12	The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,
REV.18.13	And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.
REV.18.14	And the fruits that your
REV.18.15	The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,
REV.18.16	And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!
REV.18.17	For in one hour so great riches is come to nothing. And every shipmaster, and everyone who sails to any place, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,
REV.18.18	And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What 
REV.18.19	And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.
REV.18.20	Rejoice over her, 
REV.18.21	And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast 
REV.18.22	And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in you
REV.18.23	And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in you
REV.18.24	And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.
REV.19.1	And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord - Kurios our God-The Father:
REV.19.2	For true and righteous 
REV.19.3	And again they said, Halleluyah 
REV.19.4	And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God-The Father that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.
REV.19.5	And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God-The Father, all you
REV.19.6	And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord - Kurios God-The Father Omnipotent 
REV.19.7	Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready.
REV.19.8	And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.
REV.19.9	And he says unto me, Write, Blessed 
REV.19.10	And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See 
REV.19.11	And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him 
REV.19.12	His eyes 
REV.19.13	And he 
REV.19.14	And the armies 
REV.19.15	And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it he should strike the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God-The Father.
REV.19.16	And he has on 
REV.19.17	And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the great supper of God-The Father;
REV.19.18	That you
REV.19.19	And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.
REV.19.20	And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the Mark 
REV.19.21	And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which 
REV.20.1	And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
REV.20.2	And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan 
REV.20.3	And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.
REV.20.4	And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and 
REV.20.5	But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This 
REV.20.6	Blessed 
REV.20.7	And when the thousand years are expired, Satan 
REV.20.8	And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog 
REV.20.9	And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God-The Father out of heaven, and devoured them.
REV.20.10	And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet 
REV.20.11	And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
REV.20.12	And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God-The Father; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is 
REV.20.13	And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
REV.20.14	And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
REV.20.15	And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.
REV.21.1	And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.
REV.21.2	And I Yochanan 
REV.21.3	And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God-The Father 
REV.21.4	And God-The Father shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.
REV.21.5	And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.
REV.21.6	And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.
REV.21.7	He that overcomes shall inherit all things; and I will be his God-The Father, and he shall be my son.
REV.21.8	But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and sulfur: which is the second death.
REV.21.9	And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come here, I will show you
REV.21.10	And he carried me away in the Spirit 
REV.21.11	Having the glory of God-The Father: and her light 
REV.21.12	And had a wall great and high, 
REV.21.13	On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.
REV.21.14	And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
REV.21.15	And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.
REV.21.16	And the city lies Foursquare 
REV.21.17	And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred 
REV.21.18	And the building of the wall of it was 
REV.21.19	And the foundations of the wall of the city 
REV.21.20	The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.
REV.21.21	And the twelve gates 
REV.21.22	And I saw no temple in it: for the Lord - Kurios God-The Father Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.
REV.21.23	And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God-The Father did lighten it, and the Lamb 
REV.21.24	And the nations of them which are saved shall walk by means of its light: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.
REV.21.25	And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.
REV.21.26	And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.
REV.21.27	And there shall assuredly not 
REV.22.1	And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God-The Father and of the Lamb.
REV.22.2	In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, 
REV.22.3	And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God-The Father and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:
REV.22.4	And they shall see his face; and his name 
REV.22.5	And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord - Kurios God-The Father gives them light: and they shall reign forever and ever.
REV.22.6	And he said unto me, These sayings 
REV.22.7	Behold, I come quickly: Blessed 
REV.22.8	And I Yochanan
